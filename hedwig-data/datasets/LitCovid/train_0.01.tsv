00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated

00001000	'let us help'- why senior medical students are the next step in battling the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n as senior medical students in the uk , we read dr stein 's letter on the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) 2 and began wondering where we fit in , in this pandemic . as the government heads into a 'war footing ' 13 , there is an increased need for medical staff . there is speculation of bringing back retired doctors , many of who fall into at risk categories . with clinical placement and exams cancelled , we are determined to use our hard-earned skills in some way , to help in what is the biggest global emergency of our lifetime . 
00001000	role of mask/respirator protection against sars-cov-2 \n\n to the editor \n\n since its outbreak on december 31 , 2019 , in wuhan , a central city in china , coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) has now spread to almost all countries in the world . it has been declared a pandemic , and it has infected over 1,041,126 people in a very short time , with 55,132 deaths as ofapril 3 , 2020 . wearing masks/respirators and practicingself-isolation at home have been recommended as guidelines for thepublic . however , the problem is the number of cases among medical personnel . interestingly , a higher risk of infection was noticed in male professionals . there are currently many types of masks/respirators available , ranging from simple surgical masks designed to protect wearers from microorganism transmission and fit loosely to the user 's face , through n95 masks used to prevent users from inhaling small airborne particles . these must fit tightly to the user 's face . masks differ primarily in their maximum internal leakage rate limit . surgical masks are designed to protect against droplets or particles with a diameter of > 100 mum , whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) virus is essentially spherical , albeit slightly pleomorphic , with a diameter of 60-140 nm and 100 times smaller than the pore diameter . thus , surgical masks can not prevent inhalation of small airborne particles ; however , both can protect users from large droplets and sprays . the pn-en 149:2001 standard defines 3 protection classes for half masks : filtering face piece 1 ( ffp1 ) , filtering face piece 2 ( ffp2 ) , and filtering face piece 3 ( ffp3 ) . the maximum internal leakage limit is 25 % for ffp1 , 11 % for ffp2 , and 5 % for ffp3 . class ffp1 masks retain about 80 % of particles smaller than 2 mum , ffp2 ones retain 94 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum , and ffp3 ones retain 99.95 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum ( table ) . \n\n test ffp1 ffp2 ffp3 concentration of harmful substances till 4 x nds till 10 x nds till 30 x nds leakage < 22 % < 8 % < 2 % penetration < 20 % < 6 % < 1 % initial expiration resistance at 95 l/min < 210 pa < 240 pa < 300 pa \n\n filtration efficiency for each class of masks \n\n abbreviations : ffp1 , filtering face piece 1 ; ffp2 , filtering face piece 2 ; ffp3 , filtering face piece 3 ; nds , the highest acceptable concentration of the harmful factor . \n\n at the moment , we may meet divergent recommendations for the use of masks . while the centers for disease control and prevention recommend the use of masks in low-risk and high-risk situations , the world health organization advises applying masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations . long et al conclude in their meta-analysis that the use of n95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza . they suggest that n95 respirators should not be recommended for the general public and non-high-risk medical staff who are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients . \n\n the potential of face masks to reduce the spread of respiratory infections could be useful . wang et al indicated that 10 of 213 medical professionals with no mask were infected by covid-19 as compared with 0 of 278 wearing n95 respirators . \n\n it is also worth noting that the respirator increases resistance to inhalation . the longer they are used , the more difficult breathing becomes because of more absorbed dust . what is more , the effectiveness decreases with the increase of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the respirator and face ( the so-called dead space ) . the concentration of carbon dioxide in the dead space increases with each subsequent exhalation . therefore , masks should be replaced frequently . additionally , to improve the comfort of use , masks use 1-way exhalation valves , which accelerate the circulation of gases.6 \n\n to conclude , the use of protective masks can and should be the first protection against sars-cov-2 transmission to medical personnel . medical personnel should use class ffp3 masks . additionally , the application of visors to cover the entire face during contact with the patient is worth considering . \n\n references \n\n association between 2019-ncov transmission and n95 respirator use . \n\n comparison of performance of three different types of respiratory protection devices . \n\n protecting healthcare staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome : filtration capacity of multiple surgical masks . \n\n a close shave ? performance of p2/n95 respirators in health care workers with facial hair : results of the beards ( adequate respiratory defences ) study . \n\n effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza : a systematic review and meta-analysis . \n\n cloth masks versus medical masks for covid-19 . 
00001000	emergency trauma care during the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in china \n\n background \n\n a novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in wuhan , hubei province , in december 2019 ; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans . china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease . however , a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking . to regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak , we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in wuhan . \n\n main body \n\n the article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 , indications for emergency surgery , and infection prevention and control for medical personnel , providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period . \n\n conclusions \n\n the measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of covid-19 . \n\n background \n\n a novel corona virus disease ( covid-19 ) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) began in wuhan , hubei province , china , in december 2019 . by february 13 , 2020 , more than 60,000 cases were confirmed , nearly 50,000 in hubei alone , and the source of the infection was yet to be definitely determined . the world health organization ( who ) has declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) . considering the current rate of human to human transmission , most countries in the world should be well prepared for the potential global covid-19 pandemic . china is on the frontline in the fight against the virus , and medical staff have become exhausted due to the excessive workload brought on by the outbreak . medical testing tools and personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , such as face shields , goggles , and gloves , have become scarce and have had to be rationed among teams and medical centers , with severe shortage in hubei , the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak . a report from a neurosurgery department of a teaching hospital in wuhan showed that from december 25 , 2019 , to february 6 , 2020 , eight covid-19 suspected patients were admitted , and three were confirmed . consequently , 12 medical personnel were infected ( 11 nurses and one doctor ) , among whom three had been in close contact with the first confirmed case . according to the data released by the national health commission ( nhc ) of the people 's republic of china , a total of 1716 medical personnel infections had been reported nationwide , accounting for 3.8 % of the total confirmed cases by 24:00 on february 11 , 2020 , of which six ( 0.4 % ) had died . of these , hubei province reported 1502 cases , accounting for 87.5 % of the total medical personnel infections , while wuhan city reported 1102 cases , accounting for 73.4 % . notably , medical personnel are the most valuable resource during the outbreak . how to protect them from infection is one of the foremost challenges in the fight against sars-cov-2 . \n\n although china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of sars-cov-2 , severe trauma can still occur . during the outbreak , the population of trauma patients may be diverse in terms of infection status , including patients who were previously healthy , suspected to be infected , confirmed infected , close contacts of infected individuals , and asymptomatic carriers . thus , balancing optimal trauma care while preventing further spread of the viral infection during the outbreak is a major challenge . \n\n to our knowledge , there is no relevant consensus or clinical guideline available on the indications of , timing of or perioperative protection during emergency surgery for trauma . to protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of trauma care , we have summarized the recommended perioperative infection prevention and control measures for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 based on current practical experience in china and the published literature on surgical practice during the past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) , ebola virus , and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n main text \n\n general principles \n\n special requirements for the hospitals receiving trauma patients during the outbreak \n\n emergency department : set up a triage area for assessment of all patients at admission , allowing early recognition of possible sars-cov-2 infection and immediate isolation of patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection in an area separate from other patients . \n\n radiology department : a dedicated ct room should be kept on standby for the examination of infected patients . \n\n operating room ( or ) : a relatively isolated negative-pressure or is preferable ; if there is no permanent negative-pressure or , a temporarily modified negative-pressure or the main operating suite of the hospital can be converted . \n\n intensive care unit ( icu ) : an isolated area should be prepared in the icu , and suspected patients should be treated in a single space . \n\n intrahospital transport : although an ideal trauma center with a door-to-door ct room and negative-pressure or are preferable in this situation , most regions in china do not operate such facilities . therefore , a predetermined transport route should be used to minimize exposure , and any intrahospital transport should utilize dedicated carts demarcated by a warning logo equipped with protective supplies and hand disinfectants . the patient should wear a medical mask , and the walls and the floor of the passageways and the elevator should be covered with a plastic lining . \n\n to control the spread of covid-19 , basic principles for treating infectious diseases should be followed , and necessary measures should be taken before receiving trauma patients . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n precaution level applicable personnel and scenarios personal protective equipment level 1 triage , emergency department clean non-sterile long gown , disposable head cover , disposable medical mask , and gloves . level 2 close contact with suspected patients , or handling secretions , feces , and personal items belonging to patients ; performing ct scan ( fig . 1 ) disposable head cover , gloves , disposable coverall , n95 respirator or equivalent , goggle or face shield , rubber boots or fluid-resistant overshoes , etc . level 3 close contact with suspected patients , or collecting blood , respiratory tract samples of patients , especially for endotracheal intubation , airway care , and sputum suction , as well as emergency surgery ( fig . 2 ) . on the basis of wearing secondary protective equipment such as goggle or face shield , other protective equipment should be strengthened . for instance , adding disposable surgical clothing and gloves in addition to disposable coverall and gloves . two layers of gloves covering protective clothing and surgical clothes sleeves , respectively , use of a powered air purifying respirator ( papr ) . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n to standardize and simplify the precaution measures and equipment required for different personnel and scenarios in trauma care , we adopted a three-level precaution protocol in trauma care ( table 1 ) . \n\n all levels of precaution were based on implementing standard precautions , including hand hygiene , respiratory hygiene , and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment ( ppe ) according to different risk levels . proper training of the standard donning and doffing procedures is the basis of effective protection . in epidemic areas such as hubei province , all patients can be regarded as potentially suspected patients during the outbreak , and the level of the precaution should be elevated . \n\n triage \n\n classification of the patients suspected cases clinical confirmed cases ( hubei only ) pathogenic confirmed cases diagnostic basis outside hubei province : two of the clinical manifestations with at least one of the epidemiological histories , three of the clinical manifestations without epidemiological history suspected patient in hubei province with ct findings of pneumonia suspected or clinically confirmed patients with at least one pathogenic evidence epidemiological investigation 1 . travel to or residence in wuhan in the 14 days prior to symptom onset ; 2 . close contactb with sars-cov-2 infection ( rrt-pcr positive ) within 14 days before onset ; 3 . exposed to patients from wuhan and surrounding areas , or from a community with patients who reported fever or respiratory symptoms14 d before onset ; 4 . clustering outbreak . - - clinical manifestations and ct scan 1 . fever and/or respiratory symptoms ; 2 . imaging characteristics of covid-19 ( ct : multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes in early stage , which are obvious in the peripheral lung , and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs , and lung consolidation may occur in severe cases ) ; 3 . the total number of white blood cells in the early stage is normal or decreased , and the lymphocyte count is decreased - - pathogenic evidence null null 1 . detection of sars-cov-2 in respiratory specimens and sera by rrt-pcr assays ; 2 . by virus dna sequencing , respiratory or blood samples dna sequence highly homologous with sars-cov-2 . \n\n diagnostic criteria of covid-19a \n\n covid-19 coronavirus induced disease , sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 , rrt-pcr real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \n\n athe diagnostic criteria were defined according to guidance for the diagnosis and management for covid-19 ( 5th edition ) released by national health commission of people 's republic of china in feb. 4 , 2020 \n\n bclose contact is defined as follows : \n\n - healthcare-associated exposure , including providing direct care for covid-19 patients , working with healthcare workers infected with novel coronavirus , visiting patients , or staying in the same close environment as a covid-19 patient \n\n - working together in close proximity or sharing the same classroom environment with a covid-19 patient \n\n - traveling together with a covid-19 patient in any kind of conveyance \n\n - living in the same household as a covid-19 patient \n\n trauma patients during the outbreak should be managed using the relevant contents in table 2 , and they should complete a brief epidemiological investigation at the triage stage . however , the trauma patients ' history may be unreliable , as they may not have time to be detailed . more emphasis should be placed on the objective data . during the outbreak in wuhan , a total of 32 emergency operations were performed in a tertiary care hospital , including 19 suspected and seven pathogenic confirmed cases . in addition , nine covid-19 patients in another tertiary care hospital underwent gastrointestinal surgery , but in all of these patients , covid-19 was diagnosed postoperatively . it is worth noting that there have been many cases of asymptomatic patients with an incubation period . the maximum incubation period was reported to be 24 days . \n\n evaluation \n\n trauma care is highly time dependent and requires rapid and effective evaluation and management . during the outbreak , primary and secondary surveys should be completed while maintaining the premise of effective protection . \n\n general principles of evaluation \n\n dynamic evaluation strategies should be conducted throughout the trauma care process . the personal protective equipment ( ppe ) worn by medical personnel may result in limited or incomplete physical examinations ( such as palpation and auscultation ) . therefore , injury assessment may rely on radiological examinations . \n\n radiology evaluation \n\n a chest ct scan is recommended for all severe trauma patients if there is no contraindication . if the chest ct scan is not possible due to critical condition , the patient should be treated as a suspect for infection until infection is excluded . \n\n level 3 ppe during ct examination \n\n if the hospital has a trauma resuscitation unit , complete x-ray including but not limited to the chest and focused assessment with sonography for trauma ( fast ) in the trauma resuscitation unit should be performed . for hemodynamic stabilization , a ct scan including but not limited to the chest should be performed ( fig . 1 ) . if the hospital does not have a trauma resuscitation unit , patients with hemodynamic instability should be resuscitated in the emergency department and undergo fast simultaneously . once the hemodynamic status is stable enough , the ct scan should be performed as soon as possible . \n\n ct scan protocol for trauma patients suspected of having covid-19 : medical personnel should first determine the method and scope of the scan , including but not limited to the chest , according to the mechanism of injury . for stab wounds , the segment and body cavity near the wound should be examined . for gunshot wounds , due to the high kinetic energy of the projectiles , the tortuous wound path , and the heavy tissue damage , the scanning range should be expanded appropriately . patients who have sustained blunt injuries with high energy , such as traffic injuries , should usually be scanned with enhanced scanning ranging from head to mid-thigh ( including the whole lower limb when there is lower limb injury ) . enhanced scanning is helpful in providing further information on organ injury , and three-dimensional reconstruction of blood vessels and bone should be performed when major vascular and bone injury is suspected . \n\n ct features of covid-19 : it should be noted that the pulmonary imaging changes of covid-19 vary depending on the patient 's age , immunity status , stage of disease at the time of the scan , underlying disease , and drug intervention . reports have shown that in the early stage of infection , ct shows multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes , which are obvious in the peripheral lung and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs . in severe cases , lung consolidation could occur . in addition , special attention should be paid to discerning between covid-19 infection and pulmonary contusion . \n\n blood and pathogen specimen collection \n\n if possible , nasopharyngeal swabs , sputum , lower respiratory tract secretions , and blood samples should be collected and sent for rrt-pcr in the emergency period . if no respiratory tract specimens are collected before the operation due to time constraints , they can be collected during or after the operation . \n\n all specimens shall be deemed to be potentially infectious . collection , transportation , and processing of any clinical specimens should be performed by biological safety training qualified medical staff . level 3 precautions should be adopted to minimize the possibility of exposure . \n\n the results of rrt-pcr may be falsely negative due to the influence of sampling , transportation , extraction , and testing . recent observations have shown that 30 to 40 % of patients with covid-19 ct features were rrt-pcr negative . as a result , the protection standard can not be lowered due to negative results . since the rrt-pcr test can take several hours to confirm the diagnosis , chest ct is recommended as the basis for the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 in suspected patients , especially in areas with a high incidence of the disease . the use of chest ct not only helps to control the spread of the epidemic but can also ensure definitive care for trauma injuries in a timely manner . \n\n emergency surgery \n\n emergency surgery is of great importance for severe trauma patients , the aim of which includes hemorrhage control , contamination abatement , and compartment pressure relief as soon as possible . effective prevention of sars-cov-2 transmission by standard intraoperative protective measures is an important indicator of a successful operation . from the available evidence , sars-cov-2 is spread mainly through respiratory droplets and contact , while aerosol and fecal-oral transmission are still under investigation . from the existing evidence and our practical experience , all medical staff should adopt level 3 precautions when entering the or . \n\n or preparation \n\n an independent negative pressure operation room is the first choice . operations can only be performed when the pressure is between - 10 and - 5 pa . if a negative pressure or is not available , a relatively isolated or with an independent purification system is an alternative option . nevertheless , the purification system should be shut down during the operation , and a final disinfection should be performed postoperatively . as in standard trauma protocols , the more critical patient should be operated on first . if two or more suspected or confirmed infected patients arrive in the or , a 30-min disinfection is warranted before the subsequent operation . the dedicated or should be clearly marked as covid-19 exclusive . \n\n the dedicated covid-19 or should be designed with a special passage and elevator . the design should focus on shortening the outdoor distance , reducing the chance of human contact , and limiting the time spent in suspected contaminated areas . materials and equipment should only be delivered by specially assigned staff . people inside the or are not allowed to leave during the operation , and outdoor personnel should not enter without permission . surgical articles should be clearly identified , and the use of disposable items is recommended . to maintain pressure , surgical supplies ( surgical instruments , dressings , single-use consumables , high-value consumables , medications , and relevant items ) should be well prepared in advance . only unidirectional flow is permitted ( nothing should be taken out once it is entered during the operation ) . personnel movement and the frequency of door opening are strictly limited . nondisposable items should be disposed of postoperatively in strict accordance with regulations . two suction apparatuses are optimal , one of which is for exclusive use by the anesthesiologist . the negative pressure aspirator should be immediately placed on the patient 's face to minimize the spread of respiratory secretions after entering the operation room . \n\n ppe for operation personnel \n\n protective clothing for surgical personnel : a after wearing protective clothing and inner gloves , b after wearing operating clothes and outer gloves \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe donning \n\n the topic of intraoperative protection remains controversial because most surgeons have no experience performing surgery while wearing heavy and airproof contagion gowns and goggles . according to practice in china , some medical personnel wore two surgical gowns , two contagion gowns and four pairs of gloves for surgery during the covid-19 epidemic . instead of enhancing protective effects , such excessive protection can reduce the visual , auditory , and tactile sensitivity of the surgeon , thus reducing the precision of surgical operations ( fig . 2 ) . the influence of excessive protection on the surgeon mainly includes ( 1 ) difficulty breathing , ( 2 ) fog on goggles and face shields that interfere with vision , ( 3 ) constriction of visual fields , ( 4 ) loss of flexibility due to multiple layers of gloves , and ( 5 ) double or triple the duration of the operation . a practical lesson had been learned from the case of a 7-year-old girl with suspected covid-19 infection who was subjected to an urgent craniotomy due to obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a third ventricle germ cell-derived tumor . the surgical team adopted a level 3 precaution including n95 respirators or papr , and full coverage with protective gowns ( shoe covers included ) and sterile surgical gowns . consequently , an operation that would have taken 2-3 h ended up taking 10 h. possible solutions for reducing the impact of ppe on surgery include reducing the or temperature ( minimizing the formation of moisture on goggles ) and enhancing the lighting in the room to obtain better vision . all ppes are fit for single use except papr . the steps of donning and doffing should be completed under professional supervision ( fig . 3 ) . \n\n anesthesia \n\n regional nerve block is the first choice for limb surgeries . general anesthesia is recommended for neurosurgery , torso trauma , or multiple trauma with shock . \n\n attention should be paid to avoid aerosol generation caused by coughing and other causes in airway operations . intubation should be performed after rapid induction and full muscle relaxation to ensure complete disappearance of spontaneous breathing , and sputum aspiration before intubation should be avoided . remote endotracheal intubation by disposable glide scope with an assistant is recommended . awake endotracheal intubation is not recommended for patients with a difficult airway , hypoxia , or unconsciousness . if face mask or laryngeal mask ventilation is able to maintain oxygenation , multiple tools ( fiberoptic bronchoscope , glide scope , light stick , laryngeal mask ) can be used to assist endotracheal intubation after rapid induction of general anesthesia . if not , cricothyroid laryngotomy should be performed without any hesitation . rapid induction via oral intubation is recommended in cases of a possibly full stomach . mask positive pressure ventilation after administration should be avoided . no emetic measure is recommended . extra caution should be taken on when a nasogastric tube is in place . covid-19 can cause pulmonary inflammation that can induce added lung injury , restricted crystal fluid , and protective ventilation . the proper mechanical ventilation parameters include limited tidal volume ( < 8 ml/kg ) and airway pressure ( platform pressure < 30 cm h2o ) ; 5-10 cm h2o positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation ( peep ) is optional for alveoli expansion and oxygenation maintenance . permissive hypercapnia is also acceptable . \n\n surgical strategy \n\n the concept of damage control surgery should be followed to simplify the operation . it is optimal to finish an operation within 90 min , and strategies such as packing hemostasis , external fixation , and temporary abdominal closure are helpful to shorten the operation time . surgical personnel should be highly focused and closely coordinated . gentle movement is essential to avoid accidental injury and contamination caused by the spattering of blood , fluid , and bone debris . limiting rinsing and drainage of bodily fluids is another key to effectively reducing intraoperative contamination . reliable hemostasis should be maintained to prevent bleeding around the incision . excessive negative pressure suction and violent operations are prohibited . it is also suggested that electrotome use is not suitable under this scenario ; if it must be used , the power should be minimized . smoke should be quickly suctioned to avoid aerosol generation . \n\n postoperative management \n\n postoperative management of patients \n\n after the operation , the patient should be transferred to an isolation ward in the icu . the endotracheal tubes should be removed under analgesia to avoid violent coughing while the patient is stable . sputum aspiration should be performed by a closed suction system . trauma and surgery can impair the patient 's immune function . clinically , some asymptomatic covid-19 patients suffered rapid deterioration after surgery . surgeons and anesthesiologists should be aware that acute lung injury caused by covid-19 may exist preoperatively or worsen postoperatively . therefore , special attention should be paid to the monitoring of body temperature , infection , and hemodynamic index . reexamination of chest ct and rrt-pcr tests is also important . for postoperative trauma patients with fever , traumatic , or operative complications should also be considered to differentiate them from covid-19 . attention should be paid to symptomatic and etiological treatment . postoperative dyspnea and hypoxia should also be differentiated from complications such as pulmonary embolism . nutritional support and prevention of other complications ( bacterial infection , stress ulcer , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , and deep venous thrombosis ) should also be strengthened . \n\n quarantine \n\n based on current experience , if the medical personnel complete the operation successfully and comply with all the regulations without any accidental exposure , the patient does not need to be quarantined . otherwise , a 14-day medical observation is obligatory , and timely treatment is needed when any abnormalities occur . notably , some literature recommends a routine 14-day quarantine for relevant personnel involved in the operation for sars-cov-2 confirmed patients . however , extreme safety often results in severe incapacity to help patients , so a balance between safety and efficiency must be maintained . \n\n discussion \n\n the national health commission of china initially decided to temporarily call the disease novel coronavirus pneumonia or ncp . it was not until february 12 , 2020 , that the official name covid-19 was announced by the who . shortly after the who announced the disease 's official name , the virus causing it was named sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , highlighting the new virus 's similarity to the sars virus identified in 2003 . based on epidemiological data up to jan. 4 , 2020 , the estimated r0 was 2.2 ( 95 % ci , 1.4 to 3.9 ) , while the latest study surveying cases up to feb. 14 , 2020 , further calculated that the r0 of covid-19 was 3.77 . therefore , researchers estimated that in terms of infection ability , sars-cov-2 was slightly higher than the sars virus and significantly higher than the mers-cov . according to clinical characteristic analysis of sars-cov-2 infection in china , the mortality was 2.01 % out of 28,018 cases as of feb. 6 , 2020 . by human-to-human transmission , sars-cov-2 had spread rapidly from wuhan , china , to 24 other countries as of feb. 12 , 2020 . the number of cases within china and other countries is rapidly increasing , and it is estimated that for every additional 10 % decrease in transmission rate , the peak population will be reduced by 20-47 % . the cumulative number of infected cases and deaths will be reduced by 23-49 % due to comprehensive interventions . if current interventions continue , it is expected that the number of people infected will peak in early march 2020 . based on the epidemiological analysis , only 1.18 % of the patients had direct contact with wild animals , 31.30 % of the patients had been in wuhan , and 71.80 % of the patients had contact with people from wuhan . common symptoms included fever , cough , and diarrhea . a total of 76.4 % of patients had radiologic findings manifested as pneumonia , with the remaining patients exhibiting normal radiologic findings . poor clinical outcomes can be predicted by disease severity , including oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count , and chest ct manifestations . \n\n the transmission by aerosols is still under investigation . aerosols are solid , liquid , solid , and liquid granular substances suspended in the air , such as dust , smoke , fog , and microorganisms . these may be the `` flying vehicles '' for covid-19 . covid-19 aerosols are related to the increased risk of covid-19 transmission . tracheal intubation , noninvasive ventilation , tracheotomy , manual ventilation before intubation , bronchoscopy , cardiopulmonary resuscitation , sputum suction , and other airway operations , as well as the use of electrotome , suction , and drainage , all inevitably produce a large number of aerosols . when carrying out these operations , the protection and training of medical personnel should be strengthened , and preventive measures to protect against aerosols are recommended , including n95 respirators , papr , goggles or face shields , disposable fluid-resistant gowns , and limiting the number of people in the room . \n\n based on experience from the hospital in wuhan , patients with covid-19 have high mortality after surgery . as of february 14 , 2020 , 6 gastrointestinal operations were performed in the general surgery department of the authors ' hospital ; one 60-year-old male died of respiratory failure 14 days after surgery , and one died of septic shock , for a mortality rate of 33.33 % . another group of eight covid-19 confirmed patients in zhongnan hospital of wuhan university underwent gastrointestinal surgeries ( seven gastrointestinal tumors and one benign case ) ; one patient died of covid-19 after left hemicolectomy with the diagnosis of postoperative recurrence of renal cancer involving the descending colon with intestinal obstruction , and one tumor patient died from postoperative complications of abdominal infection , for a mortality rate of 25 % . trauma patients usually have massive hemorrhage , shock , and contamination . damage control strategies should be complied with to correct fatal triads caused by hypothermia , acidosis , and coagulopathy . meanwhile , effective oxygen therapy and organ function support are also indispensable . \n\n moreover , additional attention should be paid to patients in critical condition and to those who develop severe pneumonia after trauma . among covid-19 patients , critical patients , including patients with respiratory failure , septic shock , and other organ failures , have accounted for 29 % ~32 % . identifying high-risk groups with severe illness can also help reduce the occurrence of poor prognosis . the possible high-risk groups include patients over 65 years old , patients with obesity , and patients with other diseases ( such as chronic pulmonary disease , hypertension , heart disease , kidney disease , diabetes , tumor , and immune deficiency ) . \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe doffing \n\n the covid-19 outbreak poses significant challenges to hospital staff and specifically trauma surgeons , which must offer optimal and timely care despite the circumstances . strict safety protocols must be adhered to when carrying out emergency care for patients with severe trauma and other surgical diseases , which means that all the measures shall be carried out to preserve the ability of the medical staff to achieve the purpose of effective care without sacrificing the safety of all involved . the perspectives in this paper can not be a substitute for clinical judgment and expert consultation but can help provide up-to-date guidance on the clinical management of emergency surgery for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 ( fig . 4 ) . \n\n conclusion \n\n in conclusion , the covid-19 outbreak raises several issues concerning the safety of medical personnel and patients . areas with high incidence rates of covid-19 should conduct operations with caution and protection should be strengthened while ensuring suitable facilities to carry out optimal care with maximal safety . with the accumulation of clinical experience and in-depth research , some of the practices may require modification when additional high-quality evidence emerges . the above is china 's experience in treating trauma patients during the covid-19 outbreak . we hope that this report will help hospitals worldwide prepare for future covid-19 outbreaks and infection control in unexpected conditions . \n\n abbreviations \n\n covid-19 \n\n corona virus disease \n\n sars-cov-2 \n\n severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \n\n

00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region , presented to the emergency with a 3-day history of headaches , dizziness , intermittent nausea , and vomiting . brain mr showed a tumor that was entirely confined within the third ventricle , causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the child has an uncomplicated recovery after surgery , and covid-19 was eventually ruled out after a 14-day quarantine . \n\n finally , we have some additional tips for conducting surgery under level 3 precautions . a comfortable goggle and use of antifogging agent are very helpful . in addition , surgeons should avoid unnecessary conversation and perform the surgery as gently as possible to prevent splashing blood in a negative pressure operating room . \n\n neuro-oncology patients may become infected with covid-19 , and thus surgery for these patients can not be avoided . as neurosurgeons , it is crucial that we do our utmost to care for our patients while ensuring our own safety at the same time . in these challenging times , we have faith that through our concerted efforts , this pandemic will be overcome soon . \n\n publisher 's note \n\n springer nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations . \n\n compliance with ethical

00001000	'let us help'- why senior medical students are the next step in battling the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n as senior medical students in the uk , we read dr stein 's letter on the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) 2 and began wondering where we fit in , in this pandemic . as the government heads into a 'war footing ' 13 , there is an increased need for medical staff . there is speculation of bringing back retired doctors , many of who fall into at risk categories . with clinical placement and exams cancelled , we are determined to use our hard-earned skills in some way , to help in what is the biggest global emergency of our lifetime . 
00001000	role of mask/respirator protection against sars-cov-2 \n\n to the editor \n\n since its outbreak on december 31 , 2019 , in wuhan , a central city in china , coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) has now spread to almost all countries in the world . it has been declared a pandemic , and it has infected over 1,041,126 people in a very short time , with 55,132 deaths as ofapril 3 , 2020 . wearing masks/respirators and practicingself-isolation at home have been recommended as guidelines for thepublic . however , the problem is the number of cases among medical personnel . interestingly , a higher risk of infection was noticed in male professionals . there are currently many types of masks/respirators available , ranging from simple surgical masks designed to protect wearers from microorganism transmission and fit loosely to the user 's face , through n95 masks used to prevent users from inhaling small airborne particles . these must fit tightly to the user 's face . masks differ primarily in their maximum internal leakage rate limit . surgical masks are designed to protect against droplets or particles with a diameter of > 100 mum , whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) virus is essentially spherical , albeit slightly pleomorphic , with a diameter of 60-140 nm and 100 times smaller than the pore diameter . thus , surgical masks can not prevent inhalation of small airborne particles ; however , both can protect users from large droplets and sprays . the pn-en 149:2001 standard defines 3 protection classes for half masks : filtering face piece 1 ( ffp1 ) , filtering face piece 2 ( ffp2 ) , and filtering face piece 3 ( ffp3 ) . the maximum internal leakage limit is 25 % for ffp1 , 11 % for ffp2 , and 5 % for ffp3 . class ffp1 masks retain about 80 % of particles smaller than 2 mum , ffp2 ones retain 94 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum , and ffp3 ones retain 99.95 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum ( table ) . \n\n test ffp1 ffp2 ffp3 concentration of harmful substances till 4 x nds till 10 x nds till 30 x nds leakage < 22 % < 8 % < 2 % penetration < 20 % < 6 % < 1 % initial expiration resistance at 95 l/min < 210 pa < 240 pa < 300 pa \n\n filtration efficiency for each class of masks \n\n abbreviations : ffp1 , filtering face piece 1 ; ffp2 , filtering face piece 2 ; ffp3 , filtering face piece 3 ; nds , the highest acceptable concentration of the harmful factor . \n\n at the moment , we may meet divergent recommendations for the use of masks . while the centers for disease control and prevention recommend the use of masks in low-risk and high-risk situations , the world health organization advises applying masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations . long et al conclude in their meta-analysis that the use of n95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza . they suggest that n95 respirators should not be recommended for the general public and non-high-risk medical staff who are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients . \n\n the potential of face masks to reduce the spread of respiratory infections could be useful . wang et al indicated that 10 of 213 medical professionals with no mask were infected by covid-19 as compared with 0 of 278 wearing n95 respirators . \n\n it is also worth noting that the respirator increases resistance to inhalation . the longer they are used , the more difficult breathing becomes because of more absorbed dust . what is more , the effectiveness decreases with the increase of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the respirator and face ( the so-called dead space ) . the concentration of carbon dioxide in the dead space increases with each subsequent exhalation . therefore , masks should be replaced frequently . additionally , to improve the comfort of use , masks use 1-way exhalation valves , which accelerate the circulation of gases.6 \n\n to conclude , the use of protective masks can and should be the first protection against sars-cov-2 transmission to medical personnel . medical personnel should use class ffp3 masks . additionally , the application of visors to cover the entire face during contact with the patient is worth considering . \n\n references \n\n association between 2019-ncov transmission and n95 respirator use . \n\n comparison of performance of three different types of respiratory protection devices . \n\n protecting healthcare staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome : filtration capacity of multiple surgical masks . \n\n a close shave ? performance of p2/n95 respirators in health care workers with facial hair : results of the beards ( adequate respiratory defences ) study . \n\n effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza : a systematic review and meta-analysis . \n\n cloth masks versus medical masks for covid-19 . 
00001000	emergency trauma care during the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in china \n\n background \n\n a novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in wuhan , hubei province , in december 2019 ; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans . china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease . however , a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking . to regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak , we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in wuhan . \n\n main body \n\n the article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 , indications for emergency surgery , and infection prevention and control for medical personnel , providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period . \n\n conclusions \n\n the measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of covid-19 . \n\n background \n\n a novel corona virus disease ( covid-19 ) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) began in wuhan , hubei province , china , in december 2019 . by february 13 , 2020 , more than 60,000 cases were confirmed , nearly 50,000 in hubei alone , and the source of the infection was yet to be definitely determined . the world health organization ( who ) has declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) . considering the current rate of human to human transmission , most countries in the world should be well prepared for the potential global covid-19 pandemic . china is on the frontline in the fight against the virus , and medical staff have become exhausted due to the excessive workload brought on by the outbreak . medical testing tools and personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , such as face shields , goggles , and gloves , have become scarce and have had to be rationed among teams and medical centers , with severe shortage in hubei , the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak . a report from a neurosurgery department of a teaching hospital in wuhan showed that from december 25 , 2019 , to february 6 , 2020 , eight covid-19 suspected patients were admitted , and three were confirmed . consequently , 12 medical personnel were infected ( 11 nurses and one doctor ) , among whom three had been in close contact with the first confirmed case . according to the data released by the national health commission ( nhc ) of the people 's republic of china , a total of 1716 medical personnel infections had been reported nationwide , accounting for 3.8 % of the total confirmed cases by 24:00 on february 11 , 2020 , of which six ( 0.4 % ) had died . of these , hubei province reported 1502 cases , accounting for 87.5 % of the total medical personnel infections , while wuhan city reported 1102 cases , accounting for 73.4 % . notably , medical personnel are the most valuable resource during the outbreak . how to protect them from infection is one of the foremost challenges in the fight against sars-cov-2 . \n\n although china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of sars-cov-2 , severe trauma can still occur . during the outbreak , the population of trauma patients may be diverse in terms of infection status , including patients who were previously healthy , suspected to be infected , confirmed infected , close contacts of infected individuals , and asymptomatic carriers . thus , balancing optimal trauma care while preventing further spread of the viral infection during the outbreak is a major challenge . \n\n to our knowledge , there is no relevant consensus or clinical guideline available on the indications of , timing of or perioperative protection during emergency surgery for trauma . to protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of trauma care , we have summarized the recommended perioperative infection prevention and control measures for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 based on current practical experience in china and the published literature on surgical practice during the past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) , ebola virus , and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n main text \n\n general principles \n\n special requirements for the hospitals receiving trauma patients during the outbreak \n\n emergency department : set up a triage area for assessment of all patients at admission , allowing early recognition of possible sars-cov-2 infection and immediate isolation of patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection in an area separate from other patients . \n\n radiology department : a dedicated ct room should be kept on standby for the examination of infected patients . \n\n operating room ( or ) : a relatively isolated negative-pressure or is preferable ; if there is no permanent negative-pressure or , a temporarily modified negative-pressure or the main operating suite of the hospital can be converted . \n\n intensive care unit ( icu ) : an isolated area should be prepared in the icu , and suspected patients should be treated in a single space . \n\n intrahospital transport : although an ideal trauma center with a door-to-door ct room and negative-pressure or are preferable in this situation , most regions in china do not operate such facilities . therefore , a predetermined transport route should be used to minimize exposure , and any intrahospital transport should utilize dedicated carts demarcated by a warning logo equipped with protective supplies and hand disinfectants . the patient should wear a medical mask , and the walls and the floor of the passageways and the elevator should be covered with a plastic lining . \n\n to control the spread of covid-19 , basic principles for treating infectious diseases should be followed , and necessary measures should be taken before receiving trauma patients . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n precaution level applicable personnel and scenarios personal protective equipment level 1 triage , emergency department clean non-sterile long gown , disposable head cover , disposable medical mask , and gloves . level 2 close contact with suspected patients , or handling secretions , feces , and personal items belonging to patients ; performing ct scan ( fig . 1 ) disposable head cover , gloves , disposable coverall , n95 respirator or equivalent , goggle or face shield , rubber boots or fluid-resistant overshoes , etc . level 3 close contact with suspected patients , or collecting blood , respiratory tract samples of patients , especially for endotracheal intubation , airway care , and sputum suction , as well as emergency surgery ( fig . 2 ) . on the basis of wearing secondary protective equipment such as goggle or face shield , other protective equipment should be strengthened . for instance , adding disposable surgical clothing and gloves in addition to disposable coverall and gloves . two layers of gloves covering protective clothing and surgical clothes sleeves , respectively , use of a powered air purifying respirator ( papr ) . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n to standardize and simplify the precaution measures and equipment required for different personnel and scenarios in trauma care , we adopted a three-level precaution protocol in trauma care ( table 1 ) . \n\n all levels of precaution were based on implementing standard precautions , including hand hygiene , respiratory hygiene , and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment ( ppe ) according to different risk levels . proper training of the standard donning and doffing procedures is the basis of effective protection . in epidemic areas such as hubei province , all patients can be regarded as potentially suspected patients during the outbreak , and the level of the precaution should be elevated . \n\n triage \n\n classification of the patients suspected cases clinical confirmed cases ( hubei only ) pathogenic confirmed cases diagnostic basis outside hubei province : two of the clinical manifestations with at least one of the epidemiological histories , three of the clinical manifestations without epidemiological history suspected patient in hubei province with ct findings of pneumonia suspected or clinically confirmed patients with at least one pathogenic evidence epidemiological investigation 1 . travel to or residence in wuhan in the 14 days prior to symptom onset ; 2 . close contactb with sars-cov-2 infection ( rrt-pcr positive ) within 14 days before onset ; 3 . exposed to patients from wuhan and surrounding areas , or from a community with patients who reported fever or respiratory symptoms14 d before onset ; 4 . clustering outbreak . - - clinical manifestations and ct scan 1 . fever and/or respiratory symptoms ; 2 . imaging characteristics of covid-19 ( ct : multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes in early stage , which are obvious in the peripheral lung , and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs , and lung consolidation may occur in severe cases ) ; 3 . the total number of white blood cells in the early stage is normal or decreased , and the lymphocyte count is decreased - - pathogenic evidence null null 1 . detection of sars-cov-2 in respiratory specimens and sera by rrt-pcr assays ; 2 . by virus dna sequencing , respiratory or blood samples dna sequence highly homologous with sars-cov-2 . \n\n diagnostic criteria of covid-19a \n\n covid-19 coronavirus induced disease , sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 , rrt-pcr real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \n\n athe diagnostic criteria were defined according to guidance for the diagnosis and management for covid-19 ( 5th edition ) released by national health commission of people 's republic of china in feb. 4 , 2020 \n\n bclose contact is defined as follows : \n\n - healthcare-associated exposure , including providing direct care for covid-19 patients , working with healthcare workers infected with novel coronavirus , visiting patients , or staying in the same close environment as a covid-19 patient \n\n - working together in close proximity or sharing the same classroom environment with a covid-19 patient \n\n - traveling together with a covid-19 patient in any kind of conveyance \n\n - living in the same household as a covid-19 patient \n\n trauma patients during the outbreak should be managed using the relevant contents in table 2 , and they should complete a brief epidemiological investigation at the triage stage . however , the trauma patients ' history may be unreliable , as they may not have time to be detailed . more emphasis should be placed on the objective data . during the outbreak in wuhan , a total of 32 emergency operations were performed in a tertiary care hospital , including 19 suspected and seven pathogenic confirmed cases . in addition , nine covid-19 patients in another tertiary care hospital underwent gastrointestinal surgery , but in all of these patients , covid-19 was diagnosed postoperatively . it is worth noting that there have been many cases of asymptomatic patients with an incubation period . the maximum incubation period was reported to be 24 days . \n\n evaluation \n\n trauma care is highly time dependent and requires rapid and effective evaluation and management . during the outbreak , primary and secondary surveys should be completed while maintaining the premise of effective protection . \n\n general principles of evaluation \n\n dynamic evaluation strategies should be conducted throughout the trauma care process . the personal protective equipment ( ppe ) worn by medical personnel may result in limited or incomplete physical examinations ( such as palpation and auscultation ) . therefore , injury assessment may rely on radiological examinations . \n\n radiology evaluation \n\n a chest ct scan is recommended for all severe trauma patients if there is no contraindication . if the chest ct scan is not possible due to critical condition , the patient should be treated as a suspect for infection until infection is excluded . \n\n level 3 ppe during ct examination \n\n if the hospital has a trauma resuscitation unit , complete x-ray including but not limited to the chest and focused assessment with sonography for trauma ( fast ) in the trauma resuscitation unit should be performed . for hemodynamic stabilization , a ct scan including but not limited to the chest should be performed ( fig . 1 ) . if the hospital does not have a trauma resuscitation unit , patients with hemodynamic instability should be resuscitated in the emergency department and undergo fast simultaneously . once the hemodynamic status is stable enough , the ct scan should be performed as soon as possible . \n\n ct scan protocol for trauma patients suspected of having covid-19 : medical personnel should first determine the method and scope of the scan , including but not limited to the chest , according to the mechanism of injury . for stab wounds , the segment and body cavity near the wound should be examined . for gunshot wounds , due to the high kinetic energy of the projectiles , the tortuous wound path , and the heavy tissue damage , the scanning range should be expanded appropriately . patients who have sustained blunt injuries with high energy , such as traffic injuries , should usually be scanned with enhanced scanning ranging from head to mid-thigh ( including the whole lower limb when there is lower limb injury ) . enhanced scanning is helpful in providing further information on organ injury , and three-dimensional reconstruction of blood vessels and bone should be performed when major vascular and bone injury is suspected . \n\n ct features of covid-19 : it should be noted that the pulmonary imaging changes of covid-19 vary depending on the patient 's age , immunity status , stage of disease at the time of the scan , underlying disease , and drug intervention . reports have shown that in the early stage of infection , ct shows multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes , which are obvious in the peripheral lung and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs . in severe cases , lung consolidation could occur . in addition , special attention should be paid to discerning between covid-19 infection and pulmonary contusion . \n\n blood and pathogen specimen collection \n\n if possible , nasopharyngeal swabs , sputum , lower respiratory tract secretions , and blood samples should be collected and sent for rrt-pcr in the emergency period . if no respiratory tract specimens are collected before the operation due to time constraints , they can be collected during or after the operation . \n\n all specimens shall be deemed to be potentially infectious . collection , transportation , and processing of any clinical specimens should be performed by biological safety training qualified medical staff . level 3 precautions should be adopted to minimize the possibility of exposure . \n\n the results of rrt-pcr may be falsely negative due to the influence of sampling , transportation , extraction , and testing . recent observations have shown that 30 to 40 % of patients with covid-19 ct features were rrt-pcr negative . as a result , the protection standard can not be lowered due to negative results . since the rrt-pcr test can take several hours to confirm the diagnosis , chest ct is recommended as the basis for the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 in suspected patients , especially in areas with a high incidence of the disease . the use of chest ct not only helps to control the spread of the epidemic but can also ensure definitive care for trauma injuries in a timely manner . \n\n emergency surgery \n\n emergency surgery is of great importance for severe trauma patients , the aim of which includes hemorrhage control , contamination abatement , and compartment pressure relief as soon as possible . effective prevention of sars-cov-2 transmission by standard intraoperative protective measures is an important indicator of a successful operation . from the available evidence , sars-cov-2 is spread mainly through respiratory droplets and contact , while aerosol and fecal-oral transmission are still under investigation . from the existing evidence and our practical experience , all medical staff should adopt level 3 precautions when entering the or . \n\n or preparation \n\n an independent negative pressure operation room is the first choice . operations can only be performed when the pressure is between - 10 and - 5 pa . if a negative pressure or is not available , a relatively isolated or with an independent purification system is an alternative option . nevertheless , the purification system should be shut down during the operation , and a final disinfection should be performed postoperatively . as in standard trauma protocols , the more critical patient should be operated on first . if two or more suspected or confirmed infected patients arrive in the or , a 30-min disinfection is warranted before the subsequent operation . the dedicated or should be clearly marked as covid-19 exclusive . \n\n the dedicated covid-19 or should be designed with a special passage and elevator . the design should focus on shortening the outdoor distance , reducing the chance of human contact , and limiting the time spent in suspected contaminated areas . materials and equipment should only be delivered by specially assigned staff . people inside the or are not allowed to leave during the operation , and outdoor personnel should not enter without permission . surgical articles should be clearly identified , and the use of disposable items is recommended . to maintain pressure , surgical supplies ( surgical instruments , dressings , single-use consumables , high-value consumables , medications , and relevant items ) should be well prepared in advance . only unidirectional flow is permitted ( nothing should be taken out once it is entered during the operation ) . personnel movement and the frequency of door opening are strictly limited . nondisposable items should be disposed of postoperatively in strict accordance with regulations . two suction apparatuses are optimal , one of which is for exclusive use by the anesthesiologist . the negative pressure aspirator should be immediately placed on the patient 's face to minimize the spread of respiratory secretions after entering the operation room . \n\n ppe for operation personnel \n\n protective clothing for surgical personnel : a after wearing protective clothing and inner gloves , b after wearing operating clothes and outer gloves \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe donning \n\n the topic of intraoperative protection remains controversial because most surgeons have no experience performing surgery while wearing heavy and airproof contagion gowns and goggles . according to practice in china , some medical personnel wore two surgical gowns , two contagion gowns and four pairs of gloves for surgery during the covid-19 epidemic . instead of enhancing protective effects , such excessive protection can reduce the visual , auditory , and tactile sensitivity of the surgeon , thus reducing the precision of surgical operations ( fig . 2 ) . the influence of excessive protection on the surgeon mainly includes ( 1 ) difficulty breathing , ( 2 ) fog on goggles and face shields that interfere with vision , ( 3 ) constriction of visual fields , ( 4 ) loss of flexibility due to multiple layers of gloves , and ( 5 ) double or triple the duration of the operation . a practical lesson had been learned from the case of a 7-year-old girl with suspected covid-19 infection who was subjected to an urgent craniotomy due to obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a third ventricle germ cell-derived tumor . the surgical team adopted a level 3 precaution including n95 respirators or papr , and full coverage with protective gowns ( shoe covers included ) and sterile surgical gowns . consequently , an operation that would have taken 2-3 h ended up taking 10 h. possible solutions for reducing the impact of ppe on surgery include reducing the or temperature ( minimizing the formation of moisture on goggles ) and enhancing the lighting in the room to obtain better vision . all ppes are fit for single use except papr . the steps of donning and doffing should be completed under professional supervision ( fig . 3 ) . \n\n anesthesia \n\n regional nerve block is the first choice for limb surgeries . general anesthesia is recommended for neurosurgery , torso trauma , or multiple trauma with shock . \n\n attention should be paid to avoid aerosol generation caused by coughing and other causes in airway operations . intubation should be performed after rapid induction and full muscle relaxation to ensure complete disappearance of spontaneous breathing , and sputum aspiration before intubation should be avoided . remote endotracheal intubation by disposable glide scope with an assistant is recommended . awake endotracheal intubation is not recommended for patients with a difficult airway , hypoxia , or unconsciousness . if face mask or laryngeal mask ventilation is able to maintain oxygenation , multiple tools ( fiberoptic bronchoscope , glide scope , light stick , laryngeal mask ) can be used to assist endotracheal intubation after rapid induction of general anesthesia . if not , cricothyroid laryngotomy should be performed without any hesitation . rapid induction via oral intubation is recommended in cases of a possibly full stomach . mask positive pressure ventilation after administration should be avoided . no emetic measure is recommended . extra caution should be taken on when a nasogastric tube is in place . covid-19 can cause pulmonary inflammation that can induce added lung injury , restricted crystal fluid , and protective ventilation . the proper mechanical ventilation parameters include limited tidal volume ( < 8 ml/kg ) and airway pressure ( platform pressure < 30 cm h2o ) ; 5-10 cm h2o positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation ( peep ) is optional for alveoli expansion and oxygenation maintenance . permissive hypercapnia is also acceptable . \n\n surgical strategy \n\n the concept of damage control surgery should be followed to simplify the operation . it is optimal to finish an operation within 90 min , and strategies such as packing hemostasis , external fixation , and temporary abdominal closure are helpful to shorten the operation time . surgical personnel should be highly focused and closely coordinated . gentle movement is essential to avoid accidental injury and contamination caused by the spattering of blood , fluid , and bone debris . limiting rinsing and drainage of bodily fluids is another key to effectively reducing intraoperative contamination . reliable hemostasis should be maintained to prevent bleeding around the incision . excessive negative pressure suction and violent operations are prohibited . it is also suggested that electrotome use is not suitable under this scenario ; if it must be used , the power should be minimized . smoke should be quickly suctioned to avoid aerosol generation . \n\n postoperative management \n\n postoperative management of patients \n\n after the operation , the patient should be transferred to an isolation ward in the icu . the endotracheal tubes should be removed under analgesia to avoid violent coughing while the patient is stable . sputum aspiration should be performed by a closed suction system . trauma and surgery can impair the patient 's immune function . clinically , some asymptomatic covid-19 patients suffered rapid deterioration after surgery . surgeons and anesthesiologists should be aware that acute lung injury caused by covid-19 may exist preoperatively or worsen postoperatively . therefore , special attention should be paid to the monitoring of body temperature , infection , and hemodynamic index . reexamination of chest ct and rrt-pcr tests is also important . for postoperative trauma patients with fever , traumatic , or operative complications should also be considered to differentiate them from covid-19 . attention should be paid to symptomatic and etiological treatment . postoperative dyspnea and hypoxia should also be differentiated from complications such as pulmonary embolism . nutritional support and prevention of other complications ( bacterial infection , stress ulcer , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , and deep venous thrombosis ) should also be strengthened . \n\n quarantine \n\n based on current experience , if the medical personnel complete the operation successfully and comply with all the regulations without any accidental exposure , the patient does not need to be quarantined . otherwise , a 14-day medical observation is obligatory , and timely treatment is needed when any abnormalities occur . notably , some literature recommends a routine 14-day quarantine for relevant personnel involved in the operation for sars-cov-2 confirmed patients . however , extreme safety often results in severe incapacity to help patients , so a balance between safety and efficiency must be maintained . \n\n discussion \n\n the national health commission of china initially decided to temporarily call the disease novel coronavirus pneumonia or ncp . it was not until february 12 , 2020 , that the official name covid-19 was announced by the who . shortly after the who announced the disease 's official name , the virus causing it was named sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , highlighting the new virus 's similarity to the sars virus identified in 2003 . based on epidemiological data up to jan. 4 , 2020 , the estimated r0 was 2.2 ( 95 % ci , 1.4 to 3.9 ) , while the latest study surveying cases up to feb. 14 , 2020 , further calculated that the r0 of covid-19 was 3.77 . therefore , researchers estimated that in terms of infection ability , sars-cov-2 was slightly higher than the sars virus and significantly higher than the mers-cov . according to clinical characteristic analysis of sars-cov-2 infection in china , the mortality was 2.01 % out of 28,018 cases as of feb. 6 , 2020 . by human-to-human transmission , sars-cov-2 had spread rapidly from wuhan , china , to 24 other countries as of feb. 12 , 2020 . the number of cases within china and other countries is rapidly increasing , and it is estimated that for every additional 10 % decrease in transmission rate , the peak population will be reduced by 20-47 % . the cumulative number of infected cases and deaths will be reduced by 23-49 % due to comprehensive interventions . if current interventions continue , it is expected that the number of people infected will peak in early march 2020 . based on the epidemiological analysis , only 1.18 % of the patients had direct contact with wild animals , 31.30 % of the patients had been in wuhan , and 71.80 % of the patients had contact with people from wuhan . common symptoms included fever , cough , and diarrhea . a total of 76.4 % of patients had radiologic findings manifested as pneumonia , with the remaining patients exhibiting normal radiologic findings . poor clinical outcomes can be predicted by disease severity , including oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count , and chest ct manifestations . \n\n the transmission by aerosols is still under investigation . aerosols are solid , liquid , solid , and liquid granular substances suspended in the air , such as dust , smoke , fog , and microorganisms . these may be the `` flying vehicles '' for covid-19 . covid-19 aerosols are related to the increased risk of covid-19 transmission . tracheal intubation , noninvasive ventilation , tracheotomy , manual ventilation before intubation , bronchoscopy , cardiopulmonary resuscitation , sputum suction , and other airway operations , as well as the use of electrotome , suction , and drainage , all inevitably produce a large number of aerosols . when carrying out these operations , the protection and training of medical personnel should be strengthened , and preventive measures to protect against aerosols are recommended , including n95 respirators , papr , goggles or face shields , disposable fluid-resistant gowns , and limiting the number of people in the room . \n\n based on experience from the hospital in wuhan , patients with covid-19 have high mortality after surgery . as of february 14 , 2020 , 6 gastrointestinal operations were performed in the general surgery department of the authors ' hospital ; one 60-year-old male died of respiratory failure 14 days after surgery , and one died of septic shock , for a mortality rate of 33.33 % . another group of eight covid-19 confirmed patients in zhongnan hospital of wuhan university underwent gastrointestinal surgeries ( seven gastrointestinal tumors and one benign case ) ; one patient died of covid-19 after left hemicolectomy with the diagnosis of postoperative recurrence of renal cancer involving the descending colon with intestinal obstruction , and one tumor patient died from postoperative complications of abdominal infection , for a mortality rate of 25 % . trauma patients usually have massive hemorrhage , shock , and contamination . damage control strategies should be complied with to correct fatal triads caused by hypothermia , acidosis , and coagulopathy . meanwhile , effective oxygen therapy and organ function support are also indispensable . \n\n moreover , additional attention should be paid to patients in critical condition and to those who develop severe pneumonia after trauma . among covid-19 patients , critical patients , including patients with respiratory failure , septic shock , and other organ failures , have accounted for 29 % ~32 % . identifying high-risk groups with severe illness can also help reduce the occurrence of poor prognosis . the possible high-risk groups include patients over 65 years old , patients with obesity , and patients with other diseases ( such as chronic pulmonary disease , hypertension , heart disease , kidney disease , diabetes , tumor , and immune deficiency ) . \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe doffing \n\n the covid-19 outbreak poses significant challenges to hospital staff and specifically trauma surgeons , which must offer optimal and timely care despite the circumstances . strict safety protocols must be adhered to when carrying out emergency care for patients with severe trauma and other surgical diseases , which means that all the measures shall be carried out to preserve the ability of the medical staff to achieve the purpose of effective care without sacrificing the safety of all involved . the perspectives in this paper can not be a substitute for clinical judgment and expert consultation but can help provide up-to-date guidance on the clinical management of emergency surgery for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 ( fig . 4 ) . \n\n conclusion \n\n in conclusion , the covid-19 outbreak raises several issues concerning the safety of medical personnel and patients . areas with high incidence rates of covid-19 should conduct operations with caution and protection should be strengthened while ensuring suitable facilities to carry out optimal care with maximal safety . with the accumulation of clinical experience and in-depth research , some of the practices may require modification when additional

00001000	applications of 3d printing technology to address covid-19 related supply shortages \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) was first identified in an outbreak in wuhan , china on december 8 , 2019 . globally , the number of affected covid-19 patients is growing exponentially , with the death toll exceeding 27,300 as of march 27 , 2020 . worldwide , there is a limited supply of n95 respirator masks , face shields , ventilator valves , testing kits and other personal protective equipment . thus , adequate production and distribution of personal protective equipment is critical during this pandemic . to address these shortages , three-dimensional ( 3d ) printing , a novel and innovative technology used to fabricate complex architectures , is well suited . 3d printing is an adjustable , robotic platform allowing for tailored deposition of biomaterials using computer-aided design systems to formulate layer-by-layer custom designs with controlled architecture and composition . \n\n masks \n\n n95 respirators masks have two advantages over surgical , paper or cloth masks : 1 ) they are > 95 % efficient at filtering 0.3-microm airborne particles and 2 ) they are fit tested to each user to ensure an adequate seal , such that air and small droplets do not enter around the edges of the mask and into the health care worker 's breathing zone . the centers for disease control and prevention recommends n95 masks for health care workers taking care of patients with covid-19 . \n\n 3d printing can be used to produce tailored seal designs for improving mask comfort and fit . to customize face mask seals , 3d laser scanning can be implemented to scan exact facial parameters , with a tailored and customized face seal n95 template . anthropometric data of the chin arc , jawline , face and nose lengths , and nose protrusion measurements can be taken into account with this customized seal . in a study using face seal prototypes with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic using a fused deposition modeling 3d printer , three subjects showed improved contact pressure compared with use of 3m 8210 n95 ffr respirator masks . moreover , a personalized mask may account for facial hair length and density for a more precise fit . \n\n displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . the biomaterials displayed in this image have been fully characterized in the medical literature , with the same material composition of n95 masks . the mask includes several layers thereby ensure effective filtration of viral particles . \n\n figure 1 \n\n standard n95 masks consist of filtration material composed of electrostatic non-woven polypropylene ( pp ) fibers which are semi-rigid , lightweight and fatigue resistant . the semi-crystalline structure may cause significant distortion of the 3d printed parts upon cooling thereby making 3d printing difficult . material extrusion 3d printing was used to design a 3d printable thermoplastic elastomeric material from a blend of polypropylene ( pp ) and styrene- ( ethylene-butylene ) -styrene ( sebs ) . this blend provides better printability and flexibility for n95 mask design . pp is commonly used for various industrial applications due to its low cost , processability , printability , recyclability and mechanical integrity . sebs is a polymeric elastomer with low processing temperature and low distortion during extrusion . thus , the pp/sebs combination would improve the processability of 3d printed n95 masks . moreover , controlling the thermoplastic elastomer ratio allows for tailoring the flexibility and elasticity of the 3d model material for better fitted masks . 3d melt electrospinning printing can also be used to create pp microfibers with sequential layering to accurately obtain a 3d form . thus , 3d printing procedures may allow for the creation of stable and biocompatible n95 masks that are comparable to industrial manufacturing brands . figure 1 displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . \n\n face shields \n\n polycarbonate and polyester , polyvinyl chloride and other synthetic polymers are commonly used to make surgical face shields . these biomaterials are transparent , lightweight and provide high optical clarity . the polymers can easily be printed using 3d technology to meet the needs of healthcare workers treating covid-19 . \n\n covid-19 specimen collection kit \n\n creating 3d printed test swabs would help increase covid-19 testing capacity . nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs can be made from a flexible polymer , using polystyrene for the shaft . the tip can be tailored to be micro fine using computer-aided design software . thereafter , swab bud lattice fibers can be made from calcium alginate using hydrogels using 3d tissue engineering . \n\n ventilator valves \n\n ventilator valves are attachments used to deliver oxygen at fixed concentrations for patients with acute respiratory distress , including covid-19 patients . 3d printing technology can be used via a filament extrusion system or a polymer-laser powder bed fusion process to print single-use valve sets . 3d printers can design the different elements of the valve using biomaterials such as polyamide and polysulfone , polycarbonate , silicone rubber and stainless steel . furthermore , these disposable valves eliminate time-consuming sterilization . \n\n medications \n\n 3d printing techniques , such as fused filament , inkjet , extrusion and powder extrusion , allow for fabrication of 3d printed pills . medication-printing technologies typically utilize a small nozzle to lay thin disc-shaped layers of powders and deposit microscopic droplets of liquid to bind the materials . a coaxial needle extrusion 3d technology was used to print active pharmaceutical ingredients and create combinations of controlled dosing of drugs . while there are no specific antivirals or vaccines for treatment of covid-19 , several well-characterized anti-viral drugs are being considered as therapies . it may be possible to use 3d medication-printing technology to effectively and rapidly print lopinavir/ritonavir , chloroquine , and hydroxychloroquine pills . thus , 3d technology has the potential to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry , making drug research , development and production applicable to covid-19 patients . \n\n as the covid-19 outbreak rapidly evolves , there has been a personal protective equipment shortage globally . 3d printing inventions can be rapidly applied to address these deficiencies . cost , processing time , testing , and manpower are potential barriers to creating 3d-printed personal protective equipment . however , the synthetic polymer biomaterials needed for 3d-printed personal protective equipment are exact or very similar in composition to the standard manufacturing grade products ( i.e . n95 masks provides the same fluid barrier and air filtration protection ) . moreover , these synthetic polymer materials are readily available and cost effective ( i.e . polypropylene is 12.47 cents per pound ) . 3d printer costs vary but are an excellent investment with labor performed via robotics . in conjunction with flattening the curve via social distancing , this pioneering technology can provide adequate personal protective equipment for health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic . \n\n abbreviations : \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) \n\n three-dimensional ( 3d ) \n\n polypropylene ( pp ) \n\n

00010010	transmission potential of the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) onboard the diamond princess cruises ship , 2020 \n\n an outbreak of covid-19 developed aboard the princess cruises ship during january-february 2020 . using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members , we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak . our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore ( approximate range : 1.1-7 ) . our findings suggest that rt decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control . most recent estimates of rt reached values largely below the epidemic threshold , indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n introduction \n\n while the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) spread rapidly throughout china for several weeks since december 2019 , the virus had not taken off outside china in part due to the unprecedented social distancing measures that the chinese government put in place . one exception is the outbreak of covid-19 that developed aboard the diamond princess ship which was detected in early february when one of its passengers , a traveler from hong kong , tested positive for the novel coronavirus . the number of cases in the diamond princess ship quickly jumped to 454 confirmed cases by february 18 , 2020 . in contrast , the total number of cases in singapore , one of the countries with the highest number of covid-19 cases after china , was only 77 at the time . \n\n accumulating evidence indicates that the novel coronavirus can spread widely in confined settings including hospitals , cruise ships , prisons , and churches . in wuhan city , china , outbreaks inside health care settings led to the infection of hundreds of health professionals . in tokyo , japan , most of the reported infections have been linked to a party inside a traditional wooden ship , called yakatabune while most of the infections in korea have affected members of one church and one hospital . \n\n tracking the evolution of the transmission potential of covid-19 in different confined settings and how it compares with that of other respiratory diseases such influenza has public health implications . when outbreaks occur in confined settings , it is useful to investigate how the effective reproduction number changes as a result of interventions strategies such as the quarantine that the japanese government imposed on travelers and crew members aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n in this study we sought to characterize the temporal variation in the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak aboard the princess cruises ship using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data by dates of symptoms onset describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members . \n\n epidemiological incidence cases \n\n in yokohama , japan , an outbreak of covid-19 has been unfolding on board the princess cruise ship , which has been under quarantine orders since february 5 , 2020 , after a former passenger of the diamond princess ship tested positive for the virus after disembarking in hong kong . as of february 22 , 2020 , two days after the scheduled two-week quarantine came to an end , a total of 621 symptomatic and asymptomatic people including one quarantine officer , one nurse and one administrative officer tested positive for covid-19 out of the 3711 passengers and crew members on board . laboratory tests by pcr that prioritize symptomatic or high-risk groups have been conducted . \n\n incidence curves of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases of covid-19 among passengers and crew members of the outbreak unfolding aboard the princess cruises ship are publicly available from the national institute of infectious diseases , japan ( niid ) website . daily time series of symptomatic patients , from january 20 , 2020 to february 18 , 2020 were extracted . however , to reconstruct the trajectory of the epidemic , only 197 cases have dates of symptoms onset are available out of a total of 300 confirmed symptomatic cases . \n\n of the 103 symptomatic cases with missing onset dates , a total of the 79 cases are passengers while 24 cases are crew members . moreover , out of the 79 passenger cases , 30 cases were reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 21 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 28 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . of 24 crew member cases , 1 case was reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 15 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 8 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . \n\n epidemiological modeling \n\n we connected the daily incidence series with a discrete-time integral equation to describe the epidemic dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . specifically , let fs denote the probability mass function of the serial interval of covid-19 , where the serial interval is defined as the time from illness onset in the primary case to time of illness onset in the secondary case . then fs , of length s days , is given by \n\n for s > 0 , f ( s ) represents the cumulative distribution function of the gamma distribution . we characterized the expected number of new incident cases e [ ci , t ] in type i at symptom onset week t as follows , where rij denotes the average number of cases of type i infected by a single individual of type j . here we assume that the incidence , ci , t , follows a poisson sampling process with expected value e [ ci , t ] . \n\n the reproduction matrix for each type is given by \n\n this matrix is referred to as a next-generation matrix ( ngm ) in a fully susceptible population ( , pp . 873-885 ) . using this matrix , we derive the instantaneous time-dependent effective reproduction number , rt , for the entire transmission dynamics from the largest eigenvalue of the ngm . under the assumption that the per-contact infection probability and the generation interval are consistent over time regardless of the type of infection , the ngm quantifies the within type and inter-type patterns of transmission . the sum of the value in column j is the reproduction number for a specific type j . \n\n serial interval estimates of covid-19 were derived from previous studies of covid-19 , indicating that it follows a gamma distribution with the mean and sd at 7.5 and 3.4 days , respectively , based on ref .. the maximum value of the serial interval was fixed at 20 days as the cumulative probability distribution of the gamma distribution up to 20 days reaches 0.991 . \n\n we estimated model parameters and made projections using a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) method in a bayesian framework . point estimates and corresponding 95 % credibility intervals were drawn from the posterior probability distribution . all statistical analyses were conducted in r version 3.5.2 ( r foundation for statistical computing , vienna , austria ) and the 'rstan ' package ( no-u-turn-sampler ( nuts ) ) ( see table 1 ) . \n\n result \n\n day date event 1 jan/20/2020 departed from the

across transmission types : 5.6 ( 95 % cri : 0.3 , 10.9 ) for passenger to passenger , 0.6 ( 95 % cri : 0.1 , 1.1 ) for passenger to crew , 0.5 ( 95 % cri : 0.2 , 0.8 ) for crew to passenger , 0.5 ( 95 % cri : 0.3 , 0.8 ) for crew to crew . although vaccines are still in early development stages as of february 2020 , based on our findings , the corresponding target vaccination coverage to contain the outbreak in this confined setting were estimated at 91 % and 94 % from the maximum value of the 50 percentile distribution and the 97.5 percentile distribution , respectively . \n\n range

of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 . passenger and crew also have total ( within-type and inter-type ) rt values largely below the epidemic threshold , with only small percentages at 0 % and 9 % above the epidemic threshold , respectively ( table 3 ) . \n\n discussion \n\n this is the first study to assess the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak that unfolded aboard the diamond princess ship , january-february 2020 . the overall mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore in the range 1.1-7 . however , following the implementation of the quarantine period , the overall rt decreased substantially compared to values estimated during the early stage , but it exhibited fluctuations around the epidemic threshold , which likely prolonged the outbreak . \n\n our results indicate that rt declined following the quarantine measures implemented by the japanese government on february 5 relative to values during the early phase of the outbreak . importantly , only those passengers and crew who tested positive for the novel coronavirus were permitted to disembark the diamond princess ship , with more than 80 percentage of the passengers and crews still on board as of february 18 , 2020 . our latest overall estimate of rt at 0.35 ( 95 % cri : 0.02 , 2.19 ) with only 2 % of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 suggested a low probability of observing a subsequent outbreak aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n our findings indicate that the passenger-to-passenger transmission type dominated the transmission dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . the rapid increase in the overall rt from day 12 ( january 31 , 2020 ) to day 19 ( february 7 , 2020 ) is greatly influenced by the increase in passenger-to-passenger transmission , and this time period covers the time lag between february 1 , 2020 when the index covid-19 case was reported and february 5 , 2020 when the japanese government requested the passengers to stay inside their cabin after the detection of a cluster of covid-19 positive cases . upon the implementation of the quarantine orders , the overall rt and rt for passengers aboard the diamond princess ship declined thereafter , while rt among crew maintained a steady level and only started to decline on day 25 of the outbreak ( february 13 , 2020 ) . this is consistent with the fact that passengers staying inside their cabins led to a substantial decline in passenger-to-passenger transmission type except for their interaction with cabin mates . indeed , the proportion of secondary infections inside the cabins increased from 7 % ( 1/15 ) on february 6 , 43 % ( 3/7 ) on february 10 , 2020 to 100 % ( 1/1 ) on february 14 , 2020 . thus , a high proportion of the symptomatic cases after the quarantine gradually shifted from largely passenger cases to crew cases . indeed , despite their potential risk of acquiring the infection , crews had to continue to work to deliver services to isolated passengers . the distribution of the median re by transmission type suggests that other transmission types likely contributed to this outbreak to some extent ( fig . 3 ) . because one quarantine officer , one nurse , and one administrative officer contracted covid-19 aboard the diamond princess ship , the infection risk continued to be significant inside the diamond princess ship . \n\n as for the crude asymptomatic ratios by age groups , they show significant differences across age groups . however , these crude ratios are severely influenced by the timing of specimen collection relative to the infection time . hence , these ratios could be better ascertained if additional data with the timing of specimen collection becomes available . \n\n several limitations should be listed . first , a total of 103 laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases with unknown onset dates were not incorporated in our analysis . although the high proportion of unavailable data ( 34 % ( 103/300 ) ) likely influenced a downward bias in estimates of transmission potential , our estimates still point to the high transmission potential of covid-19 inside confined settings . second , it is possible that reporting delays could have influenced our latest estimates of the effective reproduction number . in fact , the us government recently sent a chartered flight to transport the american passengers on board the diamond princess ship , and after the disembarkation process , a total of 14 american passengers tested positive for the disease on february 16 , 2020 . this event also contributes to a downward bias in r although the number of cases does not exceed the peak of the outbreak , further supporting the potent transmissibility of covid-19 in confined settings . \n\n our most recent estimate of the effective reproduction number of the ongoing covid-19 epidemic on board the diamond princess ship was largely below the epidemic threshold of 1.0 , which suggested a very low probability of observing secondary outbreaks of the disease in the diamond princess ship . \n\n funding statement \n\n km acknowledges support from the japan society for the promotion of science kakenhi grant number 18k17368 and from

00000100	asymptomatic and human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 in a 2-family cluster , xuzhou , china . \n\n we report epidemiologic , laboratory , and clinical findings for 7 patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease in a 2-family cluster . our study confirms asymptomatic and human-to-human transmission through close contacts in familial and hospital settings . these findings might also serve as a practical reference for clinical diagnosis and medical treatment . 
00001000	contact transmission of covid-19 in south korea : novel investigation techniques for tracing contacts \n\n in the epidemiological investigation of an infectious disease , investigating , classifying , tracking , and managing contacts by identifying the patient 's route are important for preventing further transmission of the disease . however , omissions and errors in previous activities can occur when the investigation is performed through only a proxy interview with the patient . to overcome these limitations , methods that can objectively verify the patient 's claims ( medical facility records , global positioning system , card transactions , and closed-circuit television ) were used for the recent ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 contact investigations in south korea . \n\n introduction \n\n an epidemiological investigation aims to quickly determine the prevalence of an infectious disease whilst simultaneously revealing the cause , and source of the disease , and explore the transmission process to ultimately prevent the spread of the infectious disease . as individuals become the source of the infectious disease , and if person-to-person transmission is suspected , it is important to immediately identify , and manage people that are in close contact with suspected patients . in particular , if there are several unknown epidemiological and clinical characteristics , and an effective medical intervention is lacking ( as in the case of new infectious diseases such as covid-19 ) , contact management becomes 1 of the core strategies to minimize additional transmission . for these strategies to be successful , it is necessary to evaluate between-person exposure risk in all locations where there have been confirmed cases ( after the onset of symptoms ) , and to classify contact persons based on this risk . furthermore , it is also important to eliminate the possibility of exposure to infection in the places visited by the confirmed patient , by performing the appropriate disinfection of areas that can harbor environmental contamination . however , traditional investigative methods , depending on the patient or proxy interview , has the limitation of omissions and errors of previous activities . \n\n the covid-19 outbreak in china occurred on december 8th , 2019 , and the first case in korea was reported on january 20th , 2020 . as of february 14th , the total number of confirmed cases of covid-19 in korea was 28 . in the current epidemiological investigation contact investigation techniques that were used on a limited basis for the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) outbreak in 2015 , are being used in all confirmed cases of covid-19 . \n\n this report will provide a general overview of the contact investigation from the covid-19 national emergency response center , epidemiology and case management team and describe the various methods used to evaluate exposure risk . \n\n results \n\n covid-19 contact investigation and management comprised of the following : 1 ) determination of the location of the contact ( patient route ) , 2 ) exposure risk evaluation , 3 ) contact classification , and 4 ) contact management . the location of the contact was determined through the process of preliminary identification , by interviewing patients , and their acquaintances , and by objective verification of the investigated information . exposure risk evaluation was performed depending on the route of disease transmission , patient characteristics , and environmental characteristics . based on the results of the evaluation , the contacts were classified into close and casual contacts depending on the exposure . the method of managing the classified contacts was largely distinguished between movement restriction and symptom monitoring . movement restriction is a legal public health order , and quarantine ( isolation ) , home isolation , or controlled travel is enacted . symptom monitoring was performed as either active or passive monitoring , depending on the exposure risk ( figure 1 ) . \n\n the methods used to overcome recall and confirmation biases that can occur while determining the location of the contact include checking medical facilities records , phone-based global positioning system ( gps ) , card transaction records , and closed-circuit television ( cctv ; table 1 ) . \n\n 1 . history of using medical facilities and visiting pharmacies \n\n history of using medical facilities , and visiting pharmacies was used to estimate the window of time of infection , through an accurate evaluation of the clinical symptoms of the infectious disease , and initial onset of the symptoms . if a medical facility was included in the patient 's route , quarantine of the medical facility was conducted . \n\n 2 . gps \n\n consistency in the recall of the route of the patients identified through interview was evaluated . additionally , identification of the routes that the patient could not remember was also possible . however , another person 's information can be misunderstood as the patient 's information if the phone is not owned by or carried by the patient . gps uses cellular phone networks , therefore there are limitations in identifying the exact locations of a patient 's route . \n\n 3. credit card transaction log \n\n credit card transaction logs were used to assess the consistency in the route of the patient identified through interview , and the scope of contacts was assessed by specifying the locations visited . however , if the patient did not use a credit card under their name or if another person used the patient 's card , the information may be misinterpreted . thus , rechecking the contents of the credit card log was necessary , and instances of not being able to use the information at the appropriate time may occur . \n\n 4 . cctv \n\n by checking the video footage of the location of a patient 's path , cctv provided help to identify the details of each situation . for example , cctv was used to evaluate the level of exposure risk by identifying whether the patient wore masks , or had respiratory symptoms such as a cough . the limitations of using cctv were the lengthy time required to check the cctv , and the accuracy of patient identification if the cctv was not inside the facility or the patient was in a blind spot of the camera . \n\n discussion \n\n based on the experience of the mers outbreak in 2015 , laws were revised to supplement the areas that were lacking at the time . korea centers for disease control and prevention were able to use relevant information in epidemiological investigations to contain and prevent infection , thus enabling the establishment of a more comprehensive management of infectious diseases . furthermore , making accurate information available to the general public helps to minimize fear and confusion with respect to the risk of transmissibility of the disease . the use of methods that have objectively verified the patient 's route claims ( medical facility records , gps , card transactions , and cctv ) for covid-19 contact investigations in south korea has provided accurate information on the location , and time of exposure , and details of the situation , thus reducing omissions in a patient 's route due to recall or confirmation bias that may have arisen from patient or proxy interviews . \n\n however , the publicization of a patient 's route for the public 's benefit infringes upon the privacy of the patient . thus , it is necessary to establish a protocol to protect privacy . equally , more effort should be taken to provide accurate information to the public . patient information that is unrelated to the communication of risk of infectious diseases must be protected by clearly defining the standards of publicization and reporting of patient information for the public 's benefit when an infectious disease is prevalent . \n\n with regards to responding to the recent prevalence of covid-19 , korea centers for disease control and prevention are performing defense activities to contain and prevent infection at the appropriate time , with more objective and accurate methods for monitoring patient contacts by using personal information . however , an evaluation of the effectiveness of these monitoring methods when multiple patients are involved , is necessary after the situation has been controlled . epidemiological investigations require the collaboration of various related persons and must be conducted through a strict verification process . furthermore , investigations must be performed using systematic processes with scientific methods and principles , and cycles of continuous evaluation and feedback to identify the etiology , extent , progression and therapy for the infectious disease and the development of public health policies . \n\n conflicts of interest \n\n the authors declare no competing

00001000	strategic planning to augment the testing capacity for covid-19 in india . \n\n background & objectives : nearly 5,500 tests for coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) had been conducted on march 31 , 2020 across the indian council of medical research ( icmr ) -approved public and private laboratories in india . given the need to rapidly increase testing coverage , we undertook an exercise to explore and quantify interventions to increase the daily real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qrt-pcr ) -based testing capacity over the next few months . the objective of this exercise was to prepare a potential plan to scale-up covid-19 testing in india in the public sector . methods : potential increase in daily testing capacity of the existing public laboratories was calculated across the three base scenarios of shifts ( 9 , 16 and 24 h ) . additional testing capacity was added for each shift scenario based on interventions ranging from procurement of additional qrt-pcr machines , leveraging spare capacity on available qrt-pcr machines not drafted into covid-19 testing , to in-laboratory process optimization efforts . results : moving to a 24 h working model in the existing approved laboratories can enhance the daily testing capacity to 40,464 tests/day . the capacity can be further bolstered by leveraging qrt-pcr and nucleic acid amplification test ( naat ) -based machines available with the multidisciplinary research units ( mrus ) , national aids control organisation ( naco ) and national tuberculosis elimination programme ( ntep ) . using combination/multiplex kits , and provision of automated rna extraction platforms at all laboratories could also optimize run time and contribute to capacity increase by 1.5-2 times . interpretation & conclusions : adopting these interventions could help increase public sector 's daily testing capacity to nearly 100,000-120,000 tests/day . it is important to note that utilization of the scaled-up testing capacity will require deployment of additional workforce , procurement of corresponding commodities for testing and scale-up of sample collection and transportation efforts . 
01100000	using integrated computational approaches to identify safe and rapid treatment for sars-cov-2 \n\n abstract \n\n sars-cov-2 is a new generation of coronavirus , which was first determined in wuhan , china , in december 2019 . so far , however , there no effective treatment has been found to stop this new generation of coronavirus but discovering of the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 main protease ( sars-cov-2 mpro ) may facilitate searching for new therapies for sars-cov-2 . the aim was to assess the effectiveness of available fda approved drugs which can construct a covalent bond with cys145 inside binding site sars-cov-2 main protease by using covalent docking screening . we conducted the covdock module mmgbsa module in the schrodinger suite 2020-1 , to examine the covalent bonding utilizing . besides , we submitted the top three drugs to molecular dynamics simulations via gromacs 2018.1 . the covalent docking showed that saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir and prevacid have the highest binding energies mmgbsa of -72.17 , -72.02 , -65.19 , -57.65 , -54.25 , -51.8 , and -51.14 kcal/mol , respectively . the 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation was conducted for saquinavir , ritonavir and remdesivir to evaluate the stability of these drugs inside the binding pocket of sars-cov-2 main protease . the current study provides a powerful in silico results , means for rapid screening of drugs as anti-protease medications and recommend that the above-mentioned drugs can be used in the treatment of sars-cov-2 in combined or sole therapy . \n\n communicated by ramaswamy h. sarma \n\n introduction \n\n sars-cov-2 also called 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ' abbreviated sars-cov-2 was recognized to be the causative of atypical pneumonia ( joshi , ; pant et al. , ) outbreak in wuhan , china ( hasan , ; s. a. khan et al. , 2020 ) . the virus belongs to the family known as 'coronaviruses ' because of the crown-like appearance of spikes glycoproteins on the envelope under an electron microscope ( y chen et al. , ) . world health organization ( who ) recently announced that the virus transforms from epidemic to pandemic , which requires urgent intervention to prevent the growing spread of the virus across the globe ( chan et al. , ) . the total confirmed cases 2,347,884 with 738,923 cases in the united state of america ( usa ) alone and the total death of 161,138 ( as of april 19 ) , with mortality estimated within 2 % and about 3.4 % , according to estimates of approved cases and death worldwide ( n. chen et al. , ) . the most familiar is a virus that arose from the rhinolophus bat which is > 96 % homologous with the modern sars-cov-2 virus and it is just 79 % homologous with the initial sars-cov ( fisher & heymann , ) . the fast-growing number of infected cases globally urged the world health organization to announce a state of global health emergency to correlate scientific and medical disciplines to develop rapidly an effective treatment for patients , ( morse et al. , ; sarma et al. , ) elderly patients and people with severe underlying health diseases like heart diseases , lung illness , and diabetic patients , for instance , appear to be at greater risk of revealing severe sars-cov-2 requires immediate intervention rather than waiting virus vaccine which may require 1 year to be available ( enayatkhani , ) . while drug repurposing could be a short-term and fast resolution to handle sars-cov-2 patients ( elfiky , ; r. j. khan et al. , 2020 ; kumar et al. , ) , repurposing existing drugs can offer a good choice to overcome the virus and offer better risk-versus trade-off as compared with discovering new drug and can help overcome time waiting for new therapy rather than use the available resources ( elmezayen , ; muralidharan , ) one successful repurposing drug story includes duloxetine which originally developed for depression and fda approved as the first-in-class choice for stress urinary incontinence ( sweeney & chancellor , ) , duloxetine initially created as antidepressant also is now passed to phase iii clinical trials as a first-in-class treatment for premature ejaculation ( mcmahon , ) and thalidomide , which had a tragic start as an over-the-counter sedative for morning sickness in pregnancy is now being applied to manage leprosy and multiple myeloma ( hideshima & anderson , ) . \n\n as a result of , a newly issued x-ray crystal of sars-cov-2 main protein ( mpro ) , we planning to use computational approaches ( cameron et al. , 2013 ) to contribute to find an effective treatment for sars-cov-2.thereby , computational analyses speed up these approaches since they allow to handle millions of data simultaneously ( gupta et al. , 2020 ) . molecular docking includes a set of computational methods and algorithms that aimed to identify novel relationships between chemical ligands and targets through using the modelling of their direct physical interaction ( aanouz , ; ekins et al. , ) . in present study , we attend to evaluate some of approved drugs to be as covalent binders , irreversible interactions , which can provide a powerful strategy to fight against epidemic viruses . and molecular dynamics simulations can give a more detail for the image which got from molecular covalent docking . \n\n materials and methods \n\n covalent virtual screening \n\n the crystal structure of fda-available covalent drugs which available in table 1 were selected based on the review of kumalo et al . and some of the antiviral drugs that can form a covalent bond to the target protein . and we aim also here to redirect them for other indications specially to see their possibility to fight against sars-cov-2 . thence , we searched about the chosen drugs in pubchem ( https : //pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) to identify the possibility of the selected drugs to be as covalent binders toward sars-cov-2 mpro . where , pubchem provides detailed information about the selected drugs rather than other repositories , especially , the property of drug to form covalent bond . before starting covalent docking , we downloaded the selected drugs one by one and optimize them by using the ligprep ( lim et al. , ) based on the opls_2005 force field and generated possible state employing epik in the schrodinger 2020 ( elfiky ; s. a. khan et al.,2020 ) . in the next step , the structure of sars-cov-2 mpro ( 6lu7 ) was downloaded from protein data bank ( http : //www.rcsb.org/pdb ) ( jin et al . , ) . the protease structure was optimized by adding hydrogens , removing water molecules and optimizing charge using the protein preparation wizard module ( kumalo et al. , ) in schrodinger suite 2020-1 . the covalent docking protocol was preferred since the cysteine 145 residue which is available in the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro considered as a vital residue that can form a covalent bond with the drug if it can interact covalently . the different mechanisms for the cys145-fda drug were mentioned in table 1 based on the nature of the drug so that the reactive functional group on the ligand and receptor residue are identified and the bond is formed between the correct atoms . these covalently docked complexes were created using covdock in schrodinger suite 2020-1 . finally , we selected the lowest the mmgbsa value for each drug as a propriate conformation of the drug inside the binding pocket . \n\n entry name pubchem id molecular

docking results showing type of based reaction for constructing covalent bond , docking score , glide score and rmsd . \n\n prime mm-gbsa \n\n the chosen drugs binding energies were calculated using prime mm-gbsa modules ( vijayakumar et al. , ) in the schrodinger ( 2020 ) . the best poses of selected drugs : sars-cov-2 mpro : were chosen to obtain the binding free energy calculation . prime mmgbsa is a method that combines optimized potential for liquid simulations-all atoms ( oplsaa ) force field , molecular mechanics energies ( emm ) , an sgb solvation model for polar solvation ( gsgb ) , and a non-polar solvation term ( gnp ) composed of the non-polar solvent accessible surface area and van der waals interactions . the total binding free energy : delta gbind = gcomplex - ( g-protein + gligand ) . \n\n molecular dynamics simulation \n\n molecular dynamics simulations are a decision-making process for inspections of protein-drug complexes ' stabilities ( al-khafaji & taskin tok , ) . it is used to clarify the dynamic behavior at an atomic level of biological systems , which is hard to handle in labs ( shukla et al. , ) . in the current study , we conducted molecular dynamics simulations for the top three drugs based on mmgbsa values . the got protein-drug complex structures from covalent docking were submitted to md simulations ( saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir with sars-cov-2 mpro ) . we hired gromacs 2018.1 to run 50 ns md simulations ( abraham et al. , ) . charmm 27 force field for all atoms were chosen to run md simulation ( bjelkmar et al. , ) . we used swiss param to produce the topologies of drugs ( zoete et al. , ) . all protein-drug systems were solvated with three-point transferable intermolecular potential ( tip3p ) and their charges were neutralized via adding na or cl ions . in the following step , the protein-drugs systems were energetically minimized through the steepest descent algorithm at a tolerance value of 1000 kj/mol.nm . then the equilibration with position restraint on the protein molecules for 0.1 ns using nvt and npt ensembles were done . electrostatic interactions were evaluated by particle mesh ewald summation ( darden et al. , ) . we performed the molecular dynamics simulation with no restraint on the protein molecules or ligand to determine the stability in the final step ( time step of 0.015 ns ) . rmsd , rmsf , rg , and number of hydrogen bonds were chosen to analyze md trajectories by using gromacs utilities . \n\n principal component analysis \n\n the principal component analysis ( pca ) approach was employed to calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues and their projection along with the first two principal components ( al-khafaji & taskin tok , ) . this approach is based on the protocol of gromacs 2018.1 ( abraham et al. , ) . it is used to simplify the effect of drugs on the dynamic motion of the targeted protein where it extracts the dynamic motions in simulations that are required for their biological function ( amadei et al. , ) . we got the principal component analysis from the md trajectories . a series of eigenvectors and eigenvalues were generated by diagonalizing the matrix . we chose trajectories of the protein backbone of the complexes to get 2 d-projection of motion of trajectory . \n\n results \n\n to assess the possibility of selected fda drugs to work as treatment of sars-cov-2 , the covalent docking was utilized to screen the selected library and rank them according to their binding affinities . the calculated binding free energies of some available drugs using docking score , glide gscore , and ensemble-average mm/gbsa are shown in table 1 . \n\n to validate our covalent docking results , the correlation between mmgbsa and docking score was constructed ( figure 1 ) . the binding energy mmgbsa-docking score correlation shows a good correlation ( r2 = 0.6299 ) . based on this correlation , we chose the top three ranked-mmgbsa and docking score values of fda drugs for dissection their binding modes inside the binding site . covalent docking showed that saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir , and prevacid have -72.17 , -72.02 , -65.19 , -57.65 , -54.25 , -51.8 , and -51.14 , respectively . where all the top-eight fda drugs show a higher affinity to form a covalent , irreversible bond with cys145 of sars-cov-2 mpro . here we investigated the role of molecular weight upon the affinity of selected drugs to bind covalently to cys145 , whereas 57 % of selected drugs which have molecular weight over than 600 g/mol ( figure 2 ) . and have higher free binding energy mmgbsa than -50 kcal/mol . while the ratio of selected drugs decreased to be 16 % of drugs which can form covalent bonding with over than -50 kcal/mol . surprisingly , none of the selected drugs which have a molecular weight below than 300 g/mol can form a good affinity of binding energy . this indicates that higher molecular weight covalent warheads can form stable and efficient binding energy . \n\n the correlation between mmgbsa binding energies and docking score . \n\n effect of molecular weight upon the mmgbsa binding energy . \n\n docked complex analyses \n\n what stands out in the table 1 is saquinavir has the highest binding affinity ( lowest binding energy mmgbsa of 72.17 kcal/mol ) . therefore , the deep examination of saquinavir is needed . figure 3 shows that saquinavir not only formed covalent bond of 1.81 a with cys145 but also formed five hydrogen bonds inside the pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro . in the second rank ritonavir as presented in table 1 has -72.02 kcal/mol . \n\n covalent docking analysis of saquinavir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n this high affinity resulted from covalent bond between ritonavir and cys145 of 1.82 a ( figure 4 ) through nucleophilic addition to double bond reaction besides it interacted within binding site by forming three hydrogen bonds . despite remdesivir formed covalent bond with cys145 of 1.82 a and three hydrogen bonds ( figure 5 ) and this is similar to ritonavir , but the mmgbsa value is lower than that of ritonavir this may due to nature of reaction which in remdesivir nucleophilic addition to triple bond . \n\n covalent docking analysis of ritonavir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n covalent docking analysis of remdesivir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n molecular dynamic simulation \n\n the effect of drug-protein interactions upon dynamics of biological system is a fundamental in drug discovery thereby we used rmsd to investigate the influence of saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir upon the stability of sars-cov-2 mpro . we utilized gromacs to execute the md simulations of 50 ns for three drug-protein systems besides of apo protein . rmsd fluctuations for both apo and hollo forms were measured and presented . the rmsd was calculated to assess the overall dynamics , stability , and convergence of the various systems and the results are presented in figure 6 ( a ) . \n\n analysis of rmsd , rmsf , rg and hydrogen bonding of saquinvir-sars-cov-2 mpro , ritonavir- sars-cov-2 mpro and remdesivir- sars-cov-2 mpro . ( a ) the protein 's backbone rmsd values with respect to time . ( b ) rmsf of the protein 's backbone with respect to position of residue in the protein . ( c ) rg of the protein backbone over the entire time of md simulation . ( d ) the number of hydrogen bonds through all the time of md simulation . \n\n figure 6 ( a ) shows there is a significant decrease in the rmsd value when sars-cov-2 main protease whether it bound to saquinavir , ritonavir , or remedisivir . further analysis revealed that the rmsd average of apo sars-cov-2 main protease was 0.294 nm but when it bound to saquinavir , ritonavir , and remedisivir the rmsd averages were.01865 , 0.2130 , and 0.2053 nm , respectively . another significant aspect of md simulation is the flexibility of protein 's backbone which can be assessed through measuring rmsf value . the results of the comparative analysis between these drugs and their effects upon sars-cov-2 main protease are illustrated in figure 6 ( b ) . closer scrutiny of figure 6 ( b ) exhibits the binding of saquinavir diminished the fluctuations of the protein 's backbone . and behavior is also can be seen from figure 6 ( b ) where the binding of both ritonavir and remedisivir led to reducing the flexibility of the protein . the radius of gyration ( rg ) is a definition of system 's density , and substantially influences the folding rate and stability of proteins . rg was employed to assess the compactness of all complexes . in this work , rg values are in agreement with rmsf values where there are no significant differences between apo form and hollo forms as presented in figure 6 ( c ) . this reveals that protein remained stable and compact all through the 50 ns time . the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds is a vital aspect to give an impression about the stability of drug and protein . also , the number of hydrogen bonds is relevant to the binding scores of molecular docking process . we calculated the hydrogen bonds over time to validate the stable interactions between top three drugs and their corresponding target . as seen in the figure 6 ( d ) the ritonavir has highest order of hydrogen bonding ( the average =3.35 ) , while saquinavir has an average of 1.68 . \n\n principle component analysis ( pca ) \n\n the essential dynamic method is a tool to explore the dynamical behavior in the space of sars-cov-2 main protease combined with saquinavir , ritonavir , and remedisivir . basically , the comparison of the drug-bound sars-cov-2 mpro and drug-unbound was made as reference . in order to further understand the configurational space , we selected the first two principal components ( pc1 , pc2 ) to analyze their projection of trajectories during the simulations of ligand free and ligand bound sars-cov-2 mpro of the phase space ( shown in figure 7 ) . during the four system simulations , the results clearly show that the unbound ligand protein covered a wider region of phase space , while all three drug-protein system occupied a smaller region of phase space . especially , saquinavir reduced the essential dynamics to lowest degree of functional motions as compared with another drugs . moreover , the pca results suggest that the drug-bound sars-cov-2 mpro is more stable than ligand-unbound sars-cov-2 mpro form of sars-cov-2 mpro . in short , the pca results are also in agreement with the rmsd and rmsf results , which enhance the validity of the performed analysis . \n\n two-dimensional projection of motion of trajectory of sars-cov-2 mpro bound with drugs over the pc1 and pc2 . \n\n discussion \n\n sars-cov-2 causes major pandemic health issue since its spread across the world and can infect humans mainly respiratory system causing severe pneumonia with no vaccine and drug treatment available . prior study that have referred to the significance of molecular docking to determine effective treatment in short time ( wu , et al. , ) . in reviewing the literature , we took the advantage of possibility of fda available drugs that can be as a covalent warhead to inhibit the sars-cov-2 mpro with cys145 . an initial objective of the project was to identify effective and applicable treatment . the present study focused on the main protease ( mpro ) , especially pdb id ( 6lu7 ) as a potential target for several marketed drugs as possible therapeutic option to combat the virus to see the capability of these drugs to bind with the cysteine 145 residue which is available in the binding site of sars-cov-2 main protease . the mpro in sars-cov-2 is necessary for the proteolytic maturation of the virus targeting this protein to limit the expansion of infection by hindering the cleavage of the viral polyprotein . the most interesting finding was that the both saquinavir and ritonavir have the same affinity ( binding energy mmgbsa -72 kcal/mol ) to block binding site of sars-cov-2 with irreversible interactions . this study supports evidence from previous observations that lopinavir/ritonavir can inhibit sars-cov-2 ( lim et al. , ) . another important outcome was that the remdesivir comes in second rank with binding affinity ( mmgbsa = -65 kcal/mol ) . whereas previous research has established that remdesivir can inhibit sars-cov-2 m proenzyme through docking results . another significant finding , delavirdine computationally showed the ability to form irreversible covalent bond of -57.65 kcal/mol mmgbsa binding energy . moreover , indinavir and cefuroxime axetil exhibited the possibility to halt the pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro by forming stable interaction through covalent bonding and hydrogen bonding ( mmgbsa binding energies -54 kcal/mol ) . furthermore , oseltamivir and prevacid exhibited same affinity to bind with sars-cov-2 protease through one covalent bond and one hydrogen bond ( -51 kcal/mol ) , which is a good explanation for the activity of oseltamivir ( peeri et al. , ) . in this study , results obtained show the binding affinity of drugs to an active site depends on several factors mainly the ability of a compound to form a covalent bond with amino acid residues of the mpro ( cys145 ) and length of a covalent bond , the number of h-bonds that can form with a pocket of the active site and type of nucleophilic addition of unsaturated bonds . in this concept , the structural features in saquinavir and ritonavir like free amine group ( -nh2 ) , hydroxyl groups ( -oh ) , carbonyl groups ( c=o ) in addition to ether group play key structural feature to form h-bond . results show the promising activities for antiretroviral drugs saquinavir that used for hiv/aids more than ritonavir and remdesivir followed by lopinavir as the best drugs to bind covalently toward sars-cov-2 mpro with lowest energy of binding . as discussed above , saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir , and prevacid showed the ability to block the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro by forming covalent bond and stabilized with hydrogen bonding . \n\n these outcomes are contrary to that of kandeel and al-nazawi ( 2020 ) , they found that ribavirin , telbivudine , vitamin b12 , and nicotinamide can be can form non-bonding interactions . whilst our results showed that , saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir can form irreversible interactions , which are considered an effective way for viral infections . \n\n in the present work , comparative molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir on the conformational and dynamical demeanor in either apo or hollo forms to understand the inhibitory possibility at atomic level . an initial mission of the project was to identify rapid , effective , safe , and available for large proportions of people , so we run covalent docking and mmgbsa to sift the possibility of these drug to form irreversible interactions . therefore , we had chosen these drugs because they carry covalent warheads that can bind covalently to the target . but the docking results are not adequate , so we run md simulations examine how much these drugs are able to form stable interactions with targeted protein . one interesting finding is the rmsd of protein backbone in apo status has higher average value , whereas the binding with top three drugs diminished these rmsd average . another important finding was that the rmsf of protein 's backbone be less flexible when it compared to apo form of sars-cov-2 main protease . it is somewhat surprising that the binding of three drugs have not noted in rg values . it is not yet clear whether the top three drugs can show an evidence to inhibit the targeted protein , thereby we lean on the principal component analysis to analyze the md trajectories to judge without dispute . the most obvious finding to emerge from 2d pca analysis is that the binding of under investigated drugs caused stately impact on essential dynamics of protein by reducing its essential dynamics to its least possible motions . these results seem to be consistent with rmsd results . a possible explanation for this might be that binding of the drugs make the binding site much narrower due to hydrogen bindings this makes the 3d structure of targeted protein more rigid so it will lose its biological functions . it is possible , therefore , that using these available drugs in two ways : either alone or in combined way . these findings suggest the possible use of nominated drugs against sars-cov-2 in short time as approved by covalent docking screening . also , the present results are significant in at least directing the clinicians to use these safe drugs to stop development of corona virus and second giving hope that available drugs that can be efficient treatment . \n\n conclusions \n\n coronavirus today emphasizes as a potential threat to all people worldwide . although extensive researches have been directed to stop sars-cov-2 , but till now there is no medication . meanwhile , the spreading with complicated crisis requires immediate therapy to overcome the spread and minimize mortality of sars-cov-2 . the aim of the present study was to discover effective treatment through repurposing some of available fda-approved drugs against sars-cov-2 mpro . where , they can provide covalent warheads in virtual screening . the most prominent finding to emerge from this study is that the affinity of covalent binder toward sars-cov-2 mpro is ranked : saquinavir > ritonavir > remdesivir > delavirdine > cefuroxime axetil > oseltamivir = prevacid . one of the more noteworthy findings in this study is that md simulation analysis that saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir can form stable interaction inside the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro . also , they restricted the essential motions of protein . overall , the results of screening toward mpret encourage for further clinical evaluations . they can be easy to reach and exploit as persuasive treatments for sars-cov-2 . \n\n acknowledgements \n\n authors thankful for staff membered of gaziantep university institute of health sciences , department of bioinformatics and computational biology . \n\n

00001000	strength , weakness , opportunity , threat ( swot ) analysis of the adaptations to anatomical education in the united kingdom and republic of ireland in response to the coivd-19 pandemic . \n\n the covid-19 pandemic has driven the fastest changes to higher education across the globe , necessitated by social distancing measures preventing any face to face teaching . this has led to an almost immediate switch to distance learning by higher education institutions . anatomy faces some unique challenges . intrinsically , anatomy is a three-dimensional subject that requires a sound understanding of the relationships between structures , often achieved by the study of human cadaveric material , models and virtual resources . this study sought to identify the approaches taken in the united kingdom and republic of ireland to deliver anatomical education through online means . data were collected from 14 different universities in the united kingdom and republic of ireland and compared adopting a thematic analysis approach . once themes were generated , they were collectively brought together using a strength , weakness , opportunity , threat ( swot ) analysis . key themes included the opportunity to develop new online resources and the chance to engage in new academic collaborations . academics frequently mentioned the challenge that time constrains could place on the quality and effectiveness of these resources ; especially as in many cases the aim of these resources is to compensate for a lack of exposure to cadaveric exposure . comparisons of the actions taken by multiple higher education institutions reveals the ways that academics have tried to balance this demand . discussions will facilitate decisions being made by higher education institutions regarding adapting the curriculum and assessment methods in anatomy . 
10001000	early trends for sars-cov-2 infection in central and north texas and impact on other circulating respiratory viruses . \n\n introduction : rapid diagnosis and isolation are key to containing the quick spread of a pandemic agent like sars-cov-2 , which has spread globally since its initial outbreak in wuhan province in china . sars-cov-2 is novel and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal viruses is just becoming apparent . we present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of march , 2020 . methods : this is a retrospective cohort study post launching of sars-cov-2 testing at baylor scott and white hospital ( bswh ) , temple , texas . testing for sars-cov-2 was performed by real-time rt-pcr assay and results were shared with state public health officials for immediate interventions . results : more than 3500 tests were performed during the first two weeks of testing for sars-cov-2 and identified 168 ( 4.7 % ) positive patients . sixty-two ( 3.2 % ) of the 1,912 ambulatory patients and 106 ( 6.3 % ) of the 1,659 ed/inpatients tested were positive . the highest rate of infection ( 6.9 % ) was seen in patients aged 25-34 years , while the lowest rate of infection was seen among patients aged < 25 years old ( 2 % ) . county-specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions . incidentally , this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of seasonal respiratory virus infections , perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness about sars-cov-2 among the general public , as well as the social distancing measures implemented in response to sars-cov-2 . data extracted for bswh from the cdc 's national respiratory and enteric virus surveillance system ( nrevss ) site revealed that influenza incidence was 8.7 % in march 2020 , compared to 25 % in march 2019 . conclusions : this study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management . this study provided sars-cov-2 testing data from ambulatory and inpatient population . epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like sars-cov-2 . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved . 
01000000	reverse vaccinology approach to design a novel multi-epitope vaccine candidate against covid-19 : an in silico study \n\n abstract \n\n at present , novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov , the causative agent of covid-19 ) has caused worldwide social and economic disruption . the disturbing statistics of this infection promoted us to develop an effective vaccine candidate against the covid-19 . in this study , bioinformatics approaches were employed to design and introduce a novel multi-epitope vaccine against 2019-ncov that can potentially trigger both cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell immune responses and investigated its biological activities by computational tools . three known antigenic proteins ( nucleocapsid , orf3a , and membrane protein , hereafter called nom ) from the virus were selected and analyzed for prediction of the potential immunogenic b and t-cell epitopes and then validated using bioinformatics tools . based on in silico analysis , we have constructed a multi-epitope vaccine candidate ( nom ) with five rich-epitopes domain including highly scored t and b-cell epitopes . after predicting and evaluating of the third structure of the protein candidate , the best 3 d predicted model was applied for docking studies with toll-like receptor 4 ( tlr4 ) and hla-a * 11:01 . in the next step , molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation was used to evaluate the stability of the designed fusion protein with tlr4 and hla-a * 11:01 receptors . md studies demonstrated that the nom-tlr4 and nom-hla-a * 11:01 docked models were stable during simulation time . in silico evaluation showed that the designed chimeric protein could simultaneously elicit humoral and cell-mediated immune responses . \n\n communicated by ramaswamy h. sarma \n\n introduction \n\n coronavirus disease covid-19 outbreak began in late december 2019 in wuhan , the capital of hubei province , china ( wang et al. , ) . scientists from all over the world are attempting to investigate this novel virus , known as 2019-ncov , which is highly contagious , and to discover effective interventions to control and prevent the disease ( heymann , ; huang et al. , ) . coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses ( ssrna+ ) belonging to the coronaviridae family . human coronaviruses hcov-229e , hcov-nl63 , hcov-oc43 , and hcov-hku1 are observed in almost one-third of the common cold ( lim et al. , ) . however , recently some cases of human coronavirus infections have led to fatal endemics , including sars ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) , mers ( middle east respiratory syndrome ) and covid-19 that are common diseases between humans and animals whose belong to the genus betacoronavirus of the coronaviridae family ( al-tawfiq et al. , ) . so far , the novel covid-19 has caused more than 700,000 illnesses and more than 33,000 deaths worldwide ( w.h.o. , 2020 ) . the genome size of this virus is about 30 kb and encodes structural and non-structural proteins like other coronaviruses . structural proteins include s protein ( spike ) , e protein ( envelope ) , m protein ( membrane ) , and n protein ( nucleocapsid ) ( ahmed et al. , ) . the increasing rate of covid-19 disease and the high morbidity necessitate the development of a specific and safe vaccine candidate as soon as possible . there is very little known actually about the pathogenesis of the virus ; therefore , an immunoinformatics-based approach to investigate the immunogenic epitopes and vaccine design using data from proteins sequencing of the covid-19 is required . \n\n n protein is the only structural protein that associates with replicase-transcriptase complexes and binds with genomic rna in coronaviruses ( cong et al. , ) . this protein is multifunctional and one of the most crucial structural components of coronaviruses . n protein is a structural and antigenic protein that is involved in packaging , transcription , and replication coronaviruses ( 4 ) . this data showed that n protein is a suitable candidate for targeting drug and vaccine design because this protein is conserved , antigenic and multifunctional ( 6 ) . leung and et al . concluded that n protein can be a suitable vaccine candidate against sars-cov because induce strong antibody and this process may trigger cytokine production ( leung et al. , ) . coronaviruses m protein also has a key role in the assembly of virions . the sars-cov m protein can interact with n protein and make a network of interactions with the genomic rna ( he et al. , ) . ong and et al . the covid-19 antigens such as s , n and m proteins introduced as a vaccine candidate ( 6 ) . this protein has also been studied as an epitope vaccine candidate against sars-cov ( 7 ) . \n\n open reading frame 3a ( orf3a ) is required for viral replication and virulence of sars cov . severe induction of proinflammatory cytokine is a sign of sars-cov and mers-cov infections . orf3a activates both pro-il-1beta gene expression and il-1beta secretion and leads to severe lung injury . ( siu et al. , ) . also , orf3a has an important role in sars-cov assembly or budding with the participation of m and e proteins ( mcbride & fielding , ) . these proteins are not only involved in the pathogenesis of the covid-19 virus but also have high antigenicity ( chan et al. , ; siu et al. , ; xu et al. , ) . in this study e , m , n , orf10 , orf8 , orf3a and m proteins were evaluated by available bioinformatics tools for designing an efficient multi-epitope vaccine for the stimulation of immune responses against covid-19 infection . \n\n since the covid-19 has been recently discovered , little immunological information is available . preliminary studies based on phylogenetic analyses of the covid-19 whole genome have suggested that this virus is very similar to the sars-cov ( 79.7 % identify ) ( 9 , 14 ) . given the apparent similarity between the two viruses , it could be concluded that previous studies on the protective immune responses against sars-cov may be useful for developing a vaccine for covid-19 . previous studies have suggested that both humoral and cellular immunity play important roles in protective responses against this virus ( deming et al. , ; yang et al. , ) . studies revealed that the formation of antibodies against the n protein of sars-cov , an immunogenic protein that is highly expressed during infection , is relatively common in patients infected with this virus ( liu et al. , ; lin et al. , ) . although these antibodies are effective , they have a shorter lifespan in recovering the patients . in addition to the specific humoral immunity , it has been shown that the cd4+ and cd8+ responses provide long-lasting protection against covid-19 . these studies showed that besides antibody-mediated immune response , cellular immunity is critical to induce protectivity in these infections ( liu et al. , ) . the concept of a multi-epitope vaccine is to efficiently identify and assemble b and t-cell epitopes that are more capable of stimulating the immune system and therefore can induce more potent and effective both arms of immune responses . peptides and epitopes have shown to be desirable candidates for vaccine development due to their relatively easy production , chemical stability , and lack of infectious potential ( patronov & doytchinova , ) . the experimental design and production of multi-epitope vaccines have improved dramatically in recent years . these vaccines are mainly made up of b-cell , cd8+ cytolytic t-cell ( ctls ) and cd4+ helper t-cells ( htls ) epitopes ( chiarella et al. , ) . since the antigenic epitopes of a protein could be predicted and detected , therefore the whole protein is not suitable to stimulate an immune response ( testa & philip , ; zheng et al. , ) . during the development of a vaccine candidate against covid-19 , complex pathogenic mechanisms and numerous pathogenic factors should be considered in vaccine formulation . \n\n in the present study , we aimed to design a novel multi-epitope fusion protein ( nucleocapsid , orf3a , and membrane protein or nom ) containing more efficient antigenic epitopes-rich domains . the biological activity of the engineered fusion protein was assessed by bioinformatics tools using the interaction between the vaccine candidate and the innate immune system receptor ( tlr4 ) and cellular immune system receptor ( hla-a * 11:01 ) . we strongly believe that the outcome of the present report will provide a potential vaccine candidate against 2019-ncov . \n\n materials and methods \n\n in this study , we designed a suitable vaccine candidate against covid-19 , by exploiting the programs of reverse vaccinology ( figure 1 ) \n\n strategies employed in the overall study . \n\n retrieval of protein sequences \n\n at first , the amino acid sequences of proteins were retrieved from the national centre for biotechnology information ( ncbi ) at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov in fasta format and performed for subsequent analysis ( table 1 ) . \n\n name protein accession number fasta nucleocapsid protein qic53221.1 > qic53221.1 nucleocapsid protein [ severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ] [ severe acute

selected six proteins of covid-19 virus ( table 1 ) that have an essential role in virulence and replication of the virus , and previous studies have highlighted the necessity of these proteins in coronaviruses function . after the antigenic analysis of these proteins , three proteins of n , orf3a , and m were selected for final analysis . \n\n prediction of t-cell ( hla class i and ii ) epitopes \n\n 1d sequence-based screening server rankpep was used to identify t-cell epitopes ( reche & reinherz , ) . this server predicts peptide binders to mhc molecules from protein sequences using the position-specific scoring matrix ( pssm ) . we have selected all hla class i alleles from the selection panel of rankpep server for prediction of epitopes of hla class i . to prediction of epitopes of hla class ii , we considered drb1 * 0101 , drb1 * 0301 , drb1 * 0401 , drb1 * 0701 , drb1 * 0801 , drb1 * 1101 , drb1 * 1301 , and drb1 * 1501 that cover hla variability of over 95 % of the human population worldwide ( kruiswijk et al. , ) . \n\n b-cell epitopes ( linear ) identification \n\n for the prediction of b-cell epitopes , the amino acid sequence was analyzed using bepipred and kolaskar & tongaonkar antigenicity ( http : //www.iedb.org/ ) servers ( vita et al. , ) . bepipred for linear epitope prediction uses both hidden markov model and amino acid propensity scales methods . kolaskar and tongaonkar evaluate the protein for b cell epitopes using the physicochemical properties of the amino acids and their frequencies of occurrence in recognized b cell epitopes ( kolaskar & tongaonkar , ; mirza et al. , ) . \n\n selection of epitope-rich domains and the final sequence \n\n according to the prediction results of the servers used , b cell epitopes and hla class i and ii epitopes that have had high scores were extracted and combined to generate multi-epitope protein . b cell and t cell epitope-rich domains of n , orf3a and m proteins were selected and joined to each other with an aaa linker . \n\n antigenicity and allergenicity evaluation \n\n antigenicity of designed recombinant protein predicted using the vaxijen v2.0 server . the vaxijen classified antigens based on auto cross-covariance ( acc ) transformation of protein sequences into uniform vectors of principal amino acid properties which is a novel alignment-independent method and overcome the limitations of alignment-dependent sequence methods ( doytchinova & flower , ) . the prediction of vaccine candidate allergenicity is essential . the allergenicity of the designed protein was computed by allertop ( http : //www.ddg-pharmfac.net/allertop/ ) . allertop method predicts recombinant protein allergenicity on auto cross-covariance acc that describe residue hydrophobicity , size , abundance , helix- and beta-strand forming propensities ( dimitrov et al. , ) . allertop v.2 has the highest accuracy ( 88.7 % ) compared to several servers for allergen prediction ( dimitrov et al. , ) . \n\n the physicochemical parameters \n\n the analyzed parameters consisted of the molecular weight , theoretical pi , amino acid composition , atomic composition , extinction coefficient , estimated half-life , instability index , aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathicity that were evaluated by protparam online server ( http : //us.expasy.org/tools/ protparam.html ) ( gasteiger et al. , ) . \n\n secondary and tertiary structure prediction \n\n gor was used for the designed protein secondary structure prediction ( https : //npsa-prabi.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat.pl ? page=/npsa/npsa_gor4.html ) ( kloczkowski et al. , ) . gor4 predict protein secondary structure using information theory . \n\n the tertiary structure was built using the galaxy web . galaxyweb server ( http : //galaxy.seoklab.org/ tbm ) is based on the tbm method . this server detects similar proteins and alignment with the target sequence , then make the model and finally perform model refinement ( shin et al. , ) . \n\n tertiary structure refinement and validation \n\n the best-modeled structure was refined using the galaxy refine server at ( http : //galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi ? type=refine ) . galaxy refined the model by molecular dynamics simulation . this method showed one of the best performances in improving protein structure quality . \n\n analysis of the final 3 d model was made using molprobity , prosa and ramachandran plot . ramachandran plot obtained from rampage calculates torsional angles residue-by-residue in protein and indicates that residues are in allowed , favored or outlier regions ( oberholser , ) . prosa web used to recognize the errors in the generated 3 d models using atomic coordinates of the model . prosa web was created z-score ( overall model quality ) and a plot of residue energies of proteins ( wiederstein & sippl , ) . clash analysis is very important for the validation of proteins . molprobity is a structure-validation web service that calculates the clash score , protein-geometry score , poor rotamers , ramachandran plot , and molprobity score . \n\n defining discontinuous b-cell epitopes of designed protein \n\n the interaction between antigen epitopes and antibodies is very essential to eliminate the infection . conformational epitopes are the most important and the most prevalent epitopes that are recognized by antibodies . all conformational epitope prediction methods require the 3 d structures of proteins . discontinuous epitopes of recombinant protein predicted using the ellipro server . this web-based predicts discontinuous epitopes based on protein-antibody interactions . ellipro server predicts conformational and linear b cell epitopes using thornton 's method and by modeller program or blast search of pdb predict and visualize of antibody epitopes ( ponomarenko et al. , ) . \n\n obtaining and preparing the structures of immune receptors and nom recombinant protein \n\n the crystallographic structures of tlr4 ( pdb id : 2z62 ( kim et al. , ) ) and hla-a * 11:01 ( pdb id : 5wjl ( culshaw et al. , 2017 ) ) were obtained from the pdb database ( berman et al. , ) . the structures were cleaned and crystallographic waters and co-crystallized molecules were deleted and only the monomer forms of each receptor were kept . then , the structures of the two receptors and the nom protein were prepared by the dock prep tool in ucsf chimera software ( pettersen et al. , ) where hydrogen atoms and charge were added to the structures to make them ready for the next step . in the next step , to stabilize and relax the structures in an aqueous physiological environment , each of the monomer form of the receptors and the nom protein were simulated for 100 ns . the details of the md simulation will be explained later . \n\n protein-protein molecular docking and refinement \n\n after the md simulation of each receptor and the nom recombinant protein , the last frame of the trajectory of each simulation was extracted and used as the input structures for protein-protein molecular docking . the patchdock webserver ( schneidman-duhovny et al. , ) with default parameters was used to predict the best positions and orientations where the two proteins can have the highest number of favorable interactions . afterward , the top 10 solutions were subjected to firedock webserver ( andrusier et al. , ; mashiach et al. , ) to refine the interaction of protein-protein complexes resulted from molecular docking . the top two complexes from coronavirus nom protein-tlr4 and nom recombinant protein-hla-a * 11:01 complexes were chosen based on global energies . these four complexes were then taken to the next step , md simulation . \n\n molecular dynamics simulation \n\n after performing the protein-protein molecular docking and finding the best orientations of the vaccine candidate and the receptor proteins to interact with one another , the two best-scored complexes were subjected to md simulation . all of the md simulations were done by gromacs 2018 package ( abraham et al. , ) and opls-aa force field ( jorgensen et al. , ) . the monomer form of each protein and also the docked complexes were placed in the center of a triclinic box with a distance of 1 nm from all edges and solvated with tip3p water model ( jorgensen et al. , ) . then , sodium and chloride ions were added to produce a neutral physiological salt concentration of 150 mm . each system was energy minimized , using the steepest descent algorithm , until the fmax was found to be smaller than 10 kj.mol-1nm-1 . all of the covalent bonds were constrained using the linear constraint solver ( lincs ) algorithm ( hess et al. , ) to maintain constant bond lengths . the long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh ewald ( pme ) method ( darden et al. , ; essmann et al. , ) and the cut off radii for coulomb and van der waals short-range interactions were set to 0.9 nm . then 100 ps nvt ( constant number of particles ( n ) , volume ( v ) , and temperature ( t ) ) and 300 ps npt ( constant number of particles ( n ) , pressure ( p ) , and temperature ( t ) ) equilibrations were performed for each system . after the necessary equilibrations , 100 ns of production run were performed for each of the four complexes . finally , simulations were carried out under the periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , set at xyz coordinates to ensure that the atoms had stayed inside the simulation box , and the subsequent analyses were then performed using gromacs utilities , vmd ( humphrey et al. , ) and uscf chimera , and also the plots and the figures were created using daniel 's xl toolbox ( v 7.3.2 ) add-in ( kraus , ) and ezmol ( reynolds et al. , ) . all of the computations were performed on an ubuntu desktop pc , with a [ intel ( r ) xeon ( r ) cpu e5-2630 v3 + nvidia geforce gtx 1080 ] configuration . \n\n mmpbsa binding free energy \n\n the binding free energies of the protein-protein complexes were calculated by molecular mechanics-poisson-boltzmann solvent-accessible surface area , mmpbsa method ( kollman et al. , ) using g_mmpbsa package ( kumari et al. , ) . in this method , the binding free energy is the result of the free energy of the complex minus the sum of the free energies of the ligand and the protein . in our case , the nom recombinant protein is defined as the ligand and the immune receptors are defined as the receptors . the mmpbsa calculation was done for every ns of each simulation trajectories . \n\n results and discussion \n\n defining t-cell epitopes \n\n the results of several studies have shown that strong virus-specific t-cell response is required for the elimination of respiratory virus infections such as sars-cov and influenza a and para-influenza . these studies conclude that future vaccine interventions should also consider strategies to enhance t cell response to provide robust long-term memory ( channappanavar et al. , ; janice oh et al. , ) . studies have shown that high levels of t cell responses against n protein were found 2 years after the patient 's recovery ( peng et al. , ) . antibodies are essential to combat sars-cov infection , and the body needs sars-cov specific cd4+ t helper cells to produce these specific antibodies . also , cd8+ cytotoxic t cells are important for recognizing and killing infected cells , especially in the lungs of infected individuals . we used the rankpep server which covers almost all hla supertypes to predicted different epitops from n , orf3a and m proteins sequence according to hla i and hla ii alleles . antigenic epitopes with high binding affinity score were predicted that are summarized in table 2a-b . \n\n antigen hla_a0201 hla_a0204 hla_a0206 hla_b0702 hla_b51 hla_b5401 hla_b5301 nucleocapsid protein 316-324 299-307 66-74 343-351 66-74 45-53 gmsrigmev

such as measles and rubella reflects the importance of protective antibodies . protection against virus infection such as coronaviruses depends on the simulation of neutralizing antibodies in addition to the t cell-mediated immunity . while cytotoxic lymphocytes can kill infected cells , antibodies have the potential to eliminate infected cells and prevent the infectious virus from infecting a cell ( neutralization ) . sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies block viral entry ( dorner & radbruch , ; hsueh et al. , ) . in this study , for the linear epitope prediction , the bepipred server was employed . bepipred analysis revealed several continuous predicted epitopes of n , orf3a and m proteins . for cross-checking the predicted epitopes , the sequence of all three proteins was also predicted by kolaskar & tongaonkar antigenicity . the linear b-cell epitopes are represented in ( table 3 ) . given that both cellular and humoral immune responses are essential against coronaviruses infection ( janice oh et al. , ) , finally , epitopes that were shared between b cell and t-cell were selected . \n\n selected targets for designing the final vaccine \n\n the main strategy in the present study was to design and construct a novel multi-epitope protein from covid-19 based on in silico methods to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses . due to the low immunogenicity of the epitope , we chose epitope-rich domains to generate a more diverse and robust response ( wieser et al. , ) . based on in silico analysis , five epitope-rich domains including highly scored and shared epitopes between t and b-cell epitopes were selected and joined to each other with a three aaa linker ( table 4 ) . the schematic diagram of designed vaccine domains with linker 's sites has been shown in figure 2 . \n\n the schematic diagram of the vaccine candidate construct consists of n , orf3a and m proteins epitopes of the covid-19 linked together with aaa linkers . \n\n antigen server

allergenicity \n\n prediction of the vaccine candidate antigenicity represents a numerical criterion for the capability of the vaccine to bind to the b- and t-cell receptors and increase the immune response in the host cell . vaxijen v2.0 was used to predict the antigenicity of the designed protein . vaxijen analysis of nom protein showed potent antigenicity 0.5999 with a 0.4 % threshold . the results indicate that the designed protein sequences without adjuvant are antigenic . \n\n allergen proteins induce an ige antibody response ( dimitrov et al. , ) . the designed vaccine candidate must not show an allergic reaction to the body . the allergenicity of the sequence was predicted using the allertop tool . based on prediction approaches in allertop , this protein was not recognized as an allergen . \n\n the physicochemical parameters and protein secondary structure prediction \n\n primary structure analysis nom designed protein ( 337 aa ) has a molecular weight of 37513.57 d. the total number of positively charged residues ( arg + lys ) and negatively charged residues ( asp + glu ) were 19 and 32 respectively . the theoretical isoelectric point ( pi ) was calculated at 9.62 . the instability index ( < 40 ) indicates that the designed protein has high stability for the initiation of an immunogenic reaction . the instability index ( ii ) was 35.75 which classifies the protein as stable . the aliphatic index of nom recombinant protein was calculated 97.92 and indicates this protein has stability in several temperatures . \n\n natively unfolded protein regions and alpha-helix are important forms of structural antigens that can be arranged in their native structure and thus identified by antibodies that are produced in response to infection . ( shey et al. , ) . the composition of the predicted secondary structure of the nom multi-epitope vaccine candidate was 43.92 % ( alpha helix ) , 16.02 % ( extended strand ) , and 40.06 % ( random coil ) . all this information indicates the designed protein is suitable as a vaccine candidate . \n\n tertiary structure prediction and validation \n\n three-dimensional structure was modeled by galaxyweb for our designed protein ( figure 3a ) . this model was used for evaluation and refinement . for validation of the model , prosa-web , ramachandran plot and molprobity were used that compare and analyze the protein structure . the prosa web determined z-score for the best predicted 3 d model ( figure 3b ) . the z-score of the nom predicted model was -4.42 , which is within the range of scores typically found for native proteins of similar size . the ramachandran plot indicates that most of the residues are found in the favored and allowed regions ( 99.7 % ) and only 0.3 % in the outlier region , this shows that the quality of the designed model is satisfactory . phe 282 , asn311 , tyr228 , lys194 , asp223 , ser229 , ser4 , his197 , tyr68 residues were observed in the allowed and outlier regions of ramachandran plot ( figure 3c ) . in molprobity analysis , the all-atom clash score was 9.37 , the molprobity score was 2.21 . all structural images were created using pymol ( the pymol molecular graphics system , version 1.1 , schrodinger , llc ) . \n\n ( a-c ) prediction and validation of tertiary structure of the nom recombinant protein using ( a ) prediction of the

b-cell epitopes from the 3 d structure of nom recombinant protein . discontinuous b-cell epitopes were predicted with scores ranging from0.679 to 0.945 . amino acid residues , the number of residues , sequence location as well as their scores have been listed in tables 5 . the graphical representation of the discontinuous epitopes has been displayed in figure 4 . \n\n three-dimensional

conformational b-cell epitopes from vaccine protein using ellipro server . \n\n establishing the stability of the initial structures \n\n a vaccine can interact with different receptors of the immune system . we have docked designed final constructs ( nom ) with tlr4 and hla-a * 11:01 receptors . the interaction between these receptors and nom recombinant protein induce different immune responses . to achieve a stable and relaxed state of the nom recombinant protein and the immune receptors , a md simulation of 100 ns was performed for each structure . these simulations ensure that the structures are stable enough to be used for protein-protein molecular docking . after 100 ns of the production run , as it is shown in figure 5 , the rmsd ( root mean square distance ) values of the monomers show that the backbone structure of tlr4 ( pdb id : 2z62 ) is very rigid and stable . the structure of the nom recombinant protein also reached stability after about 25 ns after a considerable structural change . the backbone structure of the hla-a * 11:01 ( pdb id : 5wjl ) , however , showed big spikes in the rmsd values but all three structures were visually inspected and were considered stable enough for the next step of the project . \n\n the rmsd values of the simulated monomer forms of the proteins throughput the 100 ns of production runs . \n\n protein-protein molecular docking \n\n to find the best orientation for optimal interaction of the nom protein with the immune receptors we decided to use protein-protein molecular docking . we used patchdock webserver which concentrates on recognizing and matching patterns of the surfaces of the proteins to put them in the best possible positions . afterward , the top 10 best solutions were subjected to the firedock webserver to refine the docked structures . the firedock algorithms refine the docked complexes by side-chain rearrangement and soft rigid-body optimization . the ranking of the docked complexes is based on short-range , long-range , attractive and repulsive interaction energies between the residues of the two proteins , which are all summed up in the global energy or the binding energy of the complexes . we considered global energy as the main criterion for choosing the best complexes and chose the two top-scored solutions with the best global energy . as it is shown in table 6 , the solution numbers 5 and 6 from the nom-tlr4 complex and the solution numbers 2 and 3 , from nom-hla-a * 11:01 complex , were chosen for further calculations . the total energy plots of the simulations are shown in figure 6 . the results showed a strong interaction between designed protein amino acids and receptors . the interactions between the binding receptors and the docked nom protein were visualized using the ucsf chimera program . residues of hla-a * 1101 ( glu53 , asn174 , gly56 , asn174 , glu53 , pro57 ) participated in the interaction with arg49 , ser97 , gln91 , met102 , arg49 and gln91 residues of the candidate vaccine . also , nine residues of tlr4 ( tlr4 lys123 , ile319 , thr66 , ser90 , lys124 , lys46 , his85 , lys123 ) participated in the interaction with ser45 , glu199 , gln91 , ala84 , met328 , gln65 , ser90 , glu68 residues of the designed candidate vaccine . \n\n the total energy plots of the simulations . \n\n complex no of solution glob

simulation of top scored solutions \n\n after the protein-protein molecular docking , 4 solutions were chosen for md simulation , solution numbers 2 and 3 from nom protein-hla-a * 11:01 complex and solution numbers 5 and 6 from nom protein-tlr4 complex . each was simulated for 100 ns . to examine their stability throughout the simulations period , the rmsd values of each protein was analyzed . as it is shown in figure 7 , each protein has different rmsd values and in some of them , the backbone atoms have considerable movements during the simulations . the reason is that the interactions can get optimized and rearranged by introducing water molecules and physiological conditions . the rmsd values of tlr4 in nom protein-tlr4 complexes and the values of hla-a * 11:01 in nom protein-hla-a * 11:01 complexes are very stable and the average values do not reach very high values . however , the rmsd values of the nom protein in every complex reach high values which means that the structure of the vaccine has more movements to refine the interactions with the immune receptors . however , the interactions between the nom recombinant protein and the immune receptors are quite strong and mmpbsa binding energy calculations exhibit great binding energies . as it is shown in table 7 , the van der waals and electrostatic energies of the complexes are strong enough to keep the two proteins in contact with each other . moreover , the deviation of each value is very small which means that the interactions are very stable and consistent throughout the simulations . in another word , the higher scale of rmsd values with consistent binding energies only show that the structure of the nom protein is well optimized for interacting with the immune receptors . \n\n the rmsd

cfvlaavyrinwitggiaiamaclvglmwlsyfiasf \n\n five epitope-rich domains were selected \n\n in addition to the analysis described above , to analyze the fluctuations of the backbone atoms of structures of the proteins , we decided to perform rmsf ( root mean square fluctuation ) analysis . in this analysis , the average value of fluctuation of each residue during the simulation is plotted , figure 8 . as it is shown in figure 8a , the rmsf values of nom recombinant protein in five simulations indicate that the fluctuation of the monomer form of the vaccine in many regions is considerably more than the complex forms . this is a direct indication that the nom recombinant protein is much more stable when it is in complex with the two immune receptors . furthermore , the rmsf values of the nom recombinant protein in complex with hla-a * 11:01 are lower compared with that of nom recombinant protein in complex with tlr4 . also , with the evidence that the binding energies are also lower , we can conclude that nom recombinant protein can bind to the hla-a * 11:01 better than the other immune receptor . \n\n the rmsf values of each protein in the simulated complexes compared to the simulated monomer forms of the proteins throughout the 100 ns of production runs . a , the comparison of the rmsf values of nom recombinant protein in the complexes with the monomer form . b , the

the graphical illustration of the monomer forms and the complex forms of the nom recombinant protein and the hla-a * 11:01 and tlr4 immune receptors . \n\n in figure 8b and figure 8c , the rmsf values of the monomer forms of the immune receptors show lower values compared to the complex forms . this behavior is exactly the opposite of the nom designed protein . this can be an indication that the structures are very stable in their natural function and their structures considerably change when they get into contact with the designed nom protein . furthermore , the structural illustration of the monomer forms and also the complex forms of the vaccine and the immune receptors , figure 9 , shows that the vaccine can fill the cavities and bind tightly to them , as it was proved by the binding energies . \n\n conclusion \n\n covid-19 pandemic is much more than a health crisis . it leads to a political , social and economic crisis in the world . the development of a safe and effective vaccine could reduce the rate of this infection . immunoinformatics methods are valuable in reducing time and cost in vaccine design and other fields of life sciences . we have predicted and validated nom recombinant protein against hla-a * 11:01 and tlr4 receptors . our evaluation was based on vaccine candidate structural analysis and molecular docking and md simulations study . the nom-tlr4 and nom-hla-a * 11:01 complexes were very stable in their natural function with strong molecular interactions in around 100 ns . higher binding energy even after the md simulation of 100 ns confirmed the stability and specificity nom-tlr4 and nom- hla-a * 11:01 interaction . our vaccine candidate can stimulate both cellular and humoral immunity , given that b and t-cell epitopes have been selected in the final construct . taken all together , according to physicochemical evaluations as well as structural and immunological analyses , nom recombinant protein could be considered as a possible vaccine candidate against covid-19 . \n\n acknowledgements \n\n this work was supported by the hormozgan university of medical sciences under grant [ number : hums-rec.1398.647 ] , bandar

february , 2020 , china has 70 635 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , including 1772 deaths [ 1 ] . human-to-human spread of the virus via respiratory droplets is currently considered to be the main route of transmission . however , exhaled air dispersion during non-invasive respiratory support may increase the risk of coronavirus transmission , and requires more attention from medical personnel and patients . \n\n non-invasive respiratory support plays an essential role in the treatment of covid-19 . more awareness is needed of viral transmission through exhaled air . http : //bit.ly/39knrrf \n\n to the editor : \n\n as of 17 february , 2020 , china has 70 635 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , including 1772 deaths . human-to-human spread of the virus via respiratory droplets is currently considered to be the main route of transmission . however , exhaled air dispersion during non-invasive respiratory support may increase the risk of coronavirus transmission , and requires more attention from medical personnel and patients . \n\n according to the chinese centre for disease control and prevention , among 72 314 reported cases in mainland china ( 44 672 confirmed cases , 16 186 suspected cases , 10 567 clinically diagnosed cases , and 889 asymptomatic infected cases ) as of 11 february , 1716 medical staff were infected . notably , wang et al . analysed the clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalised cases with covid-19 and found that the nosocomial infection rate in the study was about 41.3 % , with 17 inpatients and 40 medical staff . given the high use of respiratory support to treat dyspnoea and respiratory failure induced by covid-19 , viral transmission through exhaled air should be considered . \n\n when oxygen is delivered through nasal catheter , mask or non-invasive ventilation ( niv ) , substantial exhaled air is released into the air , which can increase dispersion of the virus , and subsequently increase the risk of nosocomial infection . prior studies have suggested that the application of high-flow nasal cannula ( hfnc ) , niv through the specific mask with optimised vent holes or the helmet with a double-limb circuit may lower the risk of airborne transmission . performing non-invasive respiratory support in a single , well-ventilated , negative pressure ward is also considered a safe option . currently , however , the majority of patients are still receiving respiratory support through nasal catheter or common mask in general wards or emergency departments with limited medical resources . the potential for airborne transmission in this population has not received enough attention . furthermore , a significant proportion of suspected patients with mild to no symptoms who are managing at home may also require long-term home oxygen or niv treatment ( e.g . patients with advanced staged copd ) . these patients may increase the risk of family cluster infections by the widespread dispersion of exhaled air in their homes . \n\n non-invasive respiratory support plays an essential role in the treatment of covid-19 , and more awareness is needed regarding the increased risk of viral transmission from exhaled air . medical staff should utilise personal protective equipment when providing respiratory support therapy . patients should wear a medical mask when receiving conventional oxygen therapy or hfnc in order to reduce air dispersion . when performing niv therapy , because helmet resources are limited and they are not frequently used in routine clinical practice , we suggest avoiding masks with vent holes and adding a filter between the mask and the vent valve to reduce viral transmission . patient beds should be at least 1 m from one another and the ward air circulation rate needs to be increased . for patients with suspected covid-19 infection receiving long-term respiratory support at home , it is recommended that they stay in a single , well-ventilated room to avoid potentially infecting their family members . \n\n shareable pdf \n\n conflict of interest : l. guan has nothing to disclose .

00010010	early in the epidemic : impact of preprints on global discourse about covid-19 transmissibility \n\n since it was first reported by who in jan 5 , 2020 , over 80 000 cases of a novel coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) have been diagnosed in china , with exportation events to nearly 90 countries , as of march 6 , 2020 . given the novelty of the causative pathogen ( named sars-cov-2 ) , scientists have rushed to fill epidemiological , virological , and clinical knowledge gaps : resulting in over 50 new studies about the virus between january 10 and january 30 alone . however , in an era where the immediacy of information has become an expectation of decision makers and the general public alike , many of these studies have been shared first in the form of preprint papers : before peer review . \n\n for the past three decades , preprint servers have become commonplace in the scientific publication ecosystem , and covid-19 has prompted a seemingly unprecedented use of these platforms . although peer-review is crucial for the validation of science , the ongoing outbreak has showcased the speed with which preprints can disseminate information during emergencies . in this comment , we used both preprint and peer-reviewed studies that estimated the transmissibility potential ( ie , basic reproduction number [ r 0 ] ) of sars-cov-2 on or before feb 1 , 2020 to investigate the role that preprints have had in information dissemination during the ongoing outbreak . we also analysed the agreement of preprint estimates compared with those presented by peer-reviewed studies and propose a consensus-based approach for evaluating the validity of preprint findings during public health crises . for our analysis , we collected publicly available data from scientific studies , news reports , and search trends pertaining to sars-cov-2 and its r 0 . defined as the average number of secondary infections that a new case might transmit in a fully susceptible population , estimates of r 0 can provide decision makers with insights into the epidemic potential of a given outbreak . \n\n relevant news reports were discovered through mediacloud and search trends by use of google search trends , and both served as a proxy indicator for information dissemination . meanwhile , relevant scientific studies were discovered through a combination of searches executed with use of google scholar and , to address possible delays in indexing , four popular public preprint servers ( ie , arxiv , biorxiv , medrxiv , and social science research network [ ssrn ] ) that we believe are representative of the relevant preprint literature . search terms and specifications for each data source are outlined in the appendix ( p 2 ) . all studies discovered through google scholar , arxiv , biorxiv , medrxiv , and ssrn were manually checked for relevance to the topic area of interest . we retained only studies that included estimates for the r 0 associated with sars-cov-2 in the body of the text . \n\n r0 mean and range estimates from 11 different studies of covid-19 as a function of time \n\n for preprints that were revised before publication of the first relevant peer-reviewed study on jan 29 , the version number is indicated between parentheses as ( n ) . when multiple r0 estimates were presented in a single study because of the use of multiple approaches , the version number is followed by a single decimal place to indicate the approach used ( n.n ) . if a first author published more than one relevant independent study before feb 1 , the version number is followed immediately by an alphabetical marker ordered by date of publication ( nx ) . ranges presented vary by study ( eg , 95 % ci , 95 % credible interval , and so on ) and are presented in the appendix ( p 3 ) . r0=basic reproduction number . \n\n after this initial data discovery phase , which yielded 11 individual studies , date of first publication , publication platform , review status ( ie , preprint vs peer-reviewed ) , and methodological details were manually curated from each study ( appendix p 3 ) . r 0 estimates were also extracted from each study for further analysis . in the event of multiple r 0 estimates : because of preprint revisions after the first version or the use of multiple approaches in a single study : each estimate was recorded and treated as a separate entry to represent all available knowledge at any given point in time ( appendix p 3 ) . given that the first known preprint estimates for r 0 were posted to ssrn by us on jan 23 , we plotted search trend fractions and news report volume between jan 23 and feb 1 ( appendix p 4 ) . baseline data for both sources before jan 23 , 2020 , yielded negligible search trend interest and news report volume , and data collected up to feb 9 , 2020 , showed diminishing interest and volume after the catchment window ( appendix p 4 ) . to illustrate when each of the 11 relevant studies became available to the public , indicator bars were overlaid against the search trend and news report data by date of publication ( appendix p 4 ) . we then plotted each of the 16 r 0 estimates produced by the 11 studies , including both the mean and the estimate range ( eg , 95 % ci , 95 % credible interval , and so on ) presented ( appendix p 3 ) . estimates were plotted by date of publication and alphabetically there-in , offering a side-by-side comparison of preprint versus peer-reviewed results ; averages and 95 % cis were also computed for both groups ( figure ) . \n\n google search trends and mediacloud data suggested that both general ( ie , search ) interest and news media interest in the r 0 associated with covid-19 peaked before the publication of relevant peer-reviewed studies during the early stages of the epidemic . in the selected time frame , search interest peaked on jan 27 after a sharp increase between jan 23 and jan 25 immediately after the publication of five early preprint studies : all of which estimated r 0 : in biorxiv , medrxiv , and ssrn . meanwhile , news media interest peaked on jan 28 , coinciding with a sixth preprint study published in arxiv ( appendix p 4 ) . the first peer-reviewed estimates were then published by li and colleagues in the new england journal of medicine on jan 29 at 17:00 h ( eastern standard time ) , followed by four additional peer-reviewed studies in eurosurveillance , the international journal of infectious diseases , the lancet , and journal of clinical medicine up to feb 1 . average r 0 estimates across the preprint group were 3 61 ( 95 % ci 2 77-4 45 ) and 2 54 ( 2 17-2 91 ) across the peer-reviewed group : showing overlap in 95 % cis despite a wide diversity of modelling methods and data sources used both in-group and across-group ( appendix p 3 ) . although the average mean for the preprint group was higher than that for the peer-reviewed group , this effect was driven primarily by two upper-limit outlier estimates ( with r 0 higher than the 95 % ci maximum ; figure ) . exclusion of these two estimates by use of a consensus-based approach based on the 95 % cis yielded an average r 0 estimate of 3 02 ( 95 % ci 2 65-3 39 ) for the preprint group . notably , two studies in the peer-reviewed group had previously been published as preprints . although estimates presented by riou and althaus remained unchanged after peer review , estimates presented by zhao and colleagues were higher before peer review than afterwards . \n\n our findings suggest that , because of the speed of their release , preprints : rather than peer-reviewed literature in the same topic area : might be driving discourse related to the ongoing covid-19 outbreak . although our analysis focused on search trends and news media data as a measure for general discourse , it is likely that preprints are also influencing policy making discussions , given that who announced on jan 26 , 2020 , that they would be creating a repository of relevant studies : including those that have not yet been peer-reviewed . \n\n nevertheless , despite the advantages of speedy information delivery , the lack of peer review can also translate into issues of credibility and misinformation , both intentional and unintentional . this particular drawback has been highlighted during the ongoing outbreak , especially after the high-profile withdrawal of a virology study from the preprint server biorxiv , which erroneously claimed that covid-19 contained hiv `` insertions '' . the very fact that this study was withdrawn showcases the power of open peer-review during emergencies ; the withdrawal itself appears to have been prompted by outcry from dozens of scientists from around the globe who had access to the study because it was placed on a public server . much of this outcry was documented on twitter ( a microblogging platform ) and on longer-form popular science blogs , signalling that such fora would serve as rich additional data sources for future work on the impact of preprints on public discourse . however , instances such as this one described showcase the need for caution when acting upon the science put forth by any one preprint . \n\n with this in mind , taking multiple studies into consideration as presented in our analysis can help operationalise the kind of caution necessitated by preprints while simultaneously allowing for important , robust insights before the publication of a peer-reviewed study in the same topic area . here , we used a simple method in which we plotted the ten r 0 estimates that were posted as preprints before publication of the first peer-reviewed study on jan 29 ; we then took the average of these estimates and excluded the two estimates that qualified as upper-limit outliers : both upon visual inspection and as a function of the 95 % ci . even before outlier elimination , this simple method yielded average r 0 estimates similar to those presented by the peer-reviewed studies subsequently published on and after jan 29 ; however , more complex approaches that incorporate weighted averages based on estimate confidence , similar to traditional meta-analytical methods , offer a promising avenue for future work . such collective , consensus-based approaches will arguably be easiest to use when the research of interest is quantitative in nature ; nevertheless , given that many crucial epidemiological parameters that inform decision making ( eg , incubation period , generation time , and so on ) are quantitative , our proposed approach could work well in these contexts as well . \n\n our work showcases the powerful role preprints can have during public health crises because of the timeliness with which they can disseminate new information . furthermore , given that two of the preprints included in this analysis were later published in peer-reviewed outlets , the evidence shows that that even prestigious journals now permit the sharing of important findings before peer review and that the use of preprint platforms does not jeopardise future peer-reviewed publication . without question , primacy and peer-reviewed publications are key metrics in individual professional advancement ( eg , academic promotion ) ; nevertheless , the impact of preprints on discourse and decision making pertaining to the ongoing covid-19 outbreak suggests that we must rethink how we reward and recognise community contributions during present and future public health crises . \n\n references \n\n\n\n

10000000	clinical progression of covid-19 patient with extended incubation period , delayed rt-pcr time-to-positivity , and potential role of chest ct-scan . \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , previously called 2019-ncov , is a novel disease caused by sars- cov-2 which was first identified as outbreak of unknown respiratory illness in wuhan , china . covid- 19 was declared as global health emergency by who on march 11 , 2020 and quickly elevated to global pandemic on 11 march 2020 . covid-19 symptom is highly various in each patient , with fever , fatigue , shortness of breath , and cough as the main presenting symptoms . patient with covid-19 may shows severe symptom with severe pneumonia and ards , mild symptom resembling simple upper respiration tract infection , or even completely asymptomatic . approximately 80 % of cases is mild . however the number may changes as more people are getting tested . some experts are estimating that up to 50 % of all cases may be asymptomatic carrier . 
01100000	potential cytoprotective activity of ozone therapy in sars-cov-2/covid-19 . \n\n ( 1 ) background : the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) disease ( covid-19 ) in china at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak . systemic ozone therapy ( ot ) could be potentially useful in the clinical management of several complications secondary to sars-cov-2 . the rationale and mechanism of action has already been proven clinically in other viral infections and has been shown in research studies to be highly effective at decreasing organ damage mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress . this review summarizes the ot studies that illustrate the possible cytoprotective mechanism of action of ozone and its physiological by-products in target organs affected by sars-cov-2 . ( 2 ) methods : this review encompasses a total of 74 peer-reviewed original articles . it is mainly focused on ozone as a modulator of the nf-kappa b/nrf2 pathways and il-6/il-1beta expression . ( 3 ) results : in experimental models and the few existent clinical studies , homeostasis of the free radical and antioxidant balance by ot was associated with a modulation of nf-kappa b/nrf2 balance and il-6 and il-1beta expression . these molecular mechanisms support the cytoprotective effects of ot against tissue damage present in many inflammatory diseases , including viral infections . ( 4 ) conclusions : the potential cytoprotective role of ot in the management of organ damage induced by covid-19 merits further research . controlled clinical trials are needed . 
01001000	perspective from ecuador , the second country with more confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in south america : a review \n\n to face the pandemic outbreak of a novel coronavirus many countries developed a series of containment methods ; however , developing countries in south america had reacted apathetically to this worldwide concern . ecuador 's response to the novel virus coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) started on february 26 , 2020 , one month after the outbreak began in china . as of today , the countries with more confirmed cases in south america are brazil and ecuador . although brazil has two times the number of cases than ecuador ( brazil : 700 cases per 100000 people vs. ecuador : 400 cases per 100000 ) , the huge population difference between the two countries raises concerns about the public health policies implemented by the ecuadorian government . even though there is no cure for covid-19 , chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are promising alternatives . the covid-19 pandemic outbreak has shown that there is room for improvement in the healthcare systems worldwide and the disastrous results on the fragile often unprepared are those systems in developing countries . \n\n introduction and background \n\n alarm bells over the world started to ring after the news regarding a case of pneumonia caused by a novel virus in wuhan , china . the virus supposedly originated in one of the largest markets in wuhan . on january 7 , 2020 , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) isolated the virus and called it severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) . the disease caused by this virus was named coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) by the world health organization ( who ) . \n\n even though the majority of cases present with flu-like symptoms , 3.4 % of patients develop severe pneumonia , septic shock , respiratory failure , and multiorgan failure leading to a fatal outcome . \n\n on january 30 , 2020 , the who declared the covid-19 outbreak a global health emergency . countries applied many measures , hoping to contain the spread of the disease ; for example , restricting mobility and quarantines . additionally , incoming flights from countries with a high prevalence of the disease were suspended , first from china and then followed by italy and spain . \n\n in south america , brazil is the country with the highest number of covid-19-confirmed cases followed by ecuador . although brazil has two times the number of cases than ecuador , it is important to analyze the prevalence of the disease in the context of the countries ' population . while brazil , with a population of 212,559,417 , has a total of 1,549 confirmed cases ( 0.007 % ) ; ecuador , with a population of 17,567,751 , has 789 confirmed cases ( 0.004 % ) . the greater ratio of cases per population in ecuador raises the concern about the efficacy of the containment measures and public health policies taken by the country . \n\n the limitations of the healthcare systems in developing countries increase their chances of being affected more during a pandemic outbreak . \n\n review \n\n confirmed cases and ecuadorian response \n\n after the announcement that covid-19 was spreading rapidly across asian countries , european countries went into an alarm state and started to design containment measures while south american countries reacted apathetically , delaying decisions on preventive measures , underestimating the severity of the events . \n\n ecuador 's response to the novel virus covid-19 started on february 26 , 2020 . the set of measures included monitoring the temperature and other covid-19-related symptoms in travelers from high-risk countries . on february 29 , 2020 , ecuador confirmed the first case of covid-19 . the patient had arrived from spain two weeks before the diagnosis was made . \n\n after the who declared covid-19 as a pandemic outbreak on march 11 , 2020 , ecuador declared a national health emergency . all non-essential activities were suspended indefinitely and the use of virtual platforms was encouraged for academic activities , jobs , and medical care . as did other countries did , ecuador also closed its land , air , and sea borders to citizens and non-citizens for 21 days . restrictions to vehicular or pedestrian traffic and a national curfew from 7 pm to 5 am also took place . \n\n despite these measures , the virus continued spreading across the ecuadorian provinces . on march 23 , 2020 , 789 confirmed patients with covid-19 and 18 deaths related to the virus were reported by the ministry of health of ecuador . the mortality rate was similar to other countries . the number of confirmed patients increased , so did the number of people in epidemiological monitoring and quarantine . \n\n the infection risk in physicians also increases in countries with a high prevalence of sars-cov-2 . in italy , more than 3,000 health providers were infected becoming an increasing concern among health providers worldwide . in ecuador , 24 doctors have been tested positive for the virus one month after the first patient 's admission with covid-19 . the rising number of physicians testing positive for covid-19 raises concern amid a growing outcry over the shortage of protective equipment and medical supplies . \n\n guayas , with 607 confirmed cases , is by far the most affected province by covid-19 in ecuador . measures applied in the rest of the country with relative success failed in this province . the out-of-control increase in confirmed cases poses the risk of collapsing the health care system there . this situation led the government to declare the province as a national security zone , leaving operational planning to the army . \n\n transmission \n\n the transmission was described as animal-to-person in affected patients at the huanan seafood wholesale market of wuhan . at the moment , person-to-person transmission and fomite transmission have been linked with the spread of the illness . li compiled information on the dynamics of the novel virus , estimating a transmission rate of r0 2.2 for covid-19 . in addition , cascella mentions that close contact with an infected person is needed to transmit the virus . therefore , relatives and health professionals are at greater risk . \n\n there are some discrepancies about the transmission . while some studies support the animal-to-human transmission , including a case of a pet that tested positive for covid-19 , the cdc states that there is no evidence that pets can transmit the virus or present the symptomology of infection . \n\n prevention \n\n the main goal in the control of a pandemic outbreak is to achieve r0 less than 1 ( one positive patient can infect less than one extra person ) . to reach this goal , prevention is paramount . \n\n the who and cdc recommend avoiding contact with symptomatic people and agglomerations . basic hygiene practices , such as constant hand washing and the use of face masks in symptomatic patients , are also recommended to prevent the spread of the virus . \n\n many countries utilized quarantine and mobilization restrictions to control the spread ; however , these measures may not be sufficient in developing countries such as ecuador . \n\n pathophysiology \n\n the cause of covid-19 is a ribonucleic acid ( rna ) virus of the coronaviridae family called sars-cov-2 . although the exact pathophysiology of sars-cov-2 is unknown , its structural similarity with other viruses of the coronaviridae family allows an understanding of its dynamics and the evolution of the disease . the clinical presentation may vary from flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia similar to sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n channappanavar and granlinski mention that the most aggressive strains of the coronavirinae family , like sars-cov , have protein e in their envelope that stimulates nf-kb , a protein complex involved in cellular responses , including stress , cytokine signaling , response to viral infections , and apoptosis . protein e , along with other proteins , interferes with the host immune response ( tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) alpha and interleukin 6 ( il-6 ) ) . these processes produce uncontrolled inflammation , resulting in lung edema and fibrosis . \n\n treatment \n\n efforts to control covid-19 had been made by many countries , starting with investigations to develop a vaccine from the attenuated or inactive virus . the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases announced the beginning of the first trial on 45 volunteers between 18 and 55 years old . this first phase is estimated to last for six weeks . the kaiser research institute is evaluating the feasibility of the mrna-1723 vaccine . \n\n the management of patients with acute respiratory syndrome consists of assisted oxygen ventilation to achieve a saturation percentage of oxygen ( spo2 ) of 90 % and antipyretics . \n\n multiple drugs are being studied to treat covid-19 , with promising results . in the united states and china , a randomized clinical trial has been initiated to test the efficacy of remdesivir . at the moment , oseltamivir , a neuraminidase inhibitor , has been used more extensively . \n\n chloroquine , a drug used worldwide , has a promising effect in the treatment of severe pneumonia by covid-19 at a dose of 500 mg2 times a day ; however , zhou questions its use due to its side effects . instead of using chloroquine , zhou suggests hydroxychloroquine as an alternative treatment . hydroxychloroquine seems to attenuate the progression to more severe scenarios of covd-19 infection , although its dosage still needs further study . \n\n conclusions \n\n the low mortality of covid-19 may be the reason for developing countries underestimating the magnitude of this pandemic outbreak . the health care systems risk collapsing due to the increasing number of confirmed patients who need intensive care and the spread of the disease in health providers . the high demand for financial and human resources by this disease leads to a collateral increase in mortality from other causes . the covid-19 pandemic outbreak has shown that there is still room for improvement in healthcare systems worldwide to prevent its catastrophic impact , especially on the fragile and often unprepared systems in developing countries . \n\n the authors have declared that no competing interests exist . \n\n references \n\n cnn . ? cual es la tasa de mortalidad del coronavirus ?

00000100	covid-19 pneumonia with hemoptysis : acute segmental pulmonary emboli associated with novel coronavirus infection . \n\n recent retrospective studies from wuhan , china suggest novel coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) may be associated with a hypercoagulable state and increased risk for venous thromboembolism . the overlap in the signs and symptoms of covid-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) and covid-19 with concurrent pulmonary embolism creates a diagnostic challenge for emergency medicine physicians in patients already at risk for renal impairment . however , identifying features atypical for covid-19 alone may play a role in the judicious use of computed tomography angiography among these patients . hemoptysis is seen in roughly 13 % of pulmonary embolism cases and infrequently reported among covid-19 infections . additionally , the presence of right heart strain on electrocardiography ( ekg ) is a well described clinical presentations of pulmonary embolism not reported commonly with covid-19 infections . 
00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region , presented to the emergency with a 3-day history of headaches , dizziness , intermittent nausea , and vomiting . brain mr showed a tumor that was entirely confined within the third ventricle , causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the child has an uncomplicated recovery after surgery , and covid-19 was eventually ruled out after a 14-day quarantine . \n\n finally , we have some additional tips for conducting surgery under level 3 precautions . a comfortable goggle and use of antifogging agent are very helpful . in addition , surgeons should avoid unnecessary conversation and perform the surgery as gently as possible to prevent splashing blood in a negative pressure operating room . \n\n neuro-oncology patients may become infected with covid-19 , and thus surgery for these patients can not be avoided . as neurosurgeons , it is crucial that we do our utmost to care for our patients while ensuring our own safety at the same time . in these challenging times , we have faith that through our concerted efforts , this pandemic

herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region , presented to the emergency with a 3-day history of headaches , dizziness , intermittent nausea , and vomiting . brain mr showed a tumor that was entirely confined within the third ventricle , causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the child has an uncomplicated recovery after surgery , and covid-19 was eventually ruled out after a 14-day quarantine . \n\n finally , we have some additional tips for conducting surgery under level 3 precautions . a comfortable goggle and use of antifogging agent are very helpful . in addition , surgeons should avoid unnecessary conversation and perform the surgery as gently as possible to prevent splashing blood in a negative pressure operating room . \n\n neuro-oncology patients may become infected with covid-19 , and thus surgery for these patients can not be avoided . as neurosurgeons , it is crucial that we do our utmost to care for our patients while ensuring our own safety at the same time . in these challenging times , we have faith that through our concerted efforts , this pandemic

00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they

herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region

00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict

00001000	role of mask/respirator protection against sars-cov-2 \n\n to the editor \n\n since its outbreak on december 31 , 2019 , in wuhan , a central city in china , coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) has now spread to almost all countries in the world . it has been declared a pandemic , and it has infected over 1,041,126 people in a very short time , with 55,132 deaths as ofapril 3 , 2020 . wearing masks/respirators and practicingself-isolation at home have been recommended as guidelines for thepublic . however , the problem is the number of cases among medical personnel . interestingly , a higher risk of infection was noticed in male professionals . there are currently many types of masks/respirators available , ranging from simple surgical masks designed to protect wearers from microorganism transmission and fit loosely to the user 's face , through n95 masks used to prevent users from inhaling small airborne particles . these must fit tightly to the user 's face . masks differ primarily in their maximum internal leakage rate limit . surgical masks are designed to protect against droplets or particles with a diameter of > 100 mum , whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) virus is essentially spherical , albeit slightly pleomorphic , with a diameter of 60-140 nm and 100 times smaller than the pore diameter . thus , surgical masks can not prevent inhalation of small airborne particles ; however , both can protect users from large droplets and sprays . the pn-en 149:2001 standard defines 3 protection classes for half masks : filtering face piece 1 ( ffp1 ) , filtering face piece 2 ( ffp2 ) , and filtering face piece 3 ( ffp3 ) . the maximum internal leakage limit is 25 % for ffp1 , 11 % for ffp2 , and 5 % for ffp3 . class ffp1 masks retain about 80 % of particles smaller than 2 mum , ffp2 ones retain 94 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum , and ffp3 ones retain 99.95 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum ( table ) . \n\n test ffp1 ffp2 ffp3 concentration of harmful substances till 4 x nds till 10 x nds till 30 x nds leakage < 22 % < 8 % < 2 % penetration < 20 % < 6 % < 1 % initial expiration resistance at 95 l/min < 210 pa < 240 pa < 300 pa \n\n filtration efficiency for each class of masks \n\n abbreviations : ffp1 , filtering face piece 1 ; ffp2 , filtering face piece 2 ; ffp3 , filtering face piece 3 ; nds , the highest acceptable concentration of the harmful factor . \n\n at the moment , we may meet divergent recommendations for the use of masks . while the centers for disease control and prevention recommend the use of masks in low-risk and high-risk situations , the world health organization advises applying masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations . long et al conclude in their meta-analysis that the use of n95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza . they suggest that n95 respirators should not be recommended for the general public and non-high-risk medical staff who are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients . \n\n the potential of face masks to reduce the spread of respiratory infections could be useful . wang et al indicated that 10 of 213 medical professionals with no mask were infected by covid-19 as compared with 0 of 278 wearing n95 respirators . \n\n it is also worth noting that the respirator increases resistance to inhalation . the longer they are used , the more difficult breathing becomes because of more absorbed dust . what is more , the effectiveness decreases with the increase of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the respirator and face ( the so-called dead space ) . the concentration of carbon dioxide in the dead space increases with each subsequent exhalation . therefore , masks should be replaced frequently . additionally , to improve the comfort of use , masks use 1-way exhalation valves , which accelerate the circulation of gases.6 \n\n to conclude , the use of protective masks can and should be the first protection against sars-cov-2 transmission to medical personnel . medical personnel should use class ffp3 masks . additionally , the application of visors to cover the entire face during contact with the patient is worth considering . \n\n references \n\n association between 2019-ncov transmission and n95 respirator use . \n\n comparison of performance of three different types of respiratory protection devices . \n\n protecting healthcare staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome : filtration capacity of multiple surgical masks . \n\n a close shave ? performance of p2/n95 respirators in health care workers with facial hair : results of the beards ( adequate respiratory defences ) study . \n\n effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza : a systematic review and meta-analysis . \n\n cloth masks versus medical masks for covid-19 . 
00001000	emergency trauma care during the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in china \n\n background \n\n a novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in wuhan , hubei province , in december 2019 ; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans . china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease . however , a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking . to regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak , we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in wuhan . \n\n main body \n\n the article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 , indications for emergency surgery , and infection prevention and control for medical personnel , providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period . \n\n conclusions \n\n the measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of covid-19 . \n\n background \n\n a novel corona virus disease ( covid-19 ) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) began in wuhan , hubei province , china , in december 2019 . by february 13 , 2020 , more than 60,000 cases were confirmed , nearly 50,000 in hubei alone , and the source of the infection was yet to be definitely determined . the world health organization ( who ) has declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) . considering the current rate of human to human transmission , most countries in the world should be well prepared for the potential global covid-19 pandemic . china is on the frontline in the fight against the virus , and medical staff have become exhausted due to the excessive workload brought on by the outbreak . medical testing tools and personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , such as face shields , goggles , and gloves , have become scarce and have had to be rationed among teams and medical centers , with severe shortage in hubei , the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak . a report from a neurosurgery department of a teaching hospital in wuhan showed that from december 25 , 2019 , to february 6 , 2020 , eight covid-19 suspected patients were admitted , and three were confirmed . consequently , 12 medical personnel were infected ( 11 nurses and one doctor ) , among whom three had been in close contact with the first confirmed case . according to the data released by the national health commission ( nhc ) of the people 's republic of china , a total of 1716 medical personnel infections had been reported nationwide , accounting for 3.8 % of the total confirmed cases by 24:00 on february 11 , 2020 , of which six ( 0.4 % ) had died . of these , hubei province reported 1502 cases , accounting for 87.5 % of the total medical personnel infections , while wuhan city reported 1102 cases , accounting for 73.4 % . notably , medical personnel are the most valuable resource during the outbreak . how to protect them from infection is one of the foremost challenges in the fight against sars-cov-2 . \n\n although china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of sars-cov-2 , severe trauma can still occur . during the outbreak , the population of trauma patients may be diverse in terms of infection status , including patients who were previously healthy , suspected to be infected , confirmed infected , close contacts of infected individuals , and asymptomatic carriers . thus , balancing optimal trauma care while preventing further spread of the viral infection during the outbreak is a major challenge . \n\n to our knowledge , there is no relevant consensus or clinical guideline available on the indications of , timing of or perioperative protection during emergency surgery for trauma . to protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of trauma care , we have summarized the recommended perioperative infection prevention and control measures for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 based on current practical experience in china and the published literature on surgical practice during the past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) , ebola virus , and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n main text \n\n general principles \n\n special requirements for the hospitals receiving trauma patients during the outbreak \n\n emergency department : set up a triage area for assessment of all patients at admission , allowing early recognition of possible sars-cov-2 infection and immediate isolation of patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection in an area separate from other patients . \n\n radiology department : a dedicated ct room should be kept on standby for the examination of infected patients . \n\n operating room ( or ) : a relatively isolated negative-pressure or is preferable ; if there is no permanent negative-pressure or , a temporarily modified negative-pressure or the main operating suite of the hospital can be converted . \n\n intensive care unit ( icu ) : an isolated area should be prepared in the icu , and suspected patients should be treated in a single space . \n\n intrahospital transport : although an ideal trauma center with a door-to-door ct room and negative-pressure or are preferable in this situation , most regions in china do not operate such facilities . therefore , a predetermined transport route should be used to minimize exposure , and any intrahospital transport should utilize dedicated carts demarcated by a warning logo equipped with protective supplies and hand disinfectants . the patient should wear a medical mask , and the walls and the floor of the passageways and the elevator should be covered with a plastic lining . \n\n to control the spread of covid-19 , basic principles for treating infectious diseases should be followed , and necessary measures should be taken before receiving trauma patients . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n precaution level applicable personnel and scenarios personal protective equipment level 1 triage , emergency department clean non-sterile long gown , disposable head cover , disposable medical mask , and gloves . level 2 close contact with suspected patients , or handling secretions , feces , and personal items belonging to patients ; performing ct scan ( fig . 1 ) disposable head cover , gloves , disposable coverall , n95 respirator or equivalent , goggle or face shield , rubber boots or fluid-resistant overshoes , etc . level 3 close contact with suspected patients , or collecting blood , respiratory tract samples of patients , especially for endotracheal intubation , airway care , and sputum suction , as well as emergency surgery ( fig . 2 ) . on the basis of wearing secondary protective equipment such as goggle or face shield , other protective equipment should be strengthened . for instance , adding disposable surgical clothing and gloves in addition to disposable coverall and gloves . two layers of gloves covering protective clothing and surgical clothes sleeves , respectively , use of a powered air purifying respirator ( papr ) . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n to standardize and simplify the precaution measures and equipment required for different personnel and scenarios in trauma care , we adopted a three-level precaution protocol in trauma care ( table 1 ) . \n\n all levels of precaution were based on implementing standard precautions , including hand hygiene , respiratory hygiene , and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment ( ppe ) according to different risk levels . proper training of the standard donning and doffing procedures is the basis of effective protection . in epidemic areas such as hubei province , all patients can be regarded as potentially suspected patients during the outbreak , and the level of the precaution should be elevated . \n\n triage \n\n classification of the patients suspected cases clinical confirmed cases ( hubei only ) pathogenic confirmed cases diagnostic basis outside hubei province : two of the clinical manifestations with at least one of the epidemiological histories , three of the clinical manifestations without epidemiological history suspected patient in hubei province with ct findings of pneumonia suspected or clinically confirmed patients with at least one pathogenic evidence epidemiological investigation 1 . travel to or residence in wuhan in the 14 days prior to symptom onset ; 2 . close contactb with sars-cov-2 infection ( rrt-pcr positive ) within 14 days before onset ; 3 . exposed to patients from wuhan and surrounding areas , or from a community with patients who reported fever or respiratory symptoms14 d before onset ; 4 . clustering outbreak . - - clinical manifestations and ct scan 1 . fever and/or respiratory symptoms ; 2 . imaging characteristics of covid-19 ( ct : multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes in early stage , which are obvious in the peripheral lung , and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs , and lung consolidation may occur in severe cases ) ; 3 . the total number of white blood cells in the early stage is normal or decreased , and the lymphocyte count is decreased - - pathogenic evidence null null 1 . detection of sars-cov-2 in respiratory specimens and sera by rrt-pcr assays ; 2 . by virus dna sequencing , respiratory or blood samples dna sequence highly homologous with sars-cov-2 . \n\n diagnostic criteria of covid-19a \n\n covid-19 coronavirus induced disease , sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 , rrt-pcr real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \n\n athe diagnostic criteria were defined according to guidance for the diagnosis and management for covid-19 ( 5th edition ) released by national health commission of people 's republic of china in feb. 4 , 2020 \n\n bclose contact is defined as follows : \n\n - healthcare-associated exposure , including providing direct care for covid-19 patients , working with healthcare workers infected with novel coronavirus , visiting patients , or staying in the same close environment as a covid-19 patient \n\n - working together in close proximity or sharing the same classroom environment with a covid-19 patient \n\n - traveling together with a covid-19 patient in any kind of conveyance \n\n - living in the same household as a covid-19 patient \n\n trauma patients during the outbreak should be managed using the relevant contents in table 2 , and they should complete a brief epidemiological investigation at the triage stage . however , the trauma patients ' history may be unreliable , as they may not have time to be detailed . more emphasis should be placed on the objective data . during the outbreak in wuhan , a total of 32 emergency operations were performed in a tertiary care hospital , including 19 suspected and seven pathogenic confirmed cases . in addition , nine covid-19 patients in another tertiary care hospital underwent gastrointestinal surgery , but in all of these patients , covid-19 was diagnosed postoperatively . it is worth noting that there have been many cases of asymptomatic patients with an incubation period . the maximum incubation period was reported to be 24 days . \n\n evaluation \n\n trauma care is highly time dependent and requires rapid and effective evaluation and management . during the outbreak , primary and secondary surveys should be completed while maintaining the premise of effective protection . \n\n general principles of evaluation \n\n dynamic evaluation strategies should be conducted throughout the trauma care process . the personal protective equipment ( ppe ) worn by medical personnel may result in limited or incomplete physical examinations ( such as palpation and auscultation ) . therefore , injury assessment may rely on radiological examinations . \n\n radiology evaluation \n\n a chest ct scan is recommended for all severe trauma patients if there is no contraindication . if the chest ct scan is not possible due to critical condition , the patient should be treated as a suspect for infection until infection is excluded . \n\n level 3 ppe during ct examination \n\n if the hospital has a trauma resuscitation unit , complete x-ray including but not limited to the chest and focused assessment with sonography for trauma ( fast ) in the trauma resuscitation unit should be performed . for hemodynamic stabilization , a ct scan including but not limited to the chest should be performed ( fig . 1 ) . if the hospital does not have a trauma resuscitation unit , patients with hemodynamic instability should be resuscitated in the emergency department and undergo fast simultaneously . once the hemodynamic status is stable enough , the ct scan should be performed as soon as possible . \n\n ct scan protocol for trauma patients suspected of having covid-19 : medical personnel should first determine the method and scope of the scan , including but not limited to the chest , according to the mechanism of injury . for stab wounds , the segment and body cavity near the wound should be examined . for gunshot wounds , due to the high kinetic energy of the projectiles , the tortuous wound path , and the heavy tissue damage , the scanning range should be expanded appropriately . patients who have sustained blunt injuries with high energy , such as traffic injuries , should usually be scanned with enhanced scanning ranging from head to mid-thigh ( including the whole lower limb when there is lower limb injury ) . enhanced scanning is helpful in providing further information on organ injury , and three-dimensional reconstruction of blood vessels and bone should be performed when major vascular and bone injury is suspected . \n\n ct features of covid-19 : it should be noted that the pulmonary imaging changes of covid-19 vary depending on the patient 's age , immunity status , stage of disease at the time of the scan , underlying disease , and drug intervention . reports have shown that in the early stage of infection , ct shows multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes , which are obvious in the peripheral lung and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs . in severe cases , lung consolidation could occur . in addition , special attention should be paid to discerning between covid-19 infection and pulmonary contusion . \n\n blood and pathogen specimen collection \n\n if possible , nasopharyngeal swabs , sputum , lower respiratory tract secretions , and blood samples should be collected and sent for rrt-pcr in the emergency period . if no respiratory tract specimens are collected before the operation due to time constraints , they can be collected during or after the operation . \n\n all specimens shall be deemed to be potentially infectious . collection , transportation , and processing of any clinical specimens should be performed by biological safety training qualified medical staff . level 3 precautions should be adopted to minimize the possibility of exposure . \n\n the results of rrt-pcr may be falsely negative due to the influence of sampling , transportation , extraction , and testing . recent observations have shown that 30 to 40 % of patients with covid-19 ct features were rrt-pcr negative . as a result , the protection standard can not be lowered due to negative results . since the rrt-pcr test can take several hours to confirm the diagnosis , chest ct is recommended as the basis for the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 in suspected patients , especially in areas with a high incidence of the disease . the use of chest ct not only helps to control the spread of the epidemic but can also ensure definitive care for trauma injuries in a timely manner . \n\n emergency surgery \n\n emergency surgery is of great importance for severe trauma patients , the aim of which includes hemorrhage control , contamination abatement , and compartment pressure relief as soon as possible . effective prevention of sars-cov-2 transmission by standard intraoperative protective measures is an important indicator of a successful operation . from the available evidence , sars-cov-2 is spread mainly through respiratory droplets and contact , while aerosol and fecal-oral transmission are still under investigation . from the existing evidence and our practical experience , all medical staff should adopt level 3 precautions when entering the or . \n\n or preparation \n\n an independent negative pressure operation room is the first choice . operations can only be performed when the pressure is between - 10 and - 5 pa . if a negative pressure or is not available , a relatively isolated or with an independent purification system is an alternative option . nevertheless , the purification system should be shut down during the operation , and a final disinfection should be performed postoperatively . as in standard trauma protocols , the more critical patient should be operated on first . if two or more suspected or confirmed infected patients arrive in the or , a 30-min disinfection is warranted before the subsequent operation . the dedicated or should be clearly marked as covid-19 exclusive . \n\n the dedicated covid-19 or should be designed with a special passage and elevator . the design should focus on shortening the outdoor distance , reducing the chance of human contact , and limiting the time spent in suspected contaminated areas . materials and equipment should only be delivered by specially assigned staff . people inside the or are not allowed to leave during the operation , and outdoor personnel should not enter without permission . surgical articles should be clearly identified , and the use of disposable items is recommended . to maintain pressure , surgical supplies ( surgical instruments , dressings , single-use consumables , high-value consumables , medications , and relevant items ) should be well prepared in advance . only unidirectional flow is permitted ( nothing should be taken out once it is entered during the operation ) . personnel movement and the frequency of door opening are strictly limited . nondisposable items should be disposed of postoperatively in strict accordance with regulations . two suction apparatuses are optimal , one of which is for exclusive use by the anesthesiologist . the negative pressure aspirator should be immediately placed on the patient 's face to minimize the spread of respiratory secretions after entering the operation room . \n\n ppe for operation personnel \n\n protective clothing for surgical personnel : a after wearing protective clothing and inner gloves , b after wearing operating clothes and outer gloves \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe donning \n\n the topic of intraoperative protection remains controversial because most surgeons have no experience performing surgery while wearing heavy and airproof contagion gowns and goggles . according to practice in china , some medical personnel wore two surgical gowns , two contagion gowns and four pairs of gloves for surgery during the covid-19 epidemic . instead of enhancing protective effects , such excessive protection can reduce the visual , auditory , and tactile sensitivity of the surgeon , thus reducing the precision of surgical operations ( fig . 2 ) . the influence of excessive protection on the surgeon mainly includes ( 1 ) difficulty breathing , ( 2 ) fog on goggles and face shields that interfere with vision , ( 3 ) constriction of visual fields , ( 4 ) loss of flexibility due to multiple layers of gloves , and ( 5 ) double or triple the duration of the operation . a practical lesson had been learned from the case of a 7-year-old girl with suspected covid-19 infection who was subjected to an urgent craniotomy due to obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a third ventricle germ cell-derived tumor . the surgical team adopted a level 3 precaution including n95 respirators or papr , and full coverage with protective gowns ( shoe covers included ) and sterile surgical gowns . consequently , an operation that would have taken 2-3 h ended up taking 10 h. possible solutions for reducing the impact of ppe on surgery include reducing the or temperature ( minimizing the formation of moisture on goggles ) and enhancing the lighting in the room to obtain better vision . all ppes are fit for single use except papr . the steps of donning and doffing should be completed under professional supervision ( fig . 3 ) . \n\n anesthesia \n\n regional nerve block is the first choice for limb surgeries . general anesthesia is recommended for neurosurgery , torso trauma , or multiple trauma with shock . \n\n attention should be paid to avoid aerosol generation caused by coughing and other causes in airway operations . intubation should be performed after rapid induction and full muscle relaxation to ensure complete disappearance of spontaneous breathing , and sputum aspiration before intubation should be avoided . remote endotracheal intubation by disposable glide scope with an assistant is recommended . awake endotracheal intubation is not recommended for patients with a difficult airway , hypoxia , or unconsciousness . if face mask or laryngeal mask ventilation is able to maintain oxygenation , multiple tools ( fiberoptic bronchoscope , glide scope , light stick , laryngeal mask ) can be used to assist endotracheal intubation after rapid induction of general anesthesia . if not , cricothyroid laryngotomy should be performed without any hesitation . rapid induction via oral intubation is recommended in cases of a possibly full stomach . mask positive pressure ventilation after administration should be avoided . no emetic measure is recommended . extra caution should be taken on when a nasogastric tube is in place . covid-19 can cause pulmonary inflammation that can induce added lung injury , restricted crystal fluid , and protective ventilation . the proper mechanical ventilation parameters include limited tidal volume ( < 8 ml/kg ) and airway pressure ( platform pressure < 30 cm h2o ) ; 5-10 cm h2o positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation ( peep ) is optional for alveoli expansion and oxygenation maintenance . permissive hypercapnia is also acceptable . \n\n surgical strategy \n\n the concept of damage control surgery should be followed to simplify the operation . it is optimal to finish an operation within 90 min , and strategies such as packing hemostasis , external fixation , and temporary abdominal closure are helpful to shorten the operation time . surgical personnel should be highly focused and closely coordinated . gentle movement is essential to avoid accidental injury and contamination caused by the spattering of blood , fluid , and bone debris . limiting rinsing and drainage of bodily fluids is another key to effectively reducing intraoperative contamination . reliable hemostasis should be maintained to prevent bleeding around the incision . excessive negative pressure suction and violent operations are prohibited . it is also suggested that electrotome use is not suitable under this scenario ; if it must be used , the power should be minimized . smoke should be quickly suctioned to avoid aerosol generation . \n\n postoperative management \n\n postoperative management of patients \n\n after the operation , the patient should be transferred to an isolation ward in the icu . the endotracheal tubes should be removed under analgesia to avoid violent coughing while the patient is stable . sputum aspiration should be performed by a closed suction system . trauma and surgery can impair the patient 's immune function . clinically , some asymptomatic covid-19 patients suffered rapid deterioration after surgery . surgeons and anesthesiologists should be aware that acute lung injury caused by covid-19 may exist preoperatively or worsen postoperatively . therefore , special attention should be paid to the monitoring of body temperature , infection , and hemodynamic index . reexamination of chest ct and rrt-pcr tests is also important . for postoperative trauma patients with fever , traumatic , or operative complications should also be considered to differentiate them from covid-19 . attention should be paid to symptomatic and etiological treatment . postoperative dyspnea and hypoxia should also be differentiated from complications such as pulmonary embolism . nutritional support and prevention of other complications ( bacterial infection , stress ulcer , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , and deep venous thrombosis ) should also be strengthened . \n\n quarantine \n\n based on current experience , if the medical personnel complete the operation successfully and comply with all the regulations without any accidental exposure , the patient does not need to be quarantined . otherwise , a 14-day medical observation is obligatory , and timely treatment is needed when any abnormalities occur . notably , some literature recommends a routine 14-day quarantine for relevant personnel involved in the operation for sars-cov-2 confirmed patients . however , extreme safety often results in severe incapacity to help patients , so a balance between safety and efficiency must be maintained . \n\n discussion \n\n the national health commission of china initially decided to temporarily call the disease novel coronavirus pneumonia or ncp . it was not until february 12 , 2020 , that the official name covid-19 was announced by the who . shortly after the who announced the disease 's official name , the virus causing it was named sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , highlighting the new virus 's similarity to the sars virus identified in 2003 . based on epidemiological data up to jan. 4 , 2020 , the estimated r0 was 2.2 ( 95 % ci , 1.4 to 3.9 ) , while the latest study surveying cases up to feb. 14 , 2020 , further calculated that the r0 of covid-19 was 3.77 . therefore , researchers estimated that in terms of infection ability , sars-cov-2 was slightly higher than the sars virus and significantly higher than the mers-cov . according to clinical characteristic analysis of sars-cov-2 infection in china , the mortality was 2.01 % out of 28,018 cases as of feb. 6 , 2020 . by human-to-human transmission , sars-cov-2 had spread rapidly from wuhan , china , to 24 other countries as of feb. 12 , 2020 . the number of cases within china and other countries is rapidly increasing , and it is estimated that for every additional 10 % decrease in transmission rate , the peak population will be reduced by 20-47 % . the cumulative number of infected cases and deaths will be reduced by 23-49 % due to comprehensive interventions . if current interventions continue , it is expected that the number of people infected will peak in early march 2020 . based on the epidemiological analysis , only 1.18 % of the patients had direct contact with wild animals , 31.30 % of the patients had been in wuhan , and 71.80 % of the patients had contact with people from wuhan . common symptoms included fever , cough , and diarrhea . a total of 76.4 % of patients had radiologic findings manifested as pneumonia , with the remaining patients exhibiting normal radiologic findings . poor clinical outcomes can be predicted by disease severity , including oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count , and chest ct manifestations . \n\n the transmission by aerosols is still under investigation . aerosols are solid , liquid , solid , and liquid granular substances suspended in the air , such as dust , smoke , fog , and microorganisms . these may be the `` flying vehicles '' for covid-19 . covid-19 aerosols are related to the increased risk of covid-19 transmission . tracheal intubation , noninvasive ventilation , tracheotomy , manual ventilation before intubation , bronchoscopy , cardiopulmonary resuscitation , sputum suction , and other airway operations , as well as the use of electrotome , suction , and drainage , all inevitably produce a large number of aerosols . when carrying out these operations , the protection and training of medical personnel should be strengthened , and preventive measures to protect against aerosols are recommended , including n95 respirators , papr , goggles or face shields , disposable fluid-resistant gowns , and limiting the number of people in the room . \n\n based on experience from the hospital in wuhan , patients with covid-19 have high mortality after surgery . as of february 14 , 2020 , 6 gastrointestinal operations were performed in the general surgery department of the authors ' hospital ; one 60-year-old male died of respiratory failure 14 days after surgery , and one died of septic shock , for a mortality rate of 33.33 % . another group of eight covid-19 confirmed patients in zhongnan hospital of wuhan university underwent gastrointestinal surgeries ( seven gastrointestinal tumors and one benign case ) ; one patient died of covid-19 after left hemicolectomy with the diagnosis of postoperative recurrence of renal cancer involving the descending colon with intestinal obstruction , and one tumor patient died from postoperative complications of abdominal infection , for a mortality rate of 25 % . trauma patients usually have massive hemorrhage , shock , and contamination . damage control strategies should be complied with to correct fatal triads caused by hypothermia , acidosis , and coagulopathy . meanwhile , effective oxygen therapy and organ function support are also indispensable . \n\n moreover , additional attention should be paid to patients in critical condition and to those who develop severe pneumonia after trauma . among covid-19 patients , critical patients , including patients with respiratory failure , septic shock , and other organ failures , have accounted for 29 % ~32 % . identifying high-risk groups with severe illness can also help reduce the occurrence of poor prognosis . the possible high-risk groups include patients over 65 years old , patients with obesity , and patients with other diseases ( such as chronic pulmonary disease , hypertension , heart disease , kidney disease , diabetes , tumor , and immune deficiency ) . \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe doffing \n\n the covid-19 outbreak poses significant challenges to hospital staff and specifically trauma surgeons , which must offer optimal and timely care despite the circumstances . strict safety protocols must be adhered to when carrying out emergency care for patients with severe trauma and other surgical diseases , which means that all the measures shall be carried out to preserve the ability of the medical staff to achieve the purpose of effective care without sacrificing the safety of all involved . the perspectives in this paper can not be a substitute for clinical judgment and expert consultation but can help provide up-to-date guidance on the clinical management of emergency surgery for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 ( fig . 4 ) . \n\n conclusion \n\n in conclusion , the covid-19 outbreak raises several issues concerning the safety of medical personnel and patients . areas with high incidence rates of covid-19 should conduct operations with caution and protection should be strengthened while ensuring suitable facilities to carry out optimal care with maximal safety . with the accumulation of clinical experience and in-depth research , some of the practices may require modification when additional high-quality evidence emerges . the above is china 's experience in treating trauma patients during the covid-19 outbreak . we hope that this report will help hospitals worldwide prepare for future covid-19 outbreaks and infection control in unexpected conditions . \n\n abbreviations \n\n covid-19 \n\n corona virus disease \n\n sars-cov-2 \n\n severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \n\n

00001000	applications of 3d printing technology to address covid-19 related supply shortages \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) was first identified in an outbreak in wuhan , china on december 8 , 2019 . globally , the number of affected covid-19 patients is growing exponentially , with the death toll exceeding 27,300 as of march 27 , 2020 . worldwide , there is a limited supply of n95 respirator masks , face shields , ventilator valves , testing kits and other personal protective equipment . thus , adequate production and distribution of personal protective equipment is critical during this pandemic . to address these shortages , three-dimensional ( 3d ) printing , a novel and innovative technology used to fabricate complex architectures , is well suited . 3d printing is an adjustable , robotic platform allowing for tailored deposition of biomaterials using computer-aided design systems to formulate layer-by-layer custom designs with controlled architecture and composition . \n\n masks \n\n n95 respirators masks have two advantages over surgical , paper or cloth masks : 1 ) they are > 95 % efficient at filtering 0.3-microm airborne particles and 2 ) they are fit tested to each user to ensure an adequate seal , such that air and small droplets do not enter around the edges of the mask and into the health care worker 's breathing zone . the centers for disease control and prevention recommends n95 masks for health care workers taking care of patients with covid-19 . \n\n 3d printing can be used to produce tailored seal designs for improving mask comfort and fit . to customize face mask seals , 3d laser scanning can be implemented to scan exact facial parameters , with a tailored and customized face seal n95 template . anthropometric data of the chin arc , jawline , face and nose lengths , and nose protrusion measurements can be taken into account with this customized seal . in a study using face seal prototypes with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic using a fused deposition modeling 3d printer , three subjects showed improved contact pressure compared with use of 3m 8210 n95 ffr respirator masks . moreover , a personalized mask may account for facial hair length and density for a more precise fit . \n\n displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . the biomaterials displayed in this image have been fully characterized in the medical literature , with the same material composition of n95 masks . the mask includes several layers thereby ensure effective filtration of viral particles . \n\n figure 1 \n\n standard n95 masks consist of filtration material composed of electrostatic non-woven polypropylene ( pp ) fibers which are semi-rigid , lightweight and fatigue resistant . the semi-crystalline structure may cause significant distortion of the 3d printed parts upon cooling thereby making 3d printing difficult . material extrusion 3d printing was used to design a 3d printable thermoplastic elastomeric material from a blend of polypropylene ( pp ) and styrene- ( ethylene-butylene ) -styrene ( sebs ) . this blend provides better printability and flexibility for n95 mask design . pp is commonly used for various industrial applications due to its low cost , processability , printability , recyclability and mechanical integrity . sebs is a polymeric elastomer with low processing temperature and low distortion during extrusion . thus , the pp/sebs combination would improve the processability of 3d printed n95 masks . moreover , controlling the thermoplastic elastomer ratio allows for tailoring the flexibility and elasticity of the 3d model material for better fitted masks . 3d melt electrospinning printing can also be used to create pp microfibers with sequential layering to accurately obtain a 3d form . thus , 3d printing procedures may allow for the creation of stable and biocompatible n95 masks that are comparable to industrial manufacturing brands . figure 1 displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . \n\n face shields \n\n polycarbonate and polyester , polyvinyl chloride and other synthetic polymers are commonly used to make surgical face shields . these biomaterials are transparent , lightweight and provide high optical clarity . the polymers can easily be printed using 3d technology to meet the needs of healthcare workers treating covid-19 . \n\n covid-19 specimen collection kit \n\n creating 3d printed test swabs would help increase covid-19 testing capacity . nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs can be made from a flexible polymer , using polystyrene for the shaft . the tip can be tailored to be micro fine using computer-aided design software . thereafter , swab bud lattice fibers can be made from calcium alginate using hydrogels using 3d tissue engineering . \n\n ventilator valves \n\n ventilator valves are attachments used to deliver oxygen at fixed concentrations for patients with acute respiratory distress , including covid-19 patients . 3d printing technology can be used via a filament extrusion system or a polymer-laser powder bed fusion process to print single-use valve sets . 3d printers can design the different elements of the valve using biomaterials such as polyamide and polysulfone , polycarbonate , silicone rubber and stainless steel . furthermore , these disposable valves eliminate time-consuming sterilization . \n\n medications \n\n 3d printing techniques , such as fused filament , inkjet , extrusion and powder extrusion , allow for fabrication of 3d printed pills . medication-printing technologies typically utilize a small nozzle to lay thin disc-shaped layers of powders and deposit microscopic droplets of liquid to bind the materials . a coaxial needle extrusion 3d technology was used to print active pharmaceutical ingredients and create combinations of controlled dosing of drugs . while there are no specific antivirals or vaccines for treatment of covid-19 , several well-characterized anti-viral drugs are being considered as therapies . it may be possible to use 3d medication-printing technology to effectively and rapidly print lopinavir/ritonavir , chloroquine , and hydroxychloroquine pills . thus , 3d technology has the potential to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry , making drug research , development and production applicable to covid-19 patients . \n\n as the covid-19 outbreak rapidly evolves , there has been a personal protective equipment shortage globally . 3d printing inventions can be rapidly applied to address these deficiencies . cost , processing time , testing , and manpower are potential barriers to creating 3d-printed personal protective equipment . however , the synthetic polymer biomaterials needed for 3d-printed personal protective equipment are exact or very similar in composition to the standard manufacturing grade products ( i.e . n95 masks provides the same fluid barrier and air filtration protection ) . moreover , these synthetic polymer materials are readily available and cost effective ( i.e . polypropylene is 12.47 cents per pound ) . 3d printer costs vary but are an excellent investment with labor performed via robotics . in conjunction with flattening the curve via social distancing , this pioneering technology can provide adequate personal protective equipment for health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic . \n\n abbreviations : \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) \n\n three-dimensional ( 3d ) \n\n polypropylene ( pp ) \n\n

00010010	transmission potential of the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) onboard the diamond princess cruises ship , 2020 \n\n an outbreak of covid-19 developed aboard the princess cruises ship during january-february 2020 . using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members , we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak . our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore ( approximate range : 1.1-7 ) . our findings suggest that rt decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control . most recent estimates of rt reached values largely below the epidemic threshold , indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n introduction \n\n while the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) spread rapidly throughout china for several weeks since december 2019 , the virus had not taken off outside china in part due to the unprecedented social distancing measures that the chinese government put in place . one exception is the outbreak of covid-19 that developed aboard the diamond princess ship which was detected in early february when one of its passengers , a traveler from hong kong , tested positive for the novel coronavirus . the number of cases in the diamond princess ship quickly jumped to 454 confirmed cases by february 18 , 2020 . in contrast , the total number of cases in singapore , one of the countries with the highest number of covid-19 cases after china , was only 77 at the time . \n\n accumulating evidence indicates that the novel coronavirus can spread widely in confined settings including hospitals , cruise ships , prisons , and churches . in wuhan city , china , outbreaks inside health care settings led to the infection of hundreds of health professionals . in tokyo , japan , most of the reported infections have been linked to a party inside a traditional wooden ship , called yakatabune while most of the infections in korea have affected members of one church and one hospital . \n\n tracking the evolution of the transmission potential of covid-19 in different confined settings and how it compares with that of other respiratory diseases such influenza has public health implications . when outbreaks occur in confined settings , it is useful to investigate how the effective reproduction number changes as a result of interventions strategies such as the quarantine that the japanese government imposed on travelers and crew members aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n in this study we sought to characterize the temporal variation in the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak aboard the princess cruises ship using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data by dates of symptoms onset describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members . \n\n epidemiological incidence cases \n\n in yokohama , japan , an outbreak of covid-19 has been unfolding on board the princess cruise ship , which has been under quarantine orders since february 5 , 2020 , after a former passenger of the diamond princess ship tested positive for the virus after disembarking in hong kong . as of february 22 , 2020 , two days after the scheduled two-week quarantine came to an end , a total of 621 symptomatic and asymptomatic people including one quarantine officer , one nurse and one administrative officer tested positive for covid-19 out of the 3711 passengers and crew members on board . laboratory tests by pcr that prioritize symptomatic or high-risk groups have been conducted . \n\n incidence curves of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases of covid-19 among passengers and crew members of the outbreak unfolding aboard the princess cruises ship are publicly available from the national institute of infectious diseases , japan ( niid ) website . daily time series of symptomatic patients , from january 20 , 2020 to february 18 , 2020 were extracted . however , to reconstruct the trajectory of the epidemic , only 197 cases have dates of symptoms onset are available out of a total of 300 confirmed symptomatic cases . \n\n of the 103 symptomatic cases with missing onset dates , a total of the 79 cases are passengers while 24 cases are crew members . moreover , out of the 79 passenger cases , 30 cases were reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 21 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 28 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . of 24 crew member cases , 1 case was reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 15 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 8 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . \n\n epidemiological modeling \n\n we connected the daily incidence series with a discrete-time integral equation to describe the epidemic dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . specifically , let fs denote the probability mass function of the serial interval of covid-19 , where the serial interval is defined as the time from illness onset in the primary case to time of illness onset in the secondary case . then fs , of length s days , is given by \n\n for s > 0 , f ( s ) represents the cumulative distribution function of the gamma distribution . we characterized the expected number of new incident cases e [ ci , t ] in type i at symptom onset week t as follows , where rij denotes the average number of cases of type i infected by a single individual of type j . here we assume that the incidence , ci , t , follows a poisson sampling process with expected value e [ ci , t ] . \n\n the reproduction matrix for each type is given by \n\n this matrix is referred to as a next-generation matrix ( ngm ) in a fully susceptible population ( , pp . 873-885 ) . using this matrix , we derive the instantaneous time-dependent effective reproduction number , rt , for the entire transmission dynamics from the largest eigenvalue of the ngm . under the assumption that the per-contact infection probability and the generation interval are consistent over time regardless of the type of infection , the ngm quantifies the within type and inter-type patterns of transmission . the sum of the value in column j is the reproduction number for a specific type j . \n\n serial interval estimates of covid-19 were derived from previous studies of covid-19 , indicating that it follows a gamma distribution with the mean and sd at 7.5 and 3.4 days , respectively , based on ref .. the maximum value of the serial interval was fixed at 20 days as the cumulative probability distribution of the gamma distribution up to 20 days reaches 0.991 . \n\n we estimated model parameters and made projections using a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) method in a bayesian framework . point estimates and corresponding 95 % credibility intervals were drawn from the posterior probability distribution . all statistical analyses were conducted in r version 3.5.2

credibility intervals ( cri ) . \n\n total transmission includes within-type and inter-type transmission . \n\n our latest estimate of the overall rt is 0.35 ( 95 % cri : 0.02 , 2.19 ) , with only 2 % of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 . passenger and crew also have total ( within-type and inter-type ) rt values largely below the epidemic threshold , with only small percentages at 0 % and 9 % above the epidemic threshold , respectively ( table 3 ) . \n\n discussion \n\n this is the first study to assess the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak that unfolded aboard the diamond princess ship , january-february 2020 . the overall mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore in the range 1.1-7 . however , following the implementation of the quarantine period , the overall rt decreased substantially compared to values estimated during the early stage , but it exhibited fluctuations around the epidemic threshold , which likely prolonged the outbreak . \n\n our results indicate that rt declined following the quarantine measures implemented by the japanese government on february 5 relative to values during the early phase of the outbreak . importantly , only those passengers and crew who tested positive for the novel coronavirus were permitted to disembark the diamond princess ship , with more than 80 percentage of the passengers and crews still on board as of february 18 , 2020 . our latest overall estimate of rt at 0.35 ( 95 % cri : 0.02 , 2.19 ) with only 2 % of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 suggested a low probability of observing a subsequent outbreak aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n our findings indicate that the passenger-to-passenger transmission type dominated the transmission dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . the rapid increase in the overall rt from day 12 ( january 31 , 2020 ) to day 19 ( february 7 , 2020 ) is greatly influenced by the increase in passenger-to-passenger transmission , and this time period covers the time lag between february 1 , 2020 when the index covid-19 case was reported and february 5 , 2020 when the japanese government requested the passengers to stay inside their cabin after the detection of a cluster of covid-19 positive cases . upon the implementation of the quarantine orders , the overall rt and rt for passengers aboard the diamond princess ship declined thereafter , while rt among crew maintained a steady level and only started to decline on day 25 of the outbreak ( february 13 , 2020 ) . this is consistent with the fact that passengers staying inside their cabins led to a substantial decline in passenger-to-passenger transmission type except for their interaction with cabin mates . indeed , the proportion of secondary infections inside the cabins increased from 7 % ( 1/15 ) on february 6 , 43 % ( 3/7 ) on february 10 , 2020 to 100 % ( 1/1 ) on february 14 , 2020 . thus , a high proportion of the symptomatic cases after the quarantine gradually shifted from largely passenger cases to crew cases . indeed , despite their potential risk of acquiring the infection , crews had to continue to work to deliver services to isolated passengers . the distribution of the median re by transmission type suggests that other transmission types likely contributed to this outbreak to some extent ( fig . 3 ) . because one quarantine officer , one nurse , and one administrative officer contracted covid-19 aboard the diamond princess ship , the infection risk continued to be significant inside the diamond princess ship . \n\n as for the crude asymptomatic ratios by age groups , they show significant differences across age groups . however , these crude ratios are severely influenced by the timing of specimen collection relative to the infection time . hence , these ratios could be better ascertained if additional data with the timing of specimen collection becomes available . \n\n several limitations should be listed . first , a total of 103 laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases with unknown onset dates were not incorporated in our analysis . although the high proportion of unavailable data ( 34 % ( 103/300 ) ) likely influenced a downward bias in estimates of transmission potential , our estimates still point to the high transmission potential of covid-19 inside confined settings . second , it is possible that reporting delays could have influenced our latest estimates of the effective reproduction number . in fact , the us government recently sent a chartered flight to transport the american passengers on board the diamond princess ship , and after the disembarkation process , a total of 14 american passengers tested positive for the disease on february 16 , 2020 . this event also contributes to a downward bias in r although the number of cases does not exceed the peak of the outbreak , further supporting the potent transmissibility of covid-19 in confined settings . \n\n our most recent estimate of the effective reproduction number of the ongoing covid-19 epidemic on board the diamond princess ship was largely below the epidemic threshold of 1.0 , which suggested a very low probability of observing secondary outbreaks of the disease in the diamond princess ship . \n\n funding statement \n\n km acknowledges support from the japan society for the promotion of science kakenhi grant number 18k17368 and from

that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu

after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the

00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a

00001000	'let us help'- why senior medical students are the next step in battling the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n as senior medical students in the uk , we read dr stein 's letter on the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) 2 and began wondering where we fit in , in this pandemic . as the government heads into a 'war footing ' 13 , there is an increased need for medical staff . there is speculation of bringing back retired doctors , many of who fall into at risk categories . with clinical placement and exams cancelled , we are determined to use our hard-earned skills in some way , to help in what is the biggest global emergency of our lifetime . 
00001000	role of mask/respirator protection against sars-cov-2 \n\n to the editor \n\n since its outbreak on december 31 , 2019 , in wuhan , a central city in china , coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) has now spread to almost all countries in the world . it has been declared a pandemic , and it has infected over 1,041,126 people in a very short time , with 55,132 deaths as ofapril 3 , 2020 . wearing masks/respirators and practicingself-isolation at home have been recommended as guidelines for thepublic . however , the problem is the number of cases among medical personnel . interestingly , a higher risk of infection was noticed in male professionals . there are currently many types of masks/respirators available , ranging from simple surgical masks designed to protect wearers from microorganism transmission and fit loosely to the user 's face , through n95 masks used to prevent users from inhaling small airborne particles . these must fit tightly to the user 's face . masks differ primarily in their maximum internal leakage rate limit . surgical masks are designed to protect against droplets or particles with a diameter of > 100 mum , whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) virus is essentially spherical , albeit slightly pleomorphic , with a diameter of 60-140 nm and 100 times smaller than the pore diameter . thus , surgical masks can not prevent inhalation of small airborne particles ; however , both can protect users from large droplets and sprays . the pn-en 149:2001 standard defines 3 protection classes for half masks : filtering face piece 1 ( ffp1 ) , filtering face piece 2 ( ffp2 ) , and filtering face piece 3 ( ffp3 ) . the maximum internal leakage limit is 25 % for ffp1 , 11 % for ffp2 , and 5 % for ffp3 . class ffp1 masks retain about 80 % of particles smaller than 2 mum , ffp2 ones retain 94 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum , and ffp3 ones retain 99.95 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum ( table ) . \n\n test ffp1 ffp2 ffp3 concentration of harmful substances till 4 x nds till 10 x nds till 30 x nds leakage < 22 % < 8 % < 2 % penetration < 20 % < 6 % < 1 % initial expiration resistance at 95 l/min < 210 pa < 240 pa < 300 pa \n\n filtration efficiency for each class of masks \n\n abbreviations : ffp1 , filtering face piece 1 ; ffp2 , filtering face piece 2 ; ffp3 , filtering face piece 3 ; nds , the highest acceptable concentration of the harmful factor . \n\n at the moment , we may meet divergent recommendations for the use of masks . while the centers for disease control and prevention recommend the use of masks in low-risk and high-risk situations , the world health organization advises applying masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations . long et al conclude in their meta-analysis that the use of n95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza . they suggest that n95 respirators should not be recommended for the general public and non-high-risk medical staff who are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients . \n\n the potential of face masks to reduce the spread of respiratory infections could be useful . wang et al indicated that 10 of 213 medical professionals with no mask were infected by covid-19 as compared with 0 of 278 wearing n95 respirators . \n\n it is also worth noting that the respirator increases resistance to inhalation . the longer they are used , the more difficult breathing becomes because of more absorbed dust . what is more , the effectiveness decreases with the increase of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the respirator and face ( the so-called dead space ) . the concentration of carbon dioxide in the dead space increases with each subsequent exhalation . therefore , masks should be replaced frequently . additionally , to improve the comfort of use , masks use 1-way exhalation valves , which accelerate the circulation of gases.6 \n\n to conclude , the use of protective masks can and should be the first protection against sars-cov-2 transmission to medical personnel . medical personnel should use class ffp3 masks . additionally , the application of visors to cover the entire face during contact with the patient is worth considering . \n\n references \n\n association between 2019-ncov transmission and n95 respirator use . \n\n comparison of performance of three different types of respiratory protection devices . \n\n protecting healthcare staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome : filtration capacity of multiple surgical masks . \n\n a close shave ? performance of p2/n95 respirators in health care workers with facial hair : results of the beards ( adequate respiratory defences ) study . \n\n effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza : a systematic review and meta-analysis . \n\n cloth masks versus medical masks for covid-19 . 
00001000	emergency trauma care during the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in china \n\n background \n\n a novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in wuhan , hubei province , in december 2019 ; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans . china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease . however , a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking . to regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak , we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in wuhan . \n\n main body \n\n the article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 , indications for emergency surgery , and infection prevention and control for medical personnel , providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period . \n\n conclusions \n\n the measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of covid-19 . \n\n background \n\n a novel corona virus disease ( covid-19 ) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) began in wuhan , hubei province , china , in december 2019 . by february 13 , 2020 , more than 60,000 cases were confirmed , nearly 50,000 in hubei alone , and the source of the infection was yet to be definitely determined . the world health organization ( who ) has declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) . considering the current rate of human to human transmission , most countries in the world should be well prepared for the potential global covid-19 pandemic . china is on the frontline in the fight against the virus , and medical staff have become exhausted due to the excessive workload brought on by the outbreak . medical testing tools and personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , such as face shields , goggles , and gloves , have become scarce and have had to be rationed among teams and medical centers , with severe shortage in hubei , the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak . a report from a neurosurgery department of a teaching hospital in wuhan showed that from december 25 , 2019 , to february 6 , 2020 , eight covid-19 suspected patients were admitted , and three were confirmed . consequently , 12 medical personnel were infected ( 11 nurses and one doctor ) , among whom three had been in close contact with the first confirmed case . according to the data released by the national health commission ( nhc ) of the people 's republic of china , a total of 1716 medical personnel infections had been reported nationwide , accounting for 3.8 % of the total confirmed cases by 24:00 on february 11 , 2020 , of which six ( 0.4 % ) had died . of these , hubei province reported 1502 cases , accounting for 87.5 % of the total medical personnel infections , while wuhan city reported 1102 cases , accounting for 73.4 % . notably , medical personnel are the most valuable resource during the outbreak . how to protect them from infection is one of the foremost challenges in the fight against sars-cov-2 . \n\n although china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of sars-cov-2 , severe trauma can still occur . during the outbreak , the population of trauma patients may be diverse in terms of infection status , including patients who were previously healthy , suspected to be infected , confirmed infected , close contacts of infected individuals , and asymptomatic carriers . thus , balancing optimal trauma care while preventing further spread of the viral infection during the outbreak is a major challenge . \n\n to our knowledge , there is no relevant consensus or clinical guideline available on the indications of , timing of or perioperative protection during emergency surgery for trauma . to protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of trauma care , we have summarized the recommended perioperative infection prevention and control measures for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 based on current practical experience in china and the published literature on surgical practice during the past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) , ebola virus , and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n main text \n\n general principles \n\n special requirements for the hospitals receiving trauma patients during the outbreak \n\n emergency department : set up a triage area for assessment of all patients at admission , allowing early recognition of possible sars-cov-2 infection and immediate isolation of patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection in an area separate from other patients . \n\n radiology department : a dedicated ct room should be kept on standby for the examination of infected patients . \n\n operating room ( or ) : a relatively isolated negative-pressure or is preferable ; if there is no permanent negative-pressure or , a temporarily modified negative-pressure or the main operating suite of the hospital can be converted . \n\n intensive care unit ( icu ) : an isolated area should be prepared in the icu , and suspected patients should be treated in a single space . \n\n intrahospital transport : although an ideal trauma center with a door-to-door ct room and negative-pressure or are preferable in this situation , most regions in china do not operate such facilities . therefore , a predetermined transport route should be used to minimize exposure , and any intrahospital transport should utilize dedicated carts demarcated by a warning logo equipped with protective supplies and hand disinfectants . the patient should wear a medical mask , and the walls and the floor of the passageways and the elevator should be covered with a plastic lining . \n\n to control the spread of covid-19 , basic principles for treating infectious diseases should be followed , and necessary measures should be taken before receiving trauma patients . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n precaution level applicable personnel and scenarios personal protective equipment level 1 triage , emergency department clean non-sterile long gown , disposable head cover , disposable medical mask , and gloves . level 2 close contact with suspected patients , or handling secretions , feces , and personal items belonging to patients ; performing ct scan ( fig . 1 ) disposable head cover , gloves , disposable coverall , n95 respirator or equivalent , goggle or face shield , rubber boots or fluid-resistant overshoes , etc . level 3 close contact with suspected patients , or collecting blood , respiratory tract samples of patients , especially for endotracheal intubation , airway care , and sputum suction , as well as emergency surgery ( fig . 2 ) . on the basis of wearing secondary protective equipment such as goggle or face shield , other protective equipment should be strengthened . for instance , adding disposable surgical clothing and gloves in addition to disposable coverall and gloves . two layers of gloves covering protective clothing and surgical clothes sleeves , respectively , use of a powered air purifying respirator ( papr ) . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n to standardize and simplify the precaution measures and equipment required for different personnel and scenarios in trauma care , we adopted a three-level precaution protocol in trauma care ( table 1 ) . \n\n all levels of precaution were based on implementing standard precautions , including hand hygiene , respiratory hygiene , and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment ( ppe ) according to different risk levels . proper training of the standard donning and doffing procedures is the basis of effective protection . in epidemic areas such as hubei province , all patients can be regarded as potentially suspected patients during the outbreak , and the level of the precaution should be elevated . \n\n triage \n\n classification of the patients suspected cases clinical confirmed cases ( hubei only ) pathogenic confirmed cases diagnostic basis outside hubei province : two of the clinical manifestations with at least one of the epidemiological histories , three of the clinical manifestations without epidemiological history suspected patient in hubei province with ct findings of pneumonia suspected or clinically confirmed patients with at least one pathogenic evidence epidemiological investigation 1 . travel to or residence in wuhan in the 14 days prior to symptom onset ; 2 . close contactb with sars-cov-2 infection ( rrt-pcr positive ) within 14 days before onset ; 3 . exposed to patients from wuhan and surrounding areas , or from a community with patients who reported fever or respiratory symptoms14 d before onset ; 4 . clustering outbreak . - - clinical manifestations and ct scan 1 . fever and/or respiratory symptoms ; 2 . imaging characteristics of covid-19 ( ct : multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes in early stage , which are obvious in the peripheral lung , and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs , and lung consolidation may occur in severe cases ) ; 3 . the total number of white blood cells in the early stage is normal or decreased , and the lymphocyte count is decreased - - pathogenic evidence null null 1 . detection of sars-cov-2 in respiratory specimens and sera by rrt-pcr assays ; 2 . by virus dna sequencing , respiratory or blood samples dna sequence highly homologous with sars-cov-2 . \n\n diagnostic criteria of covid-19a \n\n covid-19 coronavirus induced disease , sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 , rrt-pcr real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \n\n athe diagnostic criteria were defined according to guidance for the diagnosis and management for covid-19 ( 5th edition ) released by national health commission of people 's republic of china in feb. 4 , 2020 \n\n bclose contact is defined as follows : \n\n - healthcare-associated exposure , including providing direct care for covid-19 patients , working with healthcare workers infected with novel coronavirus , visiting patients , or staying in the same close environment as a covid-19 patient \n\n - working together in close proximity or sharing the same classroom environment with a covid-19 patient \n\n - traveling together with a covid-19 patient in any kind of conveyance \n\n - living in the same household as a covid-19 patient \n\n trauma patients during the outbreak should be managed using the relevant contents in table 2 , and they should complete a brief epidemiological investigation at the triage stage . however , the trauma patients ' history may be unreliable , as they may not have time to be detailed . more emphasis should be placed on the objective data . during the outbreak in wuhan , a total of 32 emergency operations were performed in a tertiary care hospital , including 19 suspected and seven pathogenic confirmed cases . in addition , nine covid-19 patients in another tertiary care hospital underwent gastrointestinal surgery , but in all of these patients , covid-19 was diagnosed postoperatively . it is worth noting that there have been many cases of asymptomatic patients with an incubation period . the maximum incubation period was reported to be 24 days . \n\n evaluation \n\n trauma care is highly time dependent and requires rapid and effective evaluation and management . during the outbreak , primary and secondary surveys should be completed while maintaining the premise of effective protection . \n\n general principles of evaluation \n\n dynamic evaluation strategies should be conducted throughout the trauma care process . the personal protective equipment ( ppe ) worn by medical personnel may result in limited or incomplete physical examinations ( such as palpation and auscultation ) . therefore , injury assessment may rely on radiological examinations . \n\n radiology evaluation \n\n a chest ct scan is recommended for all severe trauma patients if there is no contraindication . if the chest ct scan is not possible due to critical condition , the patient should be treated as a suspect for infection until infection is excluded . \n\n level 3 ppe during ct examination \n\n if the hospital has a trauma resuscitation unit , complete x-ray including but not limited to the chest and focused assessment with sonography for trauma ( fast ) in the trauma resuscitation unit should be performed . for hemodynamic stabilization , a ct scan including but not limited to the chest should be performed ( fig . 1 ) . if the hospital does not have a trauma resuscitation unit , patients with hemodynamic instability should be resuscitated in the emergency department and undergo fast simultaneously . once the hemodynamic status is stable enough , the ct scan should be performed as soon as possible . \n\n ct scan protocol for trauma patients suspected of having covid-19 : medical personnel should first determine the method and scope of the scan , including but not limited to the chest , according to the mechanism of injury . for stab wounds , the segment and body cavity near the wound should be examined . for gunshot wounds , due to the high kinetic energy of the projectiles , the tortuous wound path , and the heavy tissue damage , the scanning range should be expanded appropriately . patients who have sustained blunt injuries with high energy , such as traffic injuries , should usually be scanned with enhanced scanning ranging from head to mid-thigh ( including the whole lower limb when there is lower limb injury ) . enhanced scanning is helpful in providing further information on organ injury , and three-dimensional reconstruction of blood vessels and bone should be performed when major vascular and bone injury is suspected . \n\n ct features of covid-19 : it should be noted that the pulmonary imaging changes of covid-19 vary depending on the patient 's age , immunity status , stage of disease at the time of the scan , underlying disease , and drug intervention . reports have shown that in the early stage of infection , ct shows multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes , which are obvious in the peripheral lung and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs . in severe cases , lung consolidation could occur . in addition , special attention should be paid to discerning between covid-19 infection and pulmonary contusion . \n\n blood and pathogen specimen collection \n\n if possible , nasopharyngeal swabs , sputum , lower respiratory tract secretions , and blood samples should be collected and sent for rrt-pcr in the emergency period . if no respiratory tract specimens are collected before the operation due to time constraints , they can be collected during or after the operation . \n\n all specimens shall be deemed to be potentially infectious . collection , transportation , and processing of any clinical specimens should be performed by biological safety training qualified medical staff . level 3 precautions should be adopted to minimize the possibility of exposure . \n\n the results of rrt-pcr may be falsely negative due to the influence of sampling , transportation , extraction , and testing . recent observations have shown that 30 to 40 % of patients with covid-19 ct features were rrt-pcr negative . as a result , the protection standard can not be lowered due to negative results . since the rrt-pcr test can take several hours to confirm the diagnosis , chest ct is recommended as the basis for the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 in suspected patients , especially in areas with a high incidence of the disease . the use of chest ct not only helps to control the spread of the epidemic but can also ensure definitive care for trauma injuries in a timely manner . \n\n emergency surgery \n\n emergency surgery is of great importance for severe trauma patients , the aim of which includes hemorrhage control , contamination abatement , and compartment pressure relief as soon as possible . effective prevention of sars-cov-2 transmission by standard intraoperative protective measures is an important indicator of a successful operation . from the available evidence , sars-cov-2 is spread mainly through respiratory droplets and contact , while aerosol and fecal-oral transmission are still under investigation . from the existing evidence and our practical experience , all medical staff should adopt level 3 precautions when entering the or . \n\n or preparation \n\n an independent negative pressure operation room is the first choice . operations can only be performed when the pressure is between - 10 and - 5 pa . if a negative pressure or is not available , a relatively isolated or with an independent purification system is an alternative option . nevertheless , the purification system should be shut down during the operation , and a final disinfection should be performed postoperatively . as in standard trauma protocols , the more critical patient should be operated on first . if two or more suspected or confirmed infected patients arrive in the or , a 30-min disinfection is warranted before the subsequent operation . the dedicated or should be clearly marked as covid-19 exclusive . \n\n the dedicated covid-19 or should be designed with a special passage and elevator . the design should focus on shortening the outdoor distance , reducing the chance of human contact , and limiting the time spent in suspected contaminated areas . materials and equipment should only be delivered by specially assigned staff . people inside the or are not allowed to leave during the operation , and outdoor personnel should not enter without permission . surgical articles should be clearly identified , and the use of disposable items is recommended . to maintain pressure , surgical supplies ( surgical instruments , dressings , single-use consumables , high-value consumables , medications , and relevant items ) should be well prepared in advance . only unidirectional flow is permitted ( nothing should be taken out once it is entered during the operation ) . personnel movement and the frequency of door opening are strictly limited . nondisposable items should be disposed of postoperatively in strict accordance with regulations . two suction apparatuses are optimal , one of which is for exclusive use by the anesthesiologist . the negative pressure aspirator should be immediately placed on the patient 's face to minimize the spread of respiratory secretions after entering the operation room . \n\n ppe for operation personnel \n\n protective clothing for surgical personnel : a after wearing protective clothing and inner gloves , b after wearing operating clothes and outer gloves \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe donning \n\n the topic of intraoperative protection remains controversial because most surgeons have no experience performing surgery while wearing heavy and airproof contagion gowns and goggles . according to practice in china , some medical personnel wore two surgical gowns , two contagion gowns and four pairs of gloves for surgery during the covid-19 epidemic . instead of enhancing protective effects , such excessive protection can reduce the visual , auditory , and tactile sensitivity of the surgeon , thus reducing the precision of surgical operations ( fig . 2 ) . the influence of excessive protection on the surgeon mainly includes ( 1 ) difficulty breathing , ( 2 ) fog on goggles and face shields that interfere with vision , ( 3 ) constriction of visual fields , ( 4 ) loss of flexibility due to multiple layers of gloves , and ( 5 ) double or triple the duration of the operation . a practical lesson had been learned from the case of a 7-year-old girl with suspected covid-19 infection who was subjected to an urgent craniotomy due to obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a third ventricle germ cell-derived tumor . the surgical team adopted a level 3 precaution including n95 respirators or papr , and full coverage with protective gowns ( shoe covers included ) and sterile surgical gowns . consequently , an operation that would have taken 2-3 h ended up taking 10 h. possible solutions for reducing the impact of ppe on surgery include reducing the or temperature ( minimizing the formation of moisture on goggles ) and enhancing the lighting in the room to obtain better vision . all ppes are fit for single use except papr . the steps of donning and doffing should be completed under professional supervision ( fig . 3 ) . \n\n anesthesia \n\n regional nerve block is the first choice for limb surgeries . general anesthesia is recommended for neurosurgery , torso trauma , or multiple trauma with shock . \n\n attention should be paid to avoid aerosol generation caused by coughing and other causes in airway operations . intubation should be performed after rapid induction and full muscle relaxation to ensure complete disappearance of spontaneous breathing , and sputum aspiration before intubation should be avoided . remote endotracheal intubation by disposable glide scope with an assistant is recommended . awake endotracheal intubation is not recommended for patients with a difficult airway , hypoxia , or unconsciousness . if face mask or laryngeal mask ventilation is able to maintain oxygenation , multiple tools ( fiberoptic bronchoscope , glide scope , light stick , laryngeal mask ) can be used to assist endotracheal intubation after rapid induction of general anesthesia . if not , cricothyroid laryngotomy should be performed without any hesitation . rapid induction via oral intubation is recommended in cases of a possibly full stomach . mask positive pressure ventilation after administration should be avoided . no emetic measure is recommended . extra caution should be taken on when a nasogastric tube is in place . covid-19 can cause pulmonary inflammation that can induce added lung injury , restricted crystal fluid , and protective ventilation . the proper mechanical ventilation parameters include limited tidal volume ( < 8 ml/kg ) and airway pressure ( platform pressure < 30 cm h2o ) ; 5-10 cm h2o positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation ( peep ) is optional for alveoli expansion and oxygenation maintenance . permissive hypercapnia is also acceptable . \n\n surgical strategy \n\n the concept of damage control surgery should be followed to simplify the operation . it is optimal to finish an operation within 90 min , and strategies such as packing hemostasis , external fixation , and temporary abdominal closure are helpful to shorten the operation time . surgical personnel should be highly focused and closely coordinated . gentle movement is essential to avoid accidental injury and contamination caused by the spattering of blood , fluid , and bone debris . limiting rinsing and drainage of bodily fluids is another key to effectively reducing intraoperative contamination . reliable hemostasis should be maintained to prevent bleeding around the incision . excessive negative pressure suction and violent operations are prohibited . it is also suggested that electrotome use is not suitable under this scenario ; if it must be used , the power should be minimized . smoke should be quickly suctioned to avoid aerosol generation . \n\n postoperative management \n\n postoperative management of patients \n\n after the operation , the patient should be transferred to an isolation ward in the icu . the endotracheal tubes should be removed under analgesia to avoid violent coughing while the patient is stable . sputum aspiration should be performed by a closed suction system . trauma and surgery can impair the patient 's immune function . clinically , some asymptomatic covid-19 patients suffered rapid deterioration after surgery . surgeons and anesthesiologists should be aware that acute lung injury caused by covid-19 may exist preoperatively or worsen postoperatively . therefore , special attention should be paid to the monitoring of body temperature , infection , and hemodynamic index . reexamination of chest ct and rrt-pcr tests is also important . for postoperative trauma patients with fever , traumatic , or operative complications should also be considered to differentiate them from covid-19 . attention should be paid to symptomatic and etiological treatment . postoperative dyspnea and hypoxia should also be differentiated from complications such as pulmonary embolism . nutritional support and prevention of other complications ( bacterial infection , stress ulcer , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , and deep venous thrombosis ) should also be strengthened . \n\n quarantine \n\n based on current experience , if the medical personnel complete the operation successfully and comply with all the regulations without any accidental exposure , the patient does not need to be quarantined . otherwise , a 14-day medical observation is obligatory , and timely treatment is needed when any abnormalities occur . notably , some literature recommends a routine 14-day quarantine for relevant personnel involved in the operation for sars-cov-2 confirmed patients . however , extreme safety often results in severe incapacity to help patients , so a balance between safety and efficiency must be maintained . \n\n discussion \n\n the national health commission of china initially decided to temporarily call the disease novel coronavirus pneumonia or ncp . it was not until february 12 , 2020 , that the official name covid-19 was announced by the who . shortly after the who announced the disease 's official name , the virus causing it was named sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , highlighting the new virus 's similarity to the sars virus identified in 2003 . based on epidemiological data up to jan. 4 , 2020 , the estimated r0 was 2.2 ( 95 % ci , 1.4 to 3.9 ) , while the latest study surveying cases up to feb. 14 , 2020 , further calculated that the r0 of covid-19 was 3.77 . therefore , researchers estimated that in terms of infection ability , sars-cov-2 was slightly higher than the sars virus and significantly higher than the mers-cov . according to clinical characteristic analysis of sars-cov-2 infection in china , the mortality was 2.01 % out of 28,018 cases as of feb. 6 , 2020 . by human-to-human transmission , sars-cov-2 had spread rapidly from wuhan , china , to 24 other countries as of feb. 12 , 2020 . the number of cases within china and other countries is rapidly increasing , and it is estimated that for every additional 10 % decrease in transmission rate , the peak population will be reduced by 20-47 % . the cumulative number of infected cases and deaths will be reduced by 23-49 % due to comprehensive interventions . if current interventions continue , it is expected that the number of people infected will peak in early march 2020 . based on the epidemiological analysis , only 1.18 % of the patients had direct contact with wild animals , 31.30 % of the patients had been in wuhan , and 71.80 % of the patients had contact with people from wuhan . common symptoms included fever , cough , and diarrhea . a total of 76.4 % of patients had radiologic findings manifested as pneumonia , with the remaining patients exhibiting normal radiologic findings . poor clinical outcomes can be predicted by disease severity , including oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count , and chest ct manifestations . \n\n the transmission by aerosols is still under investigation . aerosols are solid , liquid , solid , and liquid granular substances suspended in the air , such as dust , smoke , fog , and microorganisms . these may be the `` flying vehicles '' for covid-19 . covid-19 aerosols are related to the increased risk of covid-19 transmission . tracheal intubation , noninvasive ventilation , tracheotomy , manual ventilation before intubation , bronchoscopy , cardiopulmonary resuscitation , sputum suction , and other airway operations , as well as the use of electrotome , suction , and drainage , all inevitably produce a large number of aerosols . when carrying out these operations , the protection and training of medical personnel should be strengthened , and preventive measures to protect against aerosols are recommended , including n95 respirators , papr , goggles or face shields , disposable fluid-resistant gowns , and limiting the number of people in the room . \n\n based on experience from the hospital in wuhan , patients with covid-19 have high mortality after surgery . as of february 14 , 2020 , 6 gastrointestinal operations were performed in the general surgery department of the authors ' hospital ; one 60-year-old male died of respiratory failure 14 days after surgery , and one died of septic shock , for a mortality rate of 33.33 % . another group of eight covid-19 confirmed patients in zhongnan hospital of wuhan university underwent gastrointestinal surgeries ( seven gastrointestinal tumors and one benign case ) ; one patient died of covid-19 after left hemicolectomy with the diagnosis of postoperative recurrence of renal cancer involving the descending colon with intestinal obstruction , and one tumor patient died from postoperative complications of abdominal infection , for a mortality rate of 25 % . trauma patients usually have massive hemorrhage , shock , and contamination . damage control strategies should be complied with to correct fatal triads caused by hypothermia , acidosis , and coagulopathy . meanwhile , effective oxygen therapy and organ function support are also indispensable . \n\n moreover , additional attention should be paid to patients in critical condition and to those who develop severe pneumonia after trauma . among covid-19 patients , critical patients , including patients with respiratory failure , septic shock , and other organ failures , have accounted for 29 % ~32 % . identifying high-risk groups with severe illness can also help reduce the occurrence of poor prognosis . the possible high-risk groups include patients over 65 years old , patients with obesity , and patients with other diseases ( such as chronic pulmonary disease , hypertension , heart disease , kidney disease , diabetes , tumor , and immune deficiency ) . \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe doffing \n\n the covid-19 outbreak poses significant challenges to hospital staff and specifically trauma surgeons , which must offer optimal and timely care despite the circumstances . strict safety protocols must be adhered to when carrying out emergency care for patients with severe trauma and other surgical diseases , which means that all the measures shall be carried out to preserve the ability of the medical staff to achieve the purpose of effective care without sacrificing the safety of all involved . the perspectives in this paper can not be a substitute for clinical judgment and expert consultation but can help provide up-to-date guidance on the clinical management of emergency surgery for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 ( fig . 4 ) . \n\n conclusion \n\n in conclusion , the covid-19 outbreak raises several issues concerning the safety of medical personnel and patients . areas with high incidence rates of covid-19 should conduct operations with caution and protection should be strengthened while ensuring suitable facilities to carry out optimal care with maximal safety . with the accumulation of clinical experience and in-depth research , some of the practices may require modification when additional high-quality evidence emerges . the above is china 's experience in treating trauma patients during the covid-19 outbreak . we hope that this report will help hospitals worldwide prepare for future covid-19 outbreaks and infection control in unexpected conditions . \n\n abbreviations \n\n covid-19 \n\n corona virus disease \n\n sars-cov-2 \n\n severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \n\n

00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region , presented to the emergency with a 3-day history of headaches , dizziness , intermittent nausea , and vomiting . brain mr showed a tumor that was entirely confined within the third ventricle , causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the child has an uncomplicated recovery after surgery , and covid-19 was eventually ruled out after a 14-day quarantine . \n\n finally , we have some additional tips for conducting surgery under level 3 precautions . a comfortable goggle and use of antifogging agent are very helpful . in addition , surgeons should avoid unnecessary conversation and perform the surgery as gently as possible to prevent splashing blood in a negative pressure operating room . \n\n neuro-oncology patients may become infected with covid-19 , and thus surgery for these patients can not be avoided . as neurosurgeons , it is crucial that we do our utmost to care for our patients while ensuring our own safety at the same time . in these challenging times , we have faith that through our concerted efforts , this pandemic will be overcome soon . \n\n publisher 's note \n\n springer nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations . \n\n compliance with ethical

00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region , presented to the emergency with a 3-day history of headaches , dizziness , intermittent nausea , and vomiting . brain mr showed a tumor that was entirely confined within the third ventricle , causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the child has an uncomplicated recovery after surgery , and covid-19 was eventually ruled out after a 14-day quarantine . \n\n finally , we have some additional tips for conducting surgery under level 3 precautions . a comfortable goggle and use of antifogging agent are very helpful . in addition , surgeons should avoid unnecessary conversation and perform the surgery as gently as possible to prevent splashing blood in a negative pressure operating room . \n\n neuro-oncology patients may become infected with covid-19 , and thus surgery for these patients can not be avoided . as neurosurgeons , it is crucial that we do our utmost to care for our patients while ensuring our own safety at the same time . in these challenging times , we have faith that through our concerted efforts , this pandemic

00001000	role of mask/respirator protection against sars-cov-2 \n\n to the editor \n\n since its outbreak on december 31 , 2019 , in wuhan , a central city in china , coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) has now spread to almost all countries in the world . it has been declared a pandemic , and it has infected over 1,041,126 people in a very short time , with 55,132 deaths as ofapril 3 , 2020 . wearing masks/respirators and practicingself-isolation at home have been recommended as guidelines for thepublic . however , the problem is the number of cases among medical personnel . interestingly , a higher risk of infection was noticed in male professionals . there are currently many types of masks/respirators available , ranging from simple surgical masks designed to protect wearers from microorganism transmission and fit loosely to the user 's face , through n95 masks used to prevent users from inhaling small airborne particles . these must fit tightly to the user 's face . masks differ primarily in their maximum internal leakage rate limit . surgical masks are designed to protect against droplets or particles with a diameter of > 100 mum , whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) virus is essentially spherical , albeit slightly pleomorphic , with a diameter of 60-140 nm and 100 times smaller than the pore diameter . thus , surgical masks can not prevent inhalation of small airborne particles ; however , both can protect users from large droplets and sprays . the pn-en 149:2001 standard defines 3 protection classes for half masks : filtering face piece 1 ( ffp1 ) , filtering face piece 2 ( ffp2 ) , and filtering face piece 3 ( ffp3 ) . the maximum internal leakage limit is 25 % for ffp1 , 11 % for ffp2 , and 5 % for ffp3 . class ffp1 masks retain about 80 % of particles smaller than 2 mum , ffp2 ones retain 94 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum , and ffp3 ones retain 99.95 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum ( table ) . \n\n test ffp1 ffp2 ffp3 concentration of harmful substances till 4 x nds till 10 x nds till 30 x nds leakage < 22 % < 8 % < 2 % penetration < 20 % < 6 % < 1 % initial expiration resistance at 95 l/min < 210 pa < 240 pa < 300 pa \n\n filtration efficiency for each class of masks \n\n abbreviations : ffp1 , filtering face piece 1 ; ffp2 , filtering face piece 2 ; ffp3 , filtering face piece 3 ; nds , the highest acceptable concentration of the harmful factor . \n\n at the moment , we may meet divergent recommendations for the use of masks . while the centers for disease control and prevention recommend the use of masks in low-risk and high-risk situations , the world health organization advises applying masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations . long et al conclude in their meta-analysis that the use of n95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza . they suggest that n95 respirators should not be recommended for the general public and non-high-risk medical staff who are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients . \n\n the potential of face masks to reduce the spread of respiratory infections could be useful . wang et al indicated that 10 of 213 medical professionals with no mask were infected by covid-19 as compared with 0 of 278 wearing n95 respirators . \n\n it is also worth noting that the respirator increases resistance to inhalation . the longer they are used , the more difficult breathing becomes because of more absorbed dust . what is more , the effectiveness decreases with the increase of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the respirator and face ( the so-called dead space ) . the concentration of carbon dioxide in the dead space increases with each subsequent exhalation . therefore , masks should be replaced frequently . additionally , to improve the comfort of use , masks use 1-way exhalation valves , which accelerate the circulation of gases.6 \n\n to conclude , the use of protective masks can and should be the first protection against sars-cov-2 transmission to medical personnel . medical personnel should use class ffp3 masks . additionally , the application of visors to cover the entire face during contact with the patient is worth considering . \n\n references \n\n association between 2019-ncov transmission and n95 respirator use . \n\n comparison of performance of three different types of respiratory protection devices . \n\n protecting healthcare staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome : filtration capacity of multiple surgical masks . \n\n a close shave ? performance of p2/n95 respirators in health care workers with facial hair : results of the beards ( adequate respiratory defences ) study . \n\n effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza : a systematic review and meta-analysis . \n\n cloth masks versus medical masks for covid-19 . 
00001000	emergency trauma care during the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in china \n\n background \n\n a novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in wuhan , hubei province , in december 2019 ; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans . china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease . however , a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking . to regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak , we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in wuhan . \n\n main body \n\n the article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 , indications for emergency surgery , and infection prevention and control for medical personnel , providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period . \n\n conclusions \n\n the measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of covid-19 . \n\n background \n\n a novel corona virus disease ( covid-19 ) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) began in wuhan , hubei province , china , in december 2019 . by february 13 , 2020 , more than 60,000 cases were confirmed , nearly 50,000 in hubei alone , and the source of the infection was yet to be definitely determined . the world health organization ( who ) has declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) . considering the current rate of human to human transmission , most countries in the world should be well prepared for the potential global covid-19 pandemic . china is on the frontline in the fight against the virus , and medical staff have become exhausted due to the excessive workload brought on by the outbreak . medical testing tools and personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , such as face shields , goggles , and gloves , have become scarce and have had to be rationed among teams and medical centers , with severe shortage in hubei , the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak . a report from a neurosurgery department of a teaching hospital in wuhan showed that from december 25 , 2019 , to february 6 , 2020 , eight covid-19 suspected patients were admitted , and three were confirmed . consequently , 12 medical personnel were infected ( 11 nurses and one doctor ) , among whom three had been in close contact with the first confirmed case . according to the data released by the national health commission ( nhc ) of the people 's republic of china , a total of 1716 medical personnel infections had been reported nationwide , accounting for 3.8 % of the total confirmed cases by 24:00 on february 11 , 2020 , of which six ( 0.4 % ) had died . of these , hubei province reported 1502 cases , accounting for 87.5 % of the total medical personnel infections , while wuhan city reported 1102 cases , accounting for 73.4 % . notably , medical personnel are the most valuable resource during the outbreak . how to protect them from infection is one of the foremost challenges in the fight against sars-cov-2 . \n\n although china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of sars-cov-2 , severe trauma can still occur . during the outbreak , the population of trauma patients may be diverse in terms of infection status , including patients who were previously healthy , suspected to be infected , confirmed infected , close contacts of infected individuals , and asymptomatic carriers . thus , balancing optimal trauma care while preventing further spread of the viral infection during the outbreak is a major challenge . \n\n to our knowledge , there is no relevant consensus or clinical guideline available on the indications of , timing of or perioperative protection during emergency surgery for trauma . to protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of trauma care , we have summarized the recommended perioperative infection prevention and control measures for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 based on current practical experience in china and the published literature on surgical practice during the past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) , ebola virus , and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n main text \n\n general principles \n\n special requirements for the hospitals receiving trauma patients during the outbreak \n\n emergency department : set up a triage area for assessment of all patients at admission , allowing early recognition of possible sars-cov-2 infection and immediate isolation of patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection in an area separate from other patients . \n\n radiology department : a dedicated ct room should be kept on standby for the examination of infected patients . \n\n operating room ( or ) : a relatively isolated negative-pressure or is preferable ; if there is no permanent negative-pressure or , a temporarily modified negative-pressure or the main operating suite of the hospital can be converted . \n\n intensive care unit ( icu ) : an isolated area should be prepared in the icu , and suspected patients should be treated in a single space . \n\n intrahospital transport : although an ideal trauma center with a door-to-door ct room and negative-pressure or are preferable in this situation , most regions in china do not operate such facilities . therefore , a predetermined transport route should be used to minimize exposure , and any intrahospital transport should utilize dedicated carts demarcated by a warning logo equipped with protective supplies and hand disinfectants . the patient should wear a medical mask , and the walls and the floor of the passageways and the elevator should be covered with a plastic lining . \n\n to control the spread of covid-19 , basic principles for treating infectious diseases should be followed , and necessary measures should be taken before receiving trauma patients . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n precaution level applicable personnel and scenarios personal protective equipment level 1 triage , emergency department clean non-sterile long gown , disposable head cover , disposable medical mask , and gloves . level 2 close contact with suspected patients , or handling secretions , feces , and personal items belonging to patients ; performing ct scan ( fig . 1 ) disposable head cover , gloves , disposable coverall , n95 respirator or equivalent , goggle or face shield , rubber boots or fluid-resistant overshoes , etc . level 3 close contact with suspected patients , or collecting blood , respiratory tract samples of patients , especially for endotracheal intubation , airway care , and sputum suction , as well as emergency surgery ( fig . 2 ) . on the basis of wearing secondary protective equipment such as goggle or face shield , other protective equipment should be strengthened . for instance , adding disposable surgical clothing and gloves in addition to disposable coverall and gloves . two layers of gloves covering protective clothing and surgical clothes sleeves , respectively , use of a powered air purifying respirator ( papr ) . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n to standardize and simplify the precaution measures and equipment required for different personnel and scenarios in trauma care , we adopted a three-level precaution protocol in trauma care ( table 1 ) . \n\n all levels of precaution were based on implementing standard precautions , including hand hygiene , respiratory hygiene , and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment ( ppe ) according to different risk levels . proper training of the standard donning and doffing procedures is the basis of effective protection . in epidemic areas such as hubei province , all patients can be regarded as potentially suspected patients during the outbreak , and the level of the precaution should be elevated . \n\n triage \n\n classification of the patients suspected cases clinical confirmed cases ( hubei only ) pathogenic confirmed cases diagnostic basis outside hubei province : two of the clinical manifestations with at least one of the epidemiological histories , three of the clinical manifestations without epidemiological history suspected patient in hubei province with ct findings of pneumonia suspected or clinically confirmed patients with at least one pathogenic evidence epidemiological investigation 1 . travel to or residence in wuhan in the 14 days prior to symptom onset ; 2 . close contactb with sars-cov-2 infection ( rrt-pcr positive ) within 14 days before onset ; 3 . exposed to patients from wuhan and surrounding areas , or from a community with patients who reported fever or respiratory symptoms14 d before onset ; 4 . clustering outbreak . - - clinical manifestations and ct scan 1 . fever and/or respiratory symptoms ; 2 . imaging characteristics of covid-19 ( ct : multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes in early stage , which are obvious in the peripheral lung , and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs , and lung consolidation may occur in severe cases ) ; 3 . the total number of white blood cells in the early stage is normal or decreased , and the lymphocyte count is decreased - - pathogenic evidence null null 1 . detection of sars-cov-2 in respiratory specimens and sera by rrt-pcr assays ; 2 . by virus dna sequencing , respiratory or blood samples dna sequence highly homologous with sars-cov-2 . \n\n diagnostic criteria of covid-19a \n\n covid-19 coronavirus induced disease , sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 , rrt-pcr real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \n\n athe diagnostic criteria were defined according to guidance for the diagnosis and management for covid-19 ( 5th edition ) released by national health commission of people 's republic of china in feb. 4 , 2020 \n\n bclose contact is defined as follows : \n\n - healthcare-associated exposure , including providing direct care for covid-19 patients , working with healthcare workers infected with novel coronavirus , visiting patients , or staying in the same close environment as a covid-19 patient \n\n - working together in close proximity or sharing the same classroom environment with a covid-19 patient \n\n - traveling together with a covid-19 patient in any kind of conveyance \n\n - living in the same household as a covid-19 patient \n\n trauma patients during the outbreak should be managed using the relevant contents in table 2 , and they should complete a brief epidemiological investigation at the triage stage . however , the trauma patients ' history may be unreliable , as they may not have time to be detailed . more emphasis should be placed on the objective data . during the outbreak in wuhan , a total of 32 emergency operations were performed in a tertiary care hospital , including 19 suspected and seven pathogenic confirmed cases . in addition , nine covid-19 patients in another tertiary care hospital underwent gastrointestinal surgery , but in all of these patients , covid-19 was diagnosed postoperatively . it is worth noting that there have been many cases of asymptomatic patients with an incubation period . the maximum incubation period was reported to be 24 days . \n\n evaluation \n\n trauma care is highly time dependent and requires rapid and effective evaluation and management . during the outbreak , primary and secondary surveys should be completed while maintaining the premise of effective protection . \n\n general principles of evaluation \n\n dynamic evaluation strategies should be conducted throughout the trauma care process . the personal protective equipment ( ppe ) worn by medical personnel may result in limited or incomplete physical examinations ( such as palpation and auscultation ) . therefore , injury assessment may rely on radiological examinations . \n\n radiology evaluation \n\n a chest ct scan is recommended for all severe trauma patients if there is no contraindication . if the chest ct scan is not possible due to critical condition , the patient should be treated as a suspect for infection until infection is excluded . \n\n level 3 ppe during ct examination \n\n if the hospital has a trauma resuscitation unit , complete x-ray including but not limited to the chest and focused assessment with sonography for trauma ( fast ) in the trauma resuscitation unit should be performed . for hemodynamic stabilization , a ct scan including but not limited to the chest should be performed ( fig . 1 ) . if the hospital does not have a trauma resuscitation unit , patients with hemodynamic instability should be resuscitated in the emergency department and undergo fast simultaneously . once the hemodynamic status is stable enough , the ct scan should be performed as soon as possible . \n\n ct scan protocol for trauma patients suspected of having covid-19 : medical personnel should first determine the method and scope of the scan , including but not limited to the chest , according to the mechanism of injury . for stab wounds , the segment and body cavity near the wound should be examined . for gunshot wounds , due to the high kinetic energy of the projectiles , the tortuous wound path , and the heavy tissue damage , the scanning range should be expanded appropriately . patients who have sustained blunt injuries with high energy , such as traffic injuries , should usually be scanned with enhanced scanning ranging from head to mid-thigh ( including the whole lower limb when there is lower limb injury ) . enhanced scanning is helpful in providing further information on organ injury , and three-dimensional reconstruction of blood vessels and bone should be performed when major vascular and bone injury is suspected . \n\n ct features of covid-19 : it should be noted that the pulmonary imaging changes of covid-19 vary depending on the patient 's age , immunity status , stage of disease at the time of the scan , underlying disease , and drug intervention . reports have shown that in the early stage of infection , ct shows multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes , which are obvious in the peripheral lung and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs . in severe cases , lung consolidation could occur . in addition , special attention should be paid to discerning between covid-19 infection and pulmonary contusion . \n\n blood and pathogen specimen collection \n\n if possible , nasopharyngeal swabs , sputum , lower respiratory tract secretions , and blood samples should be collected and sent for rrt-pcr in the emergency period . if no respiratory tract specimens are collected before the operation due to time constraints , they can be collected during or after the operation . \n\n all specimens shall be deemed to be potentially infectious . collection , transportation , and processing of any clinical specimens should be performed by biological safety training qualified medical staff . level 3 precautions should be adopted to minimize the possibility of exposure . \n\n the results of rrt-pcr may be falsely negative due to the influence of sampling , transportation , extraction , and testing . recent observations have shown that 30 to 40 % of patients with covid-19 ct features were rrt-pcr negative . as a result , the protection standard can not be lowered due to negative results . since the rrt-pcr test can take several hours to confirm the diagnosis , chest ct is recommended as the basis for the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 in suspected patients , especially in areas with a high incidence of the disease . the use of chest ct not only helps to control the spread of the epidemic but can also ensure definitive care for trauma injuries in a timely manner . \n\n emergency surgery \n\n emergency surgery is of great importance for severe trauma patients , the aim of which includes hemorrhage control , contamination abatement , and compartment pressure relief as soon as possible . effective prevention of sars-cov-2 transmission by standard intraoperative protective measures is an important indicator of a successful operation . from the available evidence , sars-cov-2 is spread mainly through respiratory droplets and contact , while aerosol and fecal-oral transmission are still under investigation . from the existing evidence and our practical experience , all medical staff should adopt level 3 precautions when entering the or . \n\n or preparation \n\n an independent negative pressure operation room is the first choice . operations can only be performed when the pressure is between - 10 and - 5 pa . if a negative pressure or is not available , a relatively isolated or with an independent purification system is an alternative option . nevertheless , the purification system should be shut down during the operation , and a final disinfection should be performed postoperatively . as in standard trauma protocols , the more critical patient should be operated on first . if two or more suspected or confirmed infected patients arrive in the or , a 30-min disinfection is warranted before the subsequent operation . the dedicated or should be clearly marked as covid-19 exclusive . \n\n the dedicated covid-19 or should be designed with a special passage and elevator . the design should focus on shortening the outdoor distance , reducing the chance of human contact , and limiting the time spent in suspected contaminated areas . materials and equipment should only be delivered by specially assigned staff . people inside the or are not allowed to leave during the operation , and outdoor personnel should not enter without permission . surgical articles should be clearly identified , and the use of disposable items is recommended . to maintain pressure , surgical supplies ( surgical instruments , dressings , single-use consumables , high-value consumables , medications , and relevant items ) should be well prepared in advance . only unidirectional flow is permitted ( nothing should be taken out once it is entered during the operation ) . personnel movement and the frequency of door opening are strictly limited . nondisposable items should be disposed of postoperatively in strict accordance with regulations . two suction apparatuses are optimal , one of which is for exclusive use by the anesthesiologist . the negative pressure aspirator should be immediately placed on the patient 's face to minimize the spread of respiratory secretions after entering the operation room . \n\n ppe for operation personnel \n\n protective clothing for surgical personnel : a after wearing protective clothing and inner gloves , b after wearing operating clothes and outer gloves \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe donning \n\n the topic of intraoperative protection remains controversial because most surgeons have no experience performing surgery while wearing heavy and airproof contagion gowns and goggles . according to practice in china , some medical personnel wore two surgical gowns , two contagion gowns and four pairs of gloves for surgery during the covid-19 epidemic . instead of enhancing protective effects , such excessive protection can reduce the visual , auditory , and tactile sensitivity of the surgeon , thus reducing the precision of surgical operations ( fig . 2 ) . the influence of excessive protection on the surgeon mainly includes ( 1 ) difficulty breathing , ( 2 ) fog on goggles and face shields that interfere with vision , ( 3 ) constriction of visual fields , ( 4 ) loss of flexibility due to multiple layers of gloves , and ( 5 ) double or triple the duration of the operation . a practical lesson had been learned from the case of a 7-year-old girl with suspected covid-19 infection who was subjected to an urgent craniotomy due to obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a third ventricle germ cell-derived tumor . the surgical team adopted a level 3 precaution including n95 respirators or papr , and full coverage with protective gowns ( shoe covers included ) and sterile surgical gowns . consequently , an operation that would have taken 2-3 h ended up taking 10 h. possible solutions for reducing the impact of ppe on surgery include reducing the or temperature ( minimizing the formation of moisture on goggles ) and enhancing the lighting in the room to obtain better vision . all ppes are fit for single use except papr . the steps of donning and doffing should be completed under professional supervision ( fig . 3 ) . \n\n anesthesia \n\n regional nerve block is the first choice for limb surgeries . general anesthesia is recommended for neurosurgery , torso trauma , or multiple trauma with shock . \n\n attention should be paid to avoid aerosol generation caused by coughing and other causes in airway operations . intubation should be performed after rapid induction and full muscle relaxation to ensure complete disappearance of spontaneous breathing , and sputum aspiration before intubation should be avoided . remote endotracheal intubation by disposable glide scope with an assistant is recommended . awake endotracheal intubation is not recommended for patients with a difficult airway , hypoxia , or unconsciousness . if face mask or laryngeal mask ventilation is able to maintain oxygenation , multiple tools ( fiberoptic bronchoscope , glide scope , light stick , laryngeal mask ) can be used to assist endotracheal intubation after rapid induction of general anesthesia . if not , cricothyroid laryngotomy should be performed without any hesitation . rapid induction via oral intubation is recommended in cases of a possibly full stomach . mask positive pressure ventilation after administration should be avoided . no emetic measure is recommended . extra caution should be taken on when a nasogastric tube is in place . covid-19 can cause pulmonary inflammation that can induce added lung injury , restricted crystal fluid , and protective ventilation . the proper mechanical ventilation parameters include limited tidal volume ( < 8 ml/kg ) and airway pressure ( platform pressure < 30 cm h2o ) ; 5-10 cm h2o positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation ( peep ) is optional for alveoli expansion and oxygenation maintenance . permissive hypercapnia is also acceptable . \n\n surgical strategy \n\n the concept of damage control surgery should be followed to simplify the operation . it is optimal to finish an operation within 90 min , and strategies such as packing hemostasis , external fixation , and temporary abdominal closure are helpful to shorten the operation time . surgical personnel should be highly focused and closely coordinated . gentle movement is essential to avoid accidental injury and contamination caused by the spattering of blood , fluid , and bone debris . limiting rinsing and drainage of bodily fluids is another key to effectively reducing intraoperative contamination . reliable hemostasis should be maintained to prevent bleeding around the incision . excessive negative pressure suction and violent operations are prohibited . it is also suggested that electrotome use is not suitable under this scenario ; if it must be used , the power should be minimized . smoke should be quickly suctioned to avoid aerosol generation . \n\n postoperative management \n\n postoperative management of patients \n\n after the operation , the patient should be transferred to an isolation ward in the icu . the endotracheal tubes should be removed under analgesia to avoid violent coughing while the patient is stable . sputum aspiration should be performed by a closed suction system . trauma and surgery can impair the patient 's immune function . clinically , some asymptomatic covid-19 patients suffered rapid deterioration after surgery . surgeons and anesthesiologists should be aware that acute lung injury caused by covid-19 may exist preoperatively or worsen postoperatively . therefore , special attention should be paid to the monitoring of body temperature , infection , and hemodynamic index . reexamination of chest ct and rrt-pcr tests is also important . for postoperative trauma patients with fever , traumatic , or operative complications should also be considered to differentiate them from covid-19 . attention should be paid to symptomatic and etiological treatment . postoperative dyspnea and hypoxia should also be differentiated from complications such as pulmonary embolism . nutritional support and prevention of other complications ( bacterial infection , stress ulcer , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , and deep venous thrombosis ) should also be strengthened . \n\n quarantine \n\n based on current experience , if the medical personnel complete the operation successfully and comply with all the regulations without any accidental exposure , the patient does not need to be quarantined . otherwise , a 14-day medical observation is obligatory , and timely treatment is needed when any abnormalities occur . notably , some literature recommends a routine 14-day quarantine for relevant personnel involved in the operation for sars-cov-2 confirmed patients . however , extreme safety often results in severe incapacity to help patients , so a balance between safety and efficiency must be maintained . \n\n discussion \n\n the national health commission of china initially decided to temporarily call the disease novel coronavirus pneumonia or ncp . it was not until february 12 , 2020 , that the official name covid-19 was announced by the who . shortly after the who announced the disease 's official name , the virus causing it was named sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , highlighting the new virus 's similarity to the sars virus identified in 2003 . based on epidemiological data up to jan. 4 , 2020 , the estimated r0 was 2.2 ( 95 % ci , 1.4 to 3.9 ) , while the latest study surveying cases up to feb. 14 , 2020 , further calculated that the r0 of covid-19 was 3.77 . therefore , researchers estimated that in terms of infection ability , sars-cov-2 was slightly higher than the sars virus and significantly higher than the mers-cov . according to clinical characteristic analysis of sars-cov-2 infection in china , the mortality was 2.01 % out of 28,018 cases as of feb. 6 , 2020 . by human-to-human transmission , sars-cov-2 had spread rapidly from wuhan , china , to 24 other countries as of feb. 12 , 2020 . the number of cases within china and other countries is rapidly increasing , and it is estimated that for every additional 10 % decrease in transmission rate , the peak population will be reduced by 20-47 % . the cumulative number of infected cases and deaths will be reduced by 23-49 % due to comprehensive interventions . if current interventions continue , it is expected that the number of people infected will peak in early march 2020 . based on the epidemiological analysis , only 1.18 % of the patients had direct contact with wild animals , 31.30 % of the patients had been in wuhan , and 71.80 % of the patients had contact with people from wuhan . common symptoms included fever , cough , and diarrhea . a total of 76.4 % of patients had radiologic findings manifested as pneumonia , with the remaining patients exhibiting normal radiologic findings . poor clinical outcomes can be predicted by disease severity , including oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count , and chest ct manifestations . \n\n the transmission by aerosols is still under investigation . aerosols are solid , liquid , solid , and liquid granular substances suspended in the air , such as dust , smoke , fog , and microorganisms . these may be the `` flying vehicles '' for covid-19 . covid-19 aerosols are related to the increased risk of covid-19 transmission . tracheal intubation , noninvasive ventilation , tracheotomy , manual ventilation before intubation , bronchoscopy , cardiopulmonary resuscitation , sputum suction , and other airway operations , as well as the use of electrotome , suction , and drainage , all inevitably produce a large number of aerosols . when carrying out these operations , the protection and training of medical personnel should be strengthened , and preventive measures to protect against aerosols are recommended , including n95 respirators , papr , goggles or face shields , disposable fluid-resistant gowns , and limiting the number of people in the room . \n\n based on experience from the hospital in wuhan , patients with covid-19 have high mortality after surgery . as of february 14 , 2020 , 6 gastrointestinal operations were performed in the general surgery department of the authors ' hospital ; one 60-year-old male died of respiratory failure 14 days after surgery , and one died of septic shock , for a mortality rate of 33.33 % . another group of eight covid-19 confirmed patients in zhongnan hospital of wuhan university underwent gastrointestinal surgeries ( seven gastrointestinal tumors and one benign case ) ; one patient died of covid-19 after left hemicolectomy with the diagnosis of postoperative recurrence of renal cancer involving the descending colon with intestinal obstruction , and one tumor patient died from postoperative complications of abdominal infection , for a mortality rate of 25 % . trauma patients usually have massive hemorrhage , shock , and contamination . damage control strategies should be complied with to correct fatal triads caused by hypothermia , acidosis , and coagulopathy . meanwhile , effective oxygen therapy and organ function support are also indispensable . \n\n moreover , additional attention should be paid to patients in critical condition and to those who develop severe pneumonia after trauma . among covid-19 patients , critical patients , including patients with respiratory failure , septic shock , and other organ failures , have accounted for 29 % ~32 % . identifying high-risk groups with severe illness can also help reduce the occurrence of poor prognosis . the possible high-risk groups include patients over 65 years old , patients with obesity , and patients with other diseases ( such as chronic pulmonary disease , hypertension , heart disease , kidney disease , diabetes , tumor , and immune deficiency ) . \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe doffing \n\n the covid-19 outbreak poses significant challenges to hospital staff and specifically trauma surgeons , which must offer optimal and timely care despite the circumstances . strict safety protocols must be adhered to when carrying out emergency care for patients with severe trauma and other surgical diseases , which means that all the measures shall be carried out to preserve the ability of the medical staff to achieve the purpose of effective care without sacrificing the safety of all involved . the perspectives in this paper can not be a substitute for clinical judgment and expert consultation but can help provide up-to-date guidance on the clinical management of emergency surgery for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 ( fig . 4 ) . \n\n conclusion \n\n in conclusion , the covid-19 outbreak raises several issues concerning the safety of medical personnel and patients . areas with high incidence rates of covid-19 should conduct operations with caution and protection should be strengthened while ensuring suitable facilities to carry out optimal care with maximal safety . with the accumulation of clinical experience and in-depth research , some of the practices may require modification when additional high-quality evidence emerges . the above is china 's experience in treating trauma patients during the covid-19 outbreak . we hope that this report will help hospitals worldwide prepare for future covid-19 outbreaks and infection control in unexpected conditions . \n\n abbreviations \n\n covid-19 \n\n corona virus disease \n\n sars-cov-2 \n\n severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \n\n

00001000	applications of 3d printing technology to address covid-19 related supply shortages \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) was first identified in an outbreak in wuhan , china on december 8 , 2019 . globally , the number of affected covid-19 patients is growing exponentially , with the death toll exceeding 27,300 as of march 27 , 2020 . worldwide , there is a limited supply of n95 respirator masks , face shields , ventilator valves , testing kits and other personal protective equipment . thus , adequate production and distribution of personal protective equipment is critical during this pandemic . to address these shortages , three-dimensional ( 3d ) printing , a novel and innovative technology used to fabricate complex architectures , is well suited . 3d printing is an adjustable , robotic platform allowing for tailored deposition of biomaterials using computer-aided design systems to formulate layer-by-layer custom designs with controlled architecture and composition . \n\n masks \n\n n95 respirators masks have two advantages over surgical , paper or cloth masks : 1 ) they are > 95 % efficient at filtering 0.3-microm airborne particles and 2 ) they are fit tested to each user to ensure an adequate seal , such that air and small droplets do not enter around the edges of the mask and into the health care worker 's breathing zone . the centers for disease control and prevention recommends n95 masks for health care workers taking care of patients with covid-19 . \n\n 3d printing can be used to produce tailored seal designs for improving mask comfort and fit . to customize face mask seals , 3d laser scanning can be implemented to scan exact facial parameters , with a tailored and customized face seal n95 template . anthropometric data of the chin arc , jawline , face and nose lengths , and nose protrusion measurements can be taken into account with this customized seal . in a study using face seal prototypes with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic using a fused deposition modeling 3d printer , three subjects showed improved contact pressure compared with use of 3m 8210 n95 ffr respirator masks . moreover , a personalized mask may account for facial hair length and density for a more precise fit . \n\n displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . the biomaterials displayed in this image have been fully characterized in the medical literature , with the same material composition of n95 masks . the mask includes several layers thereby ensure effective filtration of viral particles . \n\n figure 1 \n\n standard n95 masks consist of filtration material composed of electrostatic non-woven polypropylene ( pp ) fibers which are semi-rigid , lightweight and fatigue resistant . the semi-crystalline structure may cause significant distortion of the 3d printed parts upon cooling thereby making 3d printing difficult . material extrusion 3d printing was used to design a 3d printable thermoplastic elastomeric material from a blend of polypropylene ( pp ) and styrene- ( ethylene-butylene ) -styrene ( sebs ) . this blend provides better printability and flexibility for n95 mask design . pp is commonly used for various industrial applications due to its low cost , processability , printability , recyclability and mechanical integrity . sebs is a polymeric elastomer with low processing temperature and low distortion during extrusion . thus , the pp/sebs combination would improve the processability of 3d printed n95 masks . moreover , controlling the thermoplastic elastomer ratio allows for tailoring the flexibility and elasticity of the 3d model material for better fitted masks . 3d melt electrospinning printing can also be used to create pp microfibers with sequential layering to accurately obtain a 3d form . thus , 3d printing procedures may allow for the creation of stable and biocompatible n95 masks that are comparable to industrial manufacturing brands . figure 1 displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . \n\n face shields \n\n polycarbonate and polyester , polyvinyl chloride and other synthetic polymers are commonly used to make surgical face shields . these biomaterials are transparent , lightweight and provide high optical clarity . the polymers can easily be printed using 3d technology to meet the needs of healthcare workers treating covid-19 . \n\n covid-19 specimen collection kit \n\n creating 3d printed test swabs would help increase covid-19 testing capacity . nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs can be made from a flexible polymer , using polystyrene for the shaft . the tip can be tailored to be micro fine using computer-aided design software . thereafter , swab bud lattice fibers can be made from calcium alginate using hydrogels using 3d tissue engineering . \n\n ventilator valves \n\n ventilator valves are attachments used to deliver oxygen at fixed concentrations for patients with acute respiratory distress , including covid-19 patients . 3d printing technology can be used via a filament extrusion system or a polymer-laser powder bed fusion process to print single-use valve sets . 3d printers can design the different elements of the valve using biomaterials such as polyamide and polysulfone , polycarbonate , silicone rubber and stainless steel . furthermore , these disposable valves eliminate time-consuming sterilization . \n\n medications \n\n 3d printing techniques , such as fused filament , inkjet , extrusion and powder extrusion , allow for fabrication of 3d printed pills . medication-printing technologies typically utilize a small nozzle to lay thin disc-shaped layers of powders and deposit microscopic droplets of liquid to bind the materials . a coaxial needle extrusion 3d technology was used to print active pharmaceutical ingredients and create combinations of controlled dosing of drugs . while there are no specific antivirals or vaccines for treatment of covid-19 , several well-characterized anti-viral drugs are being considered as therapies . it may be possible to use 3d medication-printing technology to effectively and rapidly print lopinavir/ritonavir , chloroquine , and hydroxychloroquine pills . thus , 3d technology has the potential to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry , making drug research , development and production applicable to covid-19 patients . \n\n as the covid-19 outbreak rapidly evolves , there has been a personal protective equipment shortage globally . 3d printing inventions can be rapidly applied to address these deficiencies . cost , processing time , testing , and manpower are potential barriers to creating 3d-printed personal protective equipment . however , the synthetic polymer biomaterials needed for 3d-printed personal protective equipment are exact or very similar in composition to the standard manufacturing grade products ( i.e . n95 masks provides the same fluid barrier and air filtration protection ) . moreover , these synthetic polymer materials are readily available and cost effective ( i.e . polypropylene is 12.47 cents per pound ) . 3d printer costs vary but are an excellent investment with labor performed via robotics . in conjunction with flattening the curve via social distancing , this pioneering technology can provide adequate personal protective equipment for health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic . \n\n abbreviations : \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) \n\n three-dimensional ( 3d ) \n\n polypropylene ( pp ) \n\n

00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region , presented to the emergency with a 3-day history of headaches , dizziness , intermittent nausea , and vomiting . brain mr showed a tumor that was entirely confined within the third ventricle ,

00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region , presented to the emergency with a 3-day history of headaches , dizziness , intermittent nausea , and vomiting . brain mr showed a tumor that was entirely confined within the third ventricle , causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was

00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region , presented to the emergency with a 3-day history of headaches , dizziness , intermittent nausea , and vomiting . brain mr showed a tumor that was entirely confined within the third ventricle , causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was

causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the

00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu
