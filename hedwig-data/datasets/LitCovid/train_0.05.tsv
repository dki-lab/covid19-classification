00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region , presented to the emergency with a 3-day history of headaches , dizziness , intermittent nausea , and vomiting . brain mr showed a tumor that was entirely confined within the third ventricle , causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the child has an uncomplicated recovery after surgery , and covid-19 was eventually ruled out after a 14-day quarantine . \n\n finally , we have some additional tips for conducting surgery under level 3 precautions . a comfortable goggle and use of antifogging agent are very helpful . in addition , surgeons should avoid unnecessary conversation and perform the surgery as gently as possible to prevent splashing blood in a negative pressure operating room . \n\n neuro-oncology patients may become infected with covid-19 , and thus surgery for these patients can not be avoided . as neurosurgeons , it is crucial that we do our utmost to care for our patients while ensuring our own safety at the same time . in these challenging times , we have faith that through our concerted efforts , this pandemic will be overcome soon . \n\n publisher 's note \n\n springer nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations . \n\n compliance with ethical

00001000	'let us help'- why senior medical students are the next step in battling the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n as senior medical students in the uk , we read dr stein 's letter on the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) 2 and began wondering where we fit in , in this pandemic . as the government heads into a 'war footing ' 13 , there is an increased need for medical staff . there is speculation of bringing back retired doctors , many of who fall into at risk categories . with clinical placement and exams cancelled , we are determined to use our hard-earned skills in some way , to help in what is the biggest global emergency of our lifetime . 
00001000	role of mask/respirator protection against sars-cov-2 \n\n to the editor \n\n since its outbreak on december 31 , 2019 , in wuhan , a central city in china , coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) has now spread to almost all countries in the world . it has been declared a pandemic , and it has infected over 1,041,126 people in a very short time , with 55,132 deaths as ofapril 3 , 2020 . wearing masks/respirators and practicingself-isolation at home have been recommended as guidelines for thepublic . however , the problem is the number of cases among medical personnel . interestingly , a higher risk of infection was noticed in male professionals . there are currently many types of masks/respirators available , ranging from simple surgical masks designed to protect wearers from microorganism transmission and fit loosely to the user 's face , through n95 masks used to prevent users from inhaling small airborne particles . these must fit tightly to the user 's face . masks differ primarily in their maximum internal leakage rate limit . surgical masks are designed to protect against droplets or particles with a diameter of > 100 mum , whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) virus is essentially spherical , albeit slightly pleomorphic , with a diameter of 60-140 nm and 100 times smaller than the pore diameter . thus , surgical masks can not prevent inhalation of small airborne particles ; however , both can protect users from large droplets and sprays . the pn-en 149:2001 standard defines 3 protection classes for half masks : filtering face piece 1 ( ffp1 ) , filtering face piece 2 ( ffp2 ) , and filtering face piece 3 ( ffp3 ) . the maximum internal leakage limit is 25 % for ffp1 , 11 % for ffp2 , and 5 % for ffp3 . class ffp1 masks retain about 80 % of particles smaller than 2 mum , ffp2 ones retain 94 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum , and ffp3 ones retain 99.95 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum ( table ) . \n\n test ffp1 ffp2 ffp3 concentration of harmful substances till 4 x nds till 10 x nds till 30 x nds leakage < 22 % < 8 % < 2 % penetration < 20 % < 6 % < 1 % initial expiration resistance at 95 l/min < 210 pa < 240 pa < 300 pa \n\n filtration efficiency for each class of masks \n\n abbreviations : ffp1 , filtering face piece 1 ; ffp2 , filtering face piece 2 ; ffp3 , filtering face piece 3 ; nds , the highest acceptable concentration of the harmful factor . \n\n at the moment , we may meet divergent recommendations for the use of masks . while the centers for disease control and prevention recommend the use of masks in low-risk and high-risk situations , the world health organization advises applying masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations . long et al conclude in their meta-analysis that the use of n95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza . they suggest that n95 respirators should not be recommended for the general public and non-high-risk medical staff who are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients . \n\n the potential of face masks to reduce the spread of respiratory infections could be useful . wang et al indicated that 10 of 213 medical professionals with no mask were infected by covid-19 as compared with 0 of 278 wearing n95 respirators . \n\n it is also worth noting that the respirator increases resistance to inhalation . the longer they are used , the more difficult breathing becomes because of more absorbed dust . what is more , the effectiveness decreases with the increase of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the respirator and face ( the so-called dead space ) . the concentration of carbon dioxide in the dead space increases with each subsequent exhalation . therefore , masks should be replaced frequently . additionally , to improve the comfort of use , masks use 1-way exhalation valves , which accelerate the circulation of gases.6 \n\n to conclude , the use of protective masks can and should be the first protection against sars-cov-2 transmission to medical personnel . medical personnel should use class ffp3 masks . additionally , the application of visors to cover the entire face during contact with the patient is worth considering . \n\n references \n\n association between 2019-ncov transmission and n95 respirator use . \n\n comparison of performance of three different types of respiratory protection devices . \n\n protecting healthcare staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome : filtration capacity of multiple surgical masks . \n\n a close shave ? performance of p2/n95 respirators in health care workers with facial hair : results of the beards ( adequate respiratory defences ) study . \n\n effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza : a systematic review and meta-analysis . \n\n cloth masks versus medical masks for covid-19 . 
00001000	emergency trauma care during the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in china \n\n background \n\n a novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in wuhan , hubei province , in december 2019 ; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans . china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease . however , a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking . to regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak , we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in wuhan . \n\n main body \n\n the article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 , indications for emergency surgery , and infection prevention and control for medical personnel , providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period . \n\n conclusions \n\n the measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of covid-19 . \n\n background \n\n a novel corona virus disease ( covid-19 ) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) began in wuhan , hubei province , china , in december 2019 . by february 13 , 2020 , more than 60,000 cases were confirmed , nearly 50,000 in hubei alone , and the source of the infection was yet to be definitely determined . the world health organization ( who ) has declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) . considering the current rate of human to human transmission , most countries in the world should be well prepared for the potential global covid-19 pandemic . china is on the frontline in the fight against the virus , and medical staff have become exhausted due to the excessive workload brought on by the outbreak . medical testing tools and personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , such as face shields , goggles , and gloves , have become scarce and have had to be rationed among teams and medical centers , with severe shortage in hubei , the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak . a report from a neurosurgery department of a teaching hospital in wuhan showed that from december 25 , 2019 , to february 6 , 2020 , eight covid-19 suspected patients were admitted , and three were confirmed . consequently , 12 medical personnel were infected ( 11 nurses and one doctor ) , among whom three had been in close contact with the first confirmed case . according to the data released by the national health commission ( nhc ) of the people 's republic of china , a total of 1716 medical personnel infections had been reported nationwide , accounting for 3.8 % of the total confirmed cases by 24:00 on february 11 , 2020 , of which six ( 0.4 % ) had died . of these , hubei province reported 1502 cases , accounting for 87.5 % of the total medical personnel infections , while wuhan city reported 1102 cases , accounting for 73.4 % . notably , medical personnel are the most valuable resource during the outbreak . how to protect them from infection is one of the foremost challenges in the fight against sars-cov-2 . \n\n although china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of sars-cov-2 , severe trauma can still occur . during the outbreak , the population of trauma patients may be diverse in terms of infection status , including patients who were previously healthy , suspected to be infected , confirmed infected , close contacts of infected individuals , and asymptomatic carriers . thus , balancing optimal trauma care while preventing further spread of the viral infection during the outbreak is a major challenge . \n\n to our knowledge , there is no relevant consensus or clinical guideline available on the indications of , timing of or perioperative protection during emergency surgery for trauma . to protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of trauma care , we have summarized the recommended perioperative infection prevention and control measures for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 based on current practical experience in china and the published literature on surgical practice during the past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) , ebola virus , and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n main text \n\n general principles \n\n special requirements for the hospitals receiving trauma patients during the outbreak \n\n emergency department : set up a triage area for assessment of all patients at admission , allowing early recognition of possible sars-cov-2 infection and immediate isolation of patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection in an area separate from other patients . \n\n radiology department : a dedicated ct room should be kept on standby for the examination of infected patients . \n\n operating room ( or ) : a relatively isolated negative-pressure or is preferable ; if there is no permanent negative-pressure or , a temporarily modified negative-pressure or the main operating suite of the hospital can be converted . \n\n intensive care unit ( icu ) : an isolated area should be prepared in the icu , and suspected patients should be treated in a single space . \n\n intrahospital transport : although an ideal trauma center with a door-to-door ct room and negative-pressure or are preferable in this situation , most regions in china do not operate such facilities . therefore , a predetermined transport route should be used to minimize exposure , and any intrahospital transport should utilize dedicated carts demarcated by a warning logo equipped with protective supplies and hand disinfectants . the patient should wear a medical mask , and the walls and the floor of the passageways and the elevator should be covered with a plastic lining . \n\n to control the spread of covid-19 , basic principles for treating infectious diseases should be followed , and necessary measures should be taken before receiving trauma patients . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n precaution level applicable personnel and scenarios personal protective equipment level 1 triage , emergency department clean non-sterile long gown , disposable head cover , disposable medical mask , and gloves . level 2 close contact with suspected patients , or handling secretions , feces , and personal items belonging to patients ; performing ct scan ( fig . 1 ) disposable head cover , gloves , disposable coverall , n95 respirator or equivalent , goggle or face shield , rubber boots or fluid-resistant overshoes , etc . level 3 close contact with suspected patients , or collecting blood , respiratory tract samples of patients , especially for endotracheal intubation , airway care , and sputum suction , as well as emergency surgery ( fig . 2 ) . on the basis of wearing secondary protective equipment such as goggle or face shield , other protective equipment should be strengthened . for instance , adding disposable surgical clothing and gloves in addition to disposable coverall and gloves . two layers of gloves covering protective clothing and surgical clothes sleeves , respectively , use of a powered air purifying respirator ( papr ) . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n to standardize and simplify the precaution measures and equipment required for different personnel and scenarios in trauma care , we adopted a three-level precaution protocol in trauma care ( table 1 ) . \n\n all levels of precaution were based on implementing standard precautions , including hand hygiene , respiratory hygiene , and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment ( ppe ) according to different risk levels . proper training of the standard donning and doffing procedures is the basis of effective protection . in epidemic areas such as hubei province , all patients can be regarded as potentially suspected patients during the outbreak , and the level of the precaution should be elevated . \n\n triage \n\n classification of the patients suspected cases clinical confirmed cases ( hubei only ) pathogenic confirmed cases diagnostic basis outside hubei province : two of the clinical manifestations with at least one of the epidemiological histories , three of the clinical manifestations without epidemiological history suspected patient in hubei province with ct findings of pneumonia suspected or clinically confirmed patients with at least one pathogenic evidence epidemiological investigation 1 . travel to or residence in wuhan in the 14 days prior to symptom onset ; 2 . close contactb with sars-cov-2 infection ( rrt-pcr positive ) within 14 days before onset ; 3 . exposed to patients from wuhan and surrounding areas , or from a community with patients who reported fever or respiratory symptoms14 d before onset ; 4 . clustering outbreak . - - clinical manifestations and ct scan 1 . fever and/or respiratory symptoms ; 2 . imaging characteristics of covid-19 ( ct : multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes in early stage , which are obvious in the peripheral lung , and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs , and lung consolidation may occur in severe cases ) ; 3 . the total number of white blood cells in the early stage is normal or decreased , and the lymphocyte count is decreased - - pathogenic evidence null null 1 . detection of sars-cov-2 in respiratory specimens and sera by rrt-pcr assays ; 2 . by virus dna sequencing , respiratory or blood samples dna sequence highly homologous with sars-cov-2 . \n\n diagnostic criteria of covid-19a \n\n covid-19 coronavirus induced disease , sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 , rrt-pcr real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \n\n athe diagnostic criteria were defined according to guidance for the diagnosis and management for covid-19 ( 5th edition ) released by national health commission of people 's republic of china in feb. 4 , 2020 \n\n bclose contact is defined as follows : \n\n - healthcare-associated exposure , including providing direct care for covid-19 patients , working with healthcare workers infected with novel coronavirus , visiting patients , or staying in the same close environment as a covid-19 patient \n\n - working together in close proximity or sharing the same classroom environment with a covid-19 patient \n\n - traveling together with a covid-19 patient in any kind of conveyance \n\n - living in the same household as a covid-19 patient \n\n trauma patients during the outbreak should be managed using the relevant contents in table 2 , and they should complete a brief epidemiological investigation at the triage stage . however , the trauma patients ' history may be unreliable , as they may not have time to be detailed . more emphasis should be placed on the objective data . during the outbreak in wuhan , a total of 32 emergency operations were performed in a tertiary care hospital , including 19 suspected and seven pathogenic confirmed cases . in addition , nine covid-19 patients in another tertiary care hospital underwent gastrointestinal surgery , but in all of these patients , covid-19 was diagnosed postoperatively . it is worth noting that there have been many cases of asymptomatic patients with an incubation period . the maximum incubation period was reported to be 24 days . \n\n evaluation \n\n trauma care is highly time dependent and requires rapid and effective evaluation and management . during the outbreak , primary and secondary surveys should be completed while maintaining the premise of effective protection . \n\n general principles of evaluation \n\n dynamic evaluation strategies should be conducted throughout the trauma care process . the personal protective equipment ( ppe ) worn by medical personnel may result in limited or incomplete physical examinations ( such as palpation and auscultation ) . therefore , injury assessment may rely on radiological examinations . \n\n radiology evaluation \n\n a chest ct scan is recommended for all severe trauma patients if there is no contraindication . if the chest ct scan is not possible due to critical condition , the patient should be treated as a suspect for infection until infection is excluded . \n\n level 3 ppe during ct examination \n\n if the hospital has a trauma resuscitation unit , complete x-ray including but not limited to the chest and focused assessment with sonography for trauma ( fast ) in the trauma resuscitation unit should be performed . for hemodynamic stabilization , a ct scan including but not limited to the chest should be performed ( fig . 1 ) . if the hospital does not have a trauma resuscitation unit , patients with hemodynamic instability should be resuscitated in the emergency department and undergo fast simultaneously . once the hemodynamic status is stable enough , the ct scan should be performed as soon as possible . \n\n ct scan protocol for trauma patients suspected of having covid-19 : medical personnel should first determine the method and scope of the scan , including but not limited to the chest , according to the mechanism of injury . for stab wounds , the segment and body cavity near the wound should be examined . for gunshot wounds , due to the high kinetic energy of the projectiles , the tortuous wound path , and the heavy tissue damage , the scanning range should be expanded appropriately . patients who have sustained blunt injuries with high energy , such as traffic injuries , should usually be scanned with enhanced scanning ranging from head to mid-thigh ( including the whole lower limb when there is lower limb injury ) . enhanced scanning is helpful in providing further information on organ injury , and three-dimensional reconstruction of blood vessels and bone should be performed when major vascular and bone injury is suspected . \n\n ct features of covid-19 : it should be noted that the pulmonary imaging changes of covid-19 vary depending on the patient 's age , immunity status , stage of disease at the time of the scan , underlying disease , and drug intervention . reports have shown that in the early stage of infection , ct shows multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes , which are obvious in the peripheral lung and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs . in severe cases , lung consolidation could occur . in addition , special attention should be paid to discerning between covid-19 infection and pulmonary contusion . \n\n blood and pathogen specimen collection \n\n if possible , nasopharyngeal swabs , sputum , lower respiratory tract secretions , and blood samples should be collected and sent for rrt-pcr in the emergency period . if no respiratory tract specimens are collected before the operation due to time constraints , they can be collected during or after the operation . \n\n all specimens shall be deemed to be potentially infectious . collection , transportation , and processing of any clinical specimens should be performed by biological safety training qualified medical staff . level 3 precautions should be adopted to minimize the possibility of exposure . \n\n the results of rrt-pcr may be falsely negative due to the influence of sampling , transportation , extraction , and testing . recent observations have shown that 30 to 40 % of patients with covid-19 ct features were rrt-pcr negative . as a result , the protection standard can not be lowered due to negative results . since the rrt-pcr test can take several hours to confirm the diagnosis , chest ct is recommended as the basis for the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 in suspected patients , especially in areas with a high incidence of the disease . the use of chest ct not only helps to control the spread of the epidemic but can also ensure definitive care for trauma injuries in a timely manner . \n\n emergency surgery \n\n emergency surgery is of great importance for severe trauma patients , the aim of which includes hemorrhage control , contamination abatement , and compartment pressure relief as soon as possible . effective prevention of sars-cov-2 transmission by standard intraoperative protective measures is an important indicator of a successful operation . from the available evidence , sars-cov-2 is spread mainly through respiratory droplets and contact , while aerosol and fecal-oral transmission are still under investigation . from the existing evidence and our practical experience , all medical staff should adopt level 3 precautions when entering the or . \n\n or preparation \n\n an independent negative pressure operation room is the first choice . operations can only be performed when the pressure is between - 10 and - 5 pa . if a negative pressure or is not available , a relatively isolated or with an independent purification system is an alternative option . nevertheless , the purification system should be shut down during the operation , and a final disinfection should be performed postoperatively . as in standard trauma protocols , the more critical patient should be operated on first . if two or more suspected or confirmed infected patients arrive in the or , a 30-min disinfection is warranted before the subsequent operation . the dedicated or should be clearly marked as covid-19 exclusive . \n\n the dedicated covid-19 or should be designed with a special passage and elevator . the design should focus on shortening the outdoor distance , reducing the chance of human contact , and limiting the time spent in suspected contaminated areas . materials and equipment should only be delivered by specially assigned staff . people inside the or are not allowed to leave during the operation , and outdoor personnel should not enter without permission . surgical articles should be clearly identified , and the use of disposable items is recommended . to maintain pressure , surgical supplies ( surgical instruments , dressings , single-use consumables , high-value consumables , medications , and relevant items ) should be well prepared in advance . only unidirectional flow is permitted ( nothing should be taken out once it is entered during the operation ) . personnel movement and the frequency of door opening are strictly limited . nondisposable items should be disposed of postoperatively in strict accordance with regulations . two suction apparatuses are optimal , one of which is for exclusive use by the anesthesiologist . the negative pressure aspirator should be immediately placed on the patient 's face to minimize the spread of respiratory secretions after entering the operation room . \n\n ppe for operation personnel \n\n protective clothing for surgical personnel : a after wearing protective clothing and inner gloves , b after wearing operating clothes and outer gloves \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe donning \n\n the topic of intraoperative protection remains controversial because most surgeons have no experience performing surgery while wearing heavy and airproof contagion gowns and goggles . according to practice in china , some medical personnel wore two surgical gowns , two contagion gowns and four pairs of gloves for surgery during the covid-19 epidemic . instead of enhancing protective effects , such excessive protection can reduce the visual , auditory , and tactile sensitivity of the surgeon , thus reducing the precision of surgical operations ( fig . 2 ) . the influence of excessive protection on the surgeon mainly includes ( 1 ) difficulty breathing , ( 2 ) fog on goggles and face shields that interfere with vision , ( 3 ) constriction of visual fields , ( 4 ) loss of flexibility due to multiple layers of gloves , and ( 5 ) double or triple the duration of the operation . a practical lesson had been learned from the case of a 7-year-old girl with suspected covid-19 infection who was subjected to an urgent craniotomy due to obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a third ventricle germ cell-derived tumor . the surgical team adopted a level 3 precaution including n95 respirators or papr , and full coverage with protective gowns ( shoe covers included ) and sterile surgical gowns . consequently , an operation that would have taken 2-3 h ended up taking 10 h. possible solutions for reducing the impact of ppe on surgery include reducing the or temperature ( minimizing the formation of moisture on goggles ) and enhancing the lighting in the room to obtain better vision . all ppes are fit for single use except papr . the steps of donning and doffing should be completed under professional supervision ( fig . 3 ) . \n\n anesthesia \n\n regional nerve block is the first choice for limb surgeries . general anesthesia is recommended for neurosurgery , torso trauma , or multiple trauma with shock . \n\n attention should be paid to avoid aerosol generation caused by coughing and other causes in airway operations . intubation should be performed after rapid induction and full muscle relaxation to ensure complete disappearance of spontaneous breathing , and sputum aspiration before intubation should be avoided . remote endotracheal intubation by disposable glide scope with an assistant is recommended . awake endotracheal intubation is not recommended for patients with a difficult airway , hypoxia , or unconsciousness . if face mask or laryngeal mask ventilation is able to maintain oxygenation , multiple tools ( fiberoptic bronchoscope , glide scope , light stick , laryngeal mask ) can be used to assist endotracheal intubation after rapid induction of general anesthesia . if not , cricothyroid laryngotomy should be performed without any hesitation . rapid induction via oral intubation is recommended in cases of a possibly full stomach . mask positive pressure ventilation after administration should be avoided . no emetic measure is recommended . extra caution should be taken on when a nasogastric tube is in place . covid-19 can cause pulmonary inflammation that can induce added lung injury , restricted crystal fluid , and protective ventilation . the proper mechanical ventilation parameters include limited tidal volume ( < 8 ml/kg ) and airway pressure ( platform pressure < 30 cm h2o ) ; 5-10 cm h2o positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation ( peep ) is optional for alveoli expansion and oxygenation maintenance . permissive hypercapnia is also acceptable . \n\n surgical strategy \n\n the concept of damage control surgery should be followed to simplify the operation . it is optimal to finish an operation within 90 min , and strategies such as packing hemostasis , external fixation , and temporary abdominal closure are helpful to shorten the operation time . surgical personnel should be highly focused and closely coordinated . gentle movement is essential to avoid accidental injury and contamination caused by the spattering of blood , fluid , and bone debris . limiting rinsing and drainage of bodily fluids is another key to effectively reducing intraoperative contamination . reliable hemostasis should be maintained to prevent bleeding around the incision . excessive negative pressure suction and violent operations are prohibited . it is also suggested that electrotome use is not suitable under this scenario ; if it must be used , the power should be minimized . smoke should be quickly suctioned to avoid aerosol generation . \n\n postoperative management \n\n postoperative management of patients \n\n after the operation , the patient should be transferred to an isolation ward in the icu . the endotracheal tubes should be removed under analgesia to avoid violent coughing while the patient is stable . sputum aspiration should be performed by a closed suction system . trauma and surgery can impair the patient 's immune function . clinically , some asymptomatic covid-19 patients suffered rapid deterioration after surgery . surgeons and anesthesiologists should be aware that acute lung injury caused by covid-19 may exist preoperatively or worsen postoperatively . therefore , special attention should be paid to the monitoring of body temperature , infection , and hemodynamic index . reexamination of chest ct and rrt-pcr tests is also important . for postoperative trauma patients with fever , traumatic , or operative complications should also be considered to differentiate them from covid-19 . attention should be paid to symptomatic and etiological treatment . postoperative dyspnea and hypoxia should also be differentiated from complications such as pulmonary embolism . nutritional support and prevention of other complications ( bacterial infection , stress ulcer , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , and deep venous thrombosis ) should also be strengthened . \n\n quarantine \n\n based on current experience , if the medical personnel complete the operation successfully and comply with all the regulations without any accidental exposure , the patient does not need to be quarantined . otherwise , a 14-day medical observation is obligatory , and timely treatment is needed when any abnormalities occur . notably , some literature recommends a routine 14-day quarantine for relevant personnel involved in the operation for sars-cov-2 confirmed patients . however , extreme safety often results in severe incapacity to help patients , so a balance between safety and efficiency must be maintained . \n\n discussion \n\n the national health commission of china initially decided to temporarily call the disease novel coronavirus pneumonia or ncp . it was not until february 12 , 2020 , that the official name covid-19 was announced by the who . shortly after the who announced the disease 's official name , the virus causing it was named sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , highlighting the new virus 's similarity to the sars virus identified in 2003 . based on epidemiological data up to jan. 4 , 2020 , the estimated r0 was 2.2 ( 95 % ci , 1.4 to 3.9 ) , while the latest study surveying cases up to feb. 14 , 2020 , further calculated that the r0 of covid-19 was 3.77 . therefore , researchers estimated that in terms of infection ability , sars-cov-2 was slightly higher than the sars virus and significantly higher than the mers-cov . according to clinical characteristic analysis of sars-cov-2 infection in china , the mortality was 2.01 % out of 28,018 cases as of feb. 6 , 2020 . by human-to-human transmission , sars-cov-2 had spread rapidly from wuhan , china , to 24 other countries as of feb. 12 , 2020 . the number of cases within china and other countries is rapidly increasing , and it is estimated that for every additional 10 % decrease in transmission rate , the peak population will be reduced by 20-47 % . the cumulative number of infected cases and deaths will be reduced by 23-49 % due to comprehensive interventions . if current interventions continue , it is expected that the number of people infected will peak in early march 2020 . based on the epidemiological analysis , only 1.18 % of the patients had direct contact with wild animals , 31.30 % of the patients had been in wuhan , and 71.80 % of the patients had contact with people from wuhan . common symptoms included fever , cough , and diarrhea . a total of 76.4 % of patients had radiologic findings manifested as pneumonia , with the remaining patients exhibiting normal radiologic findings . poor clinical outcomes can be predicted by disease severity , including oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count , and chest ct manifestations . \n\n the transmission by aerosols is still under investigation . aerosols are solid , liquid , solid , and liquid granular substances suspended in the air , such as dust , smoke , fog , and microorganisms . these may be the `` flying vehicles '' for covid-19 . covid-19 aerosols are related to the increased risk of covid-19 transmission . tracheal intubation , noninvasive ventilation , tracheotomy , manual ventilation before intubation , bronchoscopy , cardiopulmonary resuscitation , sputum suction , and other airway operations , as well as the use of electrotome , suction , and drainage , all inevitably produce a large number of aerosols . when carrying out these operations , the protection and training of medical personnel should be strengthened , and preventive measures to protect against aerosols are recommended , including n95 respirators , papr , goggles or face shields , disposable fluid-resistant gowns , and limiting the number of people in the room . \n\n based on experience from the hospital in wuhan , patients with covid-19 have high mortality after surgery . as of february 14 , 2020 , 6 gastrointestinal operations were performed in the general surgery department of the authors ' hospital ; one 60-year-old male died of respiratory failure 14 days after surgery , and one died of septic shock , for a mortality rate of 33.33 % . another group of eight covid-19 confirmed patients in zhongnan hospital of wuhan university underwent gastrointestinal surgeries ( seven gastrointestinal tumors and one benign case ) ; one patient died of covid-19 after left hemicolectomy with the diagnosis of postoperative recurrence of renal cancer involving the descending colon with intestinal obstruction , and one tumor patient died from postoperative complications of abdominal infection , for a mortality rate of 25 % . trauma patients usually have massive hemorrhage , shock , and contamination . damage control strategies should be complied with to correct fatal triads caused by hypothermia , acidosis , and coagulopathy . meanwhile , effective oxygen therapy and organ function support are also indispensable . \n\n moreover , additional attention should be paid to patients in critical condition and to those who develop severe pneumonia after trauma . among covid-19 patients , critical patients , including patients with respiratory failure , septic shock , and other organ failures , have accounted for 29 % ~32 % . identifying high-risk groups with severe illness can also help reduce the occurrence of poor prognosis . the possible high-risk groups include patients over 65 years old , patients with obesity , and patients with other diseases ( such as chronic pulmonary disease , hypertension , heart disease , kidney disease , diabetes , tumor , and immune deficiency ) . \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe doffing \n\n the covid-19 outbreak poses significant challenges to hospital staff and specifically trauma surgeons , which must offer optimal and timely care despite the circumstances . strict safety protocols must be adhered to when carrying out emergency care for patients with severe trauma and other surgical diseases , which means that all the measures shall be carried out to preserve the ability of the medical staff to achieve the purpose of effective care without sacrificing the safety of all involved . the perspectives in this paper can not be a substitute for clinical judgment and expert consultation but can help provide up-to-date guidance on the clinical management of emergency surgery for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 ( fig . 4 ) . \n\n conclusion \n\n in conclusion , the covid-19 outbreak raises several issues concerning the safety of medical personnel and patients . areas with high incidence rates of covid-19 should conduct operations with caution and protection should be strengthened while ensuring suitable facilities to carry out optimal care with maximal safety . with the accumulation of clinical experience and in-depth research , some of the practices may require modification when additional high-quality evidence emerges . the above is china 's experience in treating trauma patients during the covid-19 outbreak . we hope that this report will help hospitals worldwide prepare for future covid-19 outbreaks and infection control in unexpected conditions . \n\n abbreviations \n\n covid-19 \n\n corona virus disease \n\n sars-cov-2 \n\n severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \n\n

00001000	applications of 3d printing technology to address covid-19 related supply shortages \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) was first identified in an outbreak in wuhan , china on december 8 , 2019 . globally , the number of affected covid-19 patients is growing exponentially , with the death toll exceeding 27,300 as of march 27 , 2020 . worldwide , there is a limited supply of n95 respirator masks , face shields , ventilator valves , testing kits and other personal protective equipment . thus , adequate production and distribution of personal protective equipment is critical during this pandemic . to address these shortages , three-dimensional ( 3d ) printing , a novel and innovative technology used to fabricate complex architectures , is well suited . 3d printing is an adjustable , robotic platform allowing for tailored deposition of biomaterials using computer-aided design systems to formulate layer-by-layer custom designs with controlled architecture and composition . \n\n masks \n\n n95 respirators masks have two advantages over surgical , paper or cloth masks : 1 ) they are > 95 % efficient at filtering 0.3-microm airborne particles and 2 ) they are fit tested to each user to ensure an adequate seal , such that air and small droplets do not enter around the edges of the mask and into the health care worker 's breathing zone . the centers for disease control and prevention recommends n95 masks for health care workers taking care of patients with covid-19 . \n\n 3d printing can be used to produce tailored seal designs for improving mask comfort and fit . to customize face mask seals , 3d laser scanning can be implemented to scan exact facial parameters , with a tailored and customized face seal n95 template . anthropometric data of the chin arc , jawline , face and nose lengths , and nose protrusion measurements can be taken into account with this customized seal . in a study using face seal prototypes with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic using a fused deposition modeling 3d printer , three subjects showed improved contact pressure compared with use of 3m 8210 n95 ffr respirator masks . moreover , a personalized mask may account for facial hair length and density for a more precise fit . \n\n displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . the biomaterials displayed in this image have been fully characterized in the medical literature , with the same material composition of n95 masks . the mask includes several layers thereby ensure effective filtration of viral particles . \n\n figure 1 \n\n standard n95 masks consist of filtration material composed of electrostatic non-woven polypropylene ( pp ) fibers which are semi-rigid , lightweight and fatigue resistant . the semi-crystalline structure may cause significant distortion of the 3d printed parts upon cooling thereby making 3d printing difficult . material extrusion 3d printing was used to design a 3d printable thermoplastic elastomeric material from a blend of polypropylene ( pp ) and styrene- ( ethylene-butylene ) -styrene ( sebs ) . this blend provides better printability and flexibility for n95 mask design . pp is commonly used for various industrial applications due to its low cost , processability , printability , recyclability and mechanical integrity . sebs is a polymeric elastomer with low processing temperature and low distortion during extrusion . thus , the pp/sebs combination would improve the processability of 3d printed n95 masks . moreover , controlling the thermoplastic elastomer ratio allows for tailoring the flexibility and elasticity of the 3d model material for better fitted masks . 3d melt electrospinning printing can also be used to create pp microfibers with sequential layering to accurately obtain a 3d form . thus , 3d printing procedures may allow for the creation of stable and biocompatible n95 masks that are comparable to industrial manufacturing brands . figure 1 displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . \n\n face shields \n\n polycarbonate and polyester , polyvinyl chloride and other synthetic polymers are commonly used to make surgical face shields . these biomaterials are transparent , lightweight and provide high optical clarity . the polymers can easily be printed using 3d technology to meet the needs of healthcare workers treating covid-19 . \n\n covid-19 specimen collection kit \n\n creating 3d printed test swabs would help increase covid-19 testing capacity . nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs can be made from a flexible polymer , using polystyrene for the shaft . the tip can be tailored to be micro fine using computer-aided design software . thereafter , swab bud lattice fibers can be made from calcium alginate using hydrogels using 3d tissue engineering . \n\n ventilator valves \n\n ventilator valves are attachments used to deliver oxygen at fixed concentrations for patients with acute respiratory distress , including covid-19 patients . 3d printing technology can be used via a filament extrusion system or a polymer-laser powder bed fusion process to print single-use valve sets . 3d printers can design the different elements of the valve using biomaterials such as polyamide and polysulfone , polycarbonate , silicone rubber and stainless steel . furthermore , these disposable valves eliminate time-consuming sterilization . \n\n medications \n\n 3d printing techniques , such as fused filament , inkjet , extrusion and powder extrusion , allow for fabrication of 3d printed pills . medication-printing technologies typically utilize a small nozzle to lay thin disc-shaped layers of powders and deposit microscopic droplets of liquid to bind the materials . a coaxial needle extrusion 3d technology was used to print active pharmaceutical ingredients and create combinations of controlled dosing of drugs . while there are no specific antivirals or vaccines for treatment of covid-19 , several well-characterized anti-viral drugs are being considered as therapies . it may be possible to use 3d medication-printing technology to effectively and rapidly print lopinavir/ritonavir , chloroquine , and hydroxychloroquine pills . thus , 3d technology has the potential to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry , making drug research , development and production applicable to covid-19 patients . \n\n as the covid-19 outbreak rapidly evolves , there has been a personal protective equipment shortage globally . 3d printing inventions can be rapidly applied to address these deficiencies . cost , processing time , testing , and manpower are potential barriers to creating 3d-printed personal protective equipment . however , the synthetic polymer biomaterials needed for 3d-printed personal protective equipment are exact or very similar in composition to the standard manufacturing grade products ( i.e . n95 masks provides the same fluid barrier and air filtration protection ) . moreover , these synthetic polymer materials are readily available and cost effective ( i.e . polypropylene is 12.47 cents per pound ) . 3d printer costs vary but are an excellent investment with labor performed via robotics . in conjunction with flattening the curve via social distancing , this pioneering technology can provide adequate personal protective equipment for health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic . \n\n abbreviations : \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) \n\n three-dimensional ( 3d ) \n\n polypropylene ( pp ) \n\n

00010010	transmission potential of the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) onboard the diamond princess cruises ship , 2020 \n\n an outbreak of covid-19 developed aboard the princess cruises ship during january-february 2020 . using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members , we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak . our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore ( approximate range : 1.1-7 ) . our findings suggest that rt decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control . most recent estimates of rt reached values largely below the epidemic threshold , indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n introduction \n\n while the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) spread rapidly throughout china for several weeks since december 2019 , the virus had not taken off outside china in part due to the unprecedented social distancing measures that the chinese government put in place . one exception is the outbreak of covid-19 that developed aboard the diamond princess ship which was detected in early february when one of its passengers , a traveler from hong kong , tested positive for the novel coronavirus . the number of cases in the diamond princess ship quickly jumped to 454 confirmed cases by february 18 , 2020 . in contrast , the total number of cases in singapore , one of the countries with the highest number of covid-19 cases after china , was only 77 at the time . \n\n accumulating evidence indicates that the novel coronavirus can spread widely in confined settings including hospitals , cruise ships , prisons , and churches . in wuhan city , china , outbreaks inside health care settings led to the infection of hundreds of health professionals . in tokyo , japan , most of the reported infections have been linked to a party inside a traditional wooden ship , called yakatabune while most of the infections in korea have affected members of one church and one hospital . \n\n tracking the evolution of the transmission potential of covid-19 in different confined settings and how it compares with that of other respiratory diseases such influenza has public health implications . when outbreaks occur in confined settings , it is useful to investigate how the effective reproduction number changes as a result of interventions strategies such as the quarantine that the japanese government imposed on travelers and crew members aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n in this study we sought to characterize the temporal variation in the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak aboard the princess cruises ship using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data by dates of symptoms onset describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members . \n\n epidemiological incidence cases \n\n in yokohama , japan , an outbreak of covid-19 has been unfolding on board the princess cruise ship , which has been under quarantine orders since february 5 , 2020 , after a former passenger of the diamond princess ship tested positive for the virus after disembarking in hong kong . as of february 22 , 2020 , two days after the scheduled two-week quarantine came to an end , a total of 621 symptomatic and asymptomatic people including one quarantine officer , one nurse and one administrative officer tested positive for covid-19 out of the 3711 passengers and crew members on board . laboratory tests by pcr that prioritize symptomatic or high-risk groups have been conducted . \n\n incidence curves of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases of covid-19 among passengers and crew members of the outbreak unfolding aboard the princess cruises ship are publicly available from the national institute of infectious diseases , japan ( niid ) website . daily time series of symptomatic patients , from january 20 , 2020 to february 18 , 2020 were extracted . however , to reconstruct the trajectory of the epidemic , only 197 cases have dates of symptoms onset are available out of a total of 300 confirmed symptomatic cases . \n\n of the 103 symptomatic cases with missing onset dates , a total of the 79 cases are passengers while 24 cases are crew members . moreover , out of the 79 passenger cases , 30 cases were reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 21 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 28 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . of 24 crew member cases , 1 case was reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 15 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 8 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . \n\n epidemiological modeling \n\n we connected the daily incidence series with a discrete-time integral equation to describe the epidemic dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . specifically , let fs denote the probability mass function of the serial interval of covid-19 , where the serial interval is defined as the time from illness onset in the primary case to time of illness onset in the secondary case . then fs , of length s days , is given by \n\n for s > 0 , f ( s ) represents the cumulative distribution function of the gamma distribution . we characterized the expected number of new incident cases e [ ci , t ] in type i at symptom onset week t as follows , where rij denotes the average number of cases of type i infected by a single individual of type j . here we assume that the incidence , ci , t , follows a poisson sampling process with expected value e [ ci , t ] . \n\n the reproduction matrix for each type is given by \n\n this matrix is referred to as a next-generation matrix ( ngm ) in a fully susceptible population ( , pp . 873-885 ) . using this matrix , we derive the instantaneous time-dependent effective reproduction number , rt , for the entire transmission dynamics from the largest eigenvalue of the ngm . under the assumption that the per-contact infection probability and the generation interval are consistent over time regardless of the type of infection , the ngm quantifies the within type and inter-type patterns of transmission . the sum of the value in column j is the reproduction number for a specific type j . \n\n serial interval estimates of covid-19 were derived from previous studies of covid-19 , indicating that it follows a gamma distribution with the mean and sd at 7.5 and 3.4 days , respectively , based on ref .. the maximum value of the serial interval was fixed at 20 days as the cumulative probability distribution of the gamma distribution up to 20 days reaches 0.991 . \n\n we estimated model parameters and made projections using a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) method in a bayesian framework . point estimates and corresponding 95 % credibility intervals were drawn from the posterior probability distribution . all statistical analyses were conducted in r version 3.5.2 ( r foundation for statistical computing , vienna , austria ) and the 'rstan ' package ( no-u-turn-sampler ( nuts ) ) ( see table 1 ) . \n\n result \n\n day date event 1 jan/20/2020 departed from the

credibility intervals ( cri ) . \n\n total transmission includes within-type and inter-type transmission . \n\n our latest estimate of the overall rt is 0.35 ( 95 % cri : 0.02 , 2.19 ) , with only 2 % of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 . passenger and crew also have total ( within-type and inter-type ) rt values largely below the epidemic threshold , with only small percentages at 0 % and 9 % above the epidemic threshold , respectively ( table 3 ) . \n\n discussion \n\n this is the first study to assess the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak that unfolded aboard the diamond princess ship , january-february 2020 . the overall mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore in the range 1.1-7 . however , following the implementation of the quarantine period , the overall rt decreased substantially compared to values estimated during the early stage , but it exhibited fluctuations around the epidemic threshold , which likely prolonged the outbreak . \n\n our results indicate that rt declined following the quarantine measures implemented by the japanese government on february 5 relative to values during the early phase of the outbreak . importantly , only those passengers and crew who tested positive for the novel coronavirus were permitted to disembark the diamond princess ship , with more than 80 percentage of the passengers and crews still on board as of february 18 , 2020 . our latest overall estimate of rt at 0.35 ( 95 % cri : 0.02 , 2.19 ) with only 2 % of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 suggested a low probability of observing a subsequent outbreak aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n our findings indicate that the passenger-to-passenger transmission type dominated the transmission dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . the rapid increase in the overall rt from day 12 ( january 31 , 2020 ) to day 19 ( february 7 , 2020 ) is greatly influenced by the increase in passenger-to-passenger transmission , and this time period covers the time lag between february 1 , 2020 when the index covid-19 case was reported and february 5 , 2020 when the japanese government requested the passengers to stay inside their cabin after the detection of a cluster of covid-19 positive cases . upon the implementation of the quarantine orders , the overall rt and rt for passengers aboard the diamond princess ship declined thereafter , while rt among crew maintained a steady level and only started to decline on day 25 of the outbreak ( february 13 , 2020 ) . this is consistent with the fact that passengers staying inside their cabins led to a substantial decline in passenger-to-passenger transmission type except for their interaction with cabin mates . indeed , the proportion of secondary infections inside the cabins increased from 7 % ( 1/15 ) on february 6 , 43 % ( 3/7 ) on february 10 , 2020 to 100 % ( 1/1 ) on february 14 , 2020 . thus , a high proportion of the symptomatic cases after the quarantine gradually shifted from largely passenger cases to crew cases . indeed , despite their potential risk of acquiring the infection , crews had to continue to work to deliver services to isolated passengers . the distribution of the median re by transmission type suggests that other transmission types likely contributed to this outbreak to some extent ( fig . 3 ) . because one quarantine officer , one nurse , and one administrative officer contracted covid-19 aboard the diamond princess ship , the infection risk continued to be significant inside the diamond princess ship . \n\n as for the crude asymptomatic ratios by age groups , they show significant differences across age groups . however , these crude ratios are severely influenced by the timing of specimen collection relative to the infection time . hence , these ratios could be better ascertained if additional data with the timing of specimen collection becomes available . \n\n several limitations should be listed . first , a total of 103 laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases with unknown onset dates were not incorporated in our analysis . although the high proportion of unavailable data ( 34 % ( 103/300 ) ) likely influenced a downward bias in estimates of transmission potential , our estimates still point to the high transmission potential of covid-19 inside confined settings . second , it is possible that reporting delays could have influenced our latest estimates of the effective reproduction number . in fact , the us government recently sent a chartered flight to transport the american passengers on board the diamond princess ship , and after the disembarkation process , a total of 14 american passengers tested positive for the disease on february 16 , 2020 . this event also contributes to a downward bias in r although the number of cases does not exceed the peak of the outbreak , further supporting the potent transmissibility of covid-19 in confined settings . \n\n our most recent estimate of the effective reproduction number of the ongoing covid-19 epidemic on board the diamond princess ship was largely below the epidemic threshold of 1.0 , which suggested a very low probability of observing secondary outbreaks of the disease in the diamond princess ship . \n\n funding statement \n\n km acknowledges support from the japan society for the promotion of science kakenhi grant number 18k17368 and from

that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also

covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral

precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of

00001000	role of mask/respirator protection against sars-cov-2 \n\n to the editor \n\n since its outbreak on december 31 , 2019 , in wuhan , a central city in china , coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) has now spread to almost all countries in the world . it has been declared a pandemic , and it has infected over 1,041,126 people in a very short time , with 55,132 deaths as ofapril 3 , 2020 . wearing masks/respirators and practicingself-isolation at home have been recommended as guidelines for thepublic . however , the problem is the number of cases among medical personnel . interestingly , a higher risk of infection was noticed in male professionals . there are currently many types of masks/respirators available , ranging from simple surgical masks designed to protect wearers from microorganism transmission and fit loosely to the user 's face , through n95 masks used to prevent users from inhaling small airborne particles . these must fit tightly to the user 's face . masks differ primarily in their maximum internal leakage rate limit . surgical masks are designed to protect against droplets or particles with a diameter of > 100 mum , whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) virus is essentially spherical , albeit slightly pleomorphic , with a diameter of 60-140 nm and 100 times smaller than the pore diameter . thus , surgical masks can not prevent inhalation of small airborne particles ; however , both can protect users from large droplets and sprays . the pn-en 149:2001 standard defines 3 protection classes for half masks : filtering face piece 1 ( ffp1 ) , filtering face piece 2 ( ffp2 ) , and filtering face piece 3 ( ffp3 ) . the maximum internal leakage limit is 25 % for ffp1 , 11 % for ffp2 , and 5 % for ffp3 . class ffp1 masks retain about 80 % of particles smaller than 2 mum , ffp2 ones retain 94 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum , and ffp3 ones retain 99.95 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum ( table ) . \n\n test ffp1 ffp2 ffp3 concentration of harmful substances till 4 x nds till 10 x nds till 30 x nds leakage < 22 % < 8 % < 2 % penetration < 20 % < 6 % < 1 % initial expiration resistance at 95 l/min < 210 pa < 240 pa < 300 pa \n\n filtration efficiency for each class of masks \n\n abbreviations : ffp1 , filtering face piece 1 ; ffp2 , filtering face piece 2 ; ffp3 , filtering face piece 3 ; nds , the highest acceptable concentration of the harmful factor . \n\n at the moment , we may meet divergent recommendations for the use of masks . while the centers for disease control and prevention recommend the use of masks in low-risk and high-risk situations , the world health organization advises applying masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations . long et al conclude in their meta-analysis that the use of n95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza . they suggest that n95 respirators should not be recommended for the general public and non-high-risk medical staff who are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients . \n\n the potential of face masks to reduce the spread of respiratory infections could be useful . wang et al indicated that 10 of 213 medical professionals with no mask were infected by covid-19 as compared with 0 of 278 wearing n95 respirators . \n\n it is also worth noting that the respirator increases resistance to inhalation . the longer they are used , the more difficult breathing becomes because of more absorbed dust . what is more , the effectiveness decreases with the increase of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the respirator and face ( the so-called dead space ) . the concentration of carbon dioxide in the dead space increases with each subsequent exhalation . therefore , masks should be replaced frequently . additionally , to improve the comfort of use , masks use 1-way exhalation valves , which accelerate the circulation of gases.6 \n\n to conclude , the use of protective masks can and should be the first protection against sars-cov-2 transmission to medical personnel . medical personnel should use class ffp3 masks . additionally , the application of visors to cover the entire face during contact with the patient is worth considering . \n\n references \n\n association between 2019-ncov transmission and n95 respirator use . \n\n comparison of performance of three different types of respiratory protection devices . \n\n protecting healthcare staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome : filtration capacity of multiple surgical masks . \n\n a close shave ? performance of p2/n95 respirators in health care workers with facial hair : results of the beards ( adequate respiratory defences ) study . \n\n effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza : a systematic review and meta-analysis . \n\n cloth masks versus medical masks for covid-19 .

00001000	role of mask/respirator protection against sars-cov-2 \n\n to the editor \n\n since its outbreak on december 31 , 2019 , in wuhan , a central city in china , coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) has now spread to almost all countries in the world . it has been declared a pandemic , and it has infected over 1,041,126 people in a very short time , with 55,132 deaths as ofapril 3 , 2020 . wearing masks/respirators and practicingself-isolation at home have been recommended as guidelines for thepublic . however , the problem is the number of cases among medical personnel . interestingly , a higher risk of infection was noticed in male professionals . there are currently many types of masks/respirators available , ranging from simple surgical masks designed to protect wearers from microorganism transmission and fit loosely to the user 's face , through n95 masks used to prevent users from inhaling small airborne particles . these must fit tightly to the user 's face . masks differ primarily in their maximum internal leakage rate limit . surgical masks are designed to protect against droplets or particles with a diameter of > 100 mum , whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) virus is essentially spherical , albeit slightly pleomorphic , with a diameter of 60-140 nm and 100 times smaller than the pore diameter . thus , surgical masks can not prevent inhalation of small airborne particles ; however , both can protect users from large droplets and sprays . the pn-en 149:2001 standard defines 3 protection classes for half masks : filtering face piece 1 ( ffp1 ) , filtering face piece 2 ( ffp2 ) , and filtering face piece 3 ( ffp3 ) . the maximum internal leakage limit is 25 % for ffp1 , 11 % for ffp2 , and 5 % for ffp3 . class ffp1 masks retain about 80 % of particles smaller than 2 mum , ffp2 ones retain 94 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum , and ffp3 ones retain 99.95 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum ( table ) . \n\n test ffp1 ffp2 ffp3 concentration of harmful substances till 4 x nds till 10 x nds till 30 x nds leakage < 22 % < 8 % < 2 % penetration < 20 % < 6 % < 1 % initial expiration resistance at 95 l/min < 210 pa < 240 pa < 300 pa \n\n filtration efficiency for each class of masks \n\n abbreviations : ffp1 , filtering face piece 1 ; ffp2 , filtering face piece 2 ; ffp3 , filtering face piece 3 ; nds , the highest acceptable concentration of the harmful factor . \n\n at the moment , we may meet divergent recommendations for the use of masks . while the centers for disease control and prevention recommend the use of masks in low-risk and high-risk situations , the world health organization advises applying masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations . long et al conclude in their meta-analysis that the use of n95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza . they suggest that n95 respirators should not be recommended for the general public and non-high-risk medical staff who are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients . \n\n the potential of face masks to reduce the spread of respiratory infections could be useful . wang et al indicated that 10 of 213 medical professionals with no mask were infected by covid-19 as compared with 0 of 278 wearing n95 respirators . \n\n it is also worth noting that the respirator increases resistance to inhalation . the longer they are used , the more difficult breathing becomes because of more absorbed dust . what is more , the effectiveness decreases with the increase of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the respirator and face ( the so-called dead space ) . the concentration of carbon dioxide in the dead space increases with each subsequent exhalation . therefore , masks should be replaced frequently . additionally , to improve the comfort of use , masks use 1-way exhalation valves , which accelerate the circulation of gases.6 \n\n to conclude , the use of protective masks can and should be the first protection against sars-cov-2 transmission to medical personnel . medical personnel should use class ffp3 masks . additionally , the application of visors to cover the entire face during contact with the patient is worth considering . \n\n references \n\n association between 2019-ncov transmission and n95 respirator use . \n\n comparison of performance of three different types of respiratory protection devices . \n\n protecting healthcare staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome : filtration capacity of multiple surgical masks . \n\n a close shave ? performance of p2/n95 respirators in health care workers with facial hair : results of the beards ( adequate respiratory defences ) study . \n\n effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza : a systematic review and meta-analysis . \n\n cloth masks versus medical masks for covid-19 . 
00001000	emergency trauma care during the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in china \n\n background \n\n a novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in wuhan , hubei province , in december 2019 ; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans . china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease . however , a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking . to regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak , we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in wuhan . \n\n main body \n\n the article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 , indications for emergency surgery , and infection prevention and control for medical personnel , providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period . \n\n conclusions \n\n the measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of covid-19 . \n\n background \n\n a novel corona virus disease ( covid-19 ) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) began in wuhan , hubei province , china , in december 2019 . by february 13 , 2020 , more than 60,000 cases were confirmed , nearly 50,000 in hubei alone , and the source of the infection was yet to be definitely determined . the world health organization ( who ) has declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) . considering the current rate of human to human transmission , most countries in the world should be well prepared for the potential global covid-19 pandemic . china is on the frontline in the fight against the virus , and medical staff have become exhausted due to the excessive workload brought on by the outbreak . medical testing tools and personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , such as face shields , goggles , and gloves , have become scarce and have had to be rationed among teams and medical centers , with severe shortage in hubei , the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak . a report from a neurosurgery department of a teaching hospital in wuhan showed that from december 25 , 2019 , to february 6 , 2020 , eight covid-19 suspected patients were admitted , and three were confirmed . consequently , 12 medical personnel were infected ( 11 nurses and one doctor ) , among whom three had been in close contact with the first confirmed case . according to the data released by the national health commission ( nhc ) of the people 's republic of china , a total of 1716 medical personnel infections had been reported nationwide , accounting for 3.8 % of the total confirmed cases by 24:00 on february 11 , 2020 , of which six ( 0.4 % ) had died . of these , hubei province reported 1502 cases , accounting for 87.5 % of the total medical personnel infections , while wuhan city reported 1102 cases , accounting for 73.4 % . notably , medical personnel are the most valuable resource during the outbreak . how to protect them from infection is one of the foremost challenges in the fight against sars-cov-2 . \n\n although china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of sars-cov-2 , severe trauma can still occur . during the outbreak , the population of trauma patients may be diverse in terms of infection status , including patients who were previously healthy , suspected to be infected , confirmed infected , close contacts of infected individuals , and asymptomatic carriers . thus , balancing optimal trauma care while preventing further spread of the viral infection during the outbreak is a major challenge . \n\n to our knowledge , there is no relevant consensus or clinical guideline available on the indications of , timing of or perioperative protection during emergency surgery for trauma . to protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of trauma care , we have summarized the recommended perioperative infection prevention and control measures for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 based on current practical experience in china and the published literature on surgical practice during the past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) , ebola virus , and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n main text \n\n general principles \n\n special requirements for the hospitals receiving trauma patients during the outbreak \n\n emergency department : set up a triage area for assessment of all patients at admission , allowing early recognition of possible sars-cov-2 infection and immediate isolation of patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection in an area separate from other patients . \n\n radiology department : a dedicated ct room should be kept on standby for the examination of infected patients . \n\n operating room ( or ) : a relatively isolated negative-pressure or is preferable ; if there is no permanent negative-pressure or , a temporarily modified negative-pressure or the main operating suite of the hospital can be converted . \n\n intensive care unit ( icu ) : an isolated area should be prepared in the icu , and suspected patients should be treated in a single space . \n\n intrahospital transport : although an ideal trauma center with a door-to-door ct room and negative-pressure or are preferable in this situation , most regions in china do not operate such facilities . therefore , a predetermined transport route should be used to minimize exposure , and any intrahospital transport should utilize dedicated carts demarcated by a warning logo equipped with protective supplies and hand disinfectants . the patient should wear a medical mask , and the walls and the floor of the passageways and the elevator should be covered with a plastic lining . \n\n to control the spread of covid-19 , basic principles for treating infectious diseases should be followed , and necessary measures should be taken before receiving trauma patients . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n precaution level applicable personnel and scenarios personal protective equipment level 1 triage , emergency department clean non-sterile long gown , disposable head cover , disposable medical mask , and gloves . level 2 close contact with suspected patients , or handling secretions , feces , and personal items belonging to patients ; performing ct scan ( fig . 1 ) disposable head cover , gloves , disposable coverall , n95 respirator or equivalent , goggle or face shield , rubber boots or fluid-resistant overshoes , etc . level 3 close contact with suspected patients , or collecting blood , respiratory tract samples of patients , especially for endotracheal intubation , airway care , and sputum suction , as well as emergency surgery ( fig . 2 ) . on the basis of wearing secondary protective equipment such as goggle or face shield , other protective equipment should be strengthened . for instance , adding disposable surgical clothing and gloves in addition to disposable coverall and gloves . two layers of gloves covering protective clothing and surgical clothes sleeves , respectively , use of a powered air purifying respirator ( papr ) . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n to standardize and simplify the precaution measures and equipment required for different personnel and scenarios in trauma care , we adopted a three-level precaution protocol in trauma care ( table 1 ) . \n\n all levels of precaution were based on implementing standard precautions , including hand hygiene , respiratory hygiene , and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment ( ppe ) according to different risk levels . proper training of the standard donning and doffing procedures is the basis of effective protection . in epidemic areas such as hubei province , all patients can be regarded as potentially suspected patients during the outbreak , and the level of the precaution should be elevated . \n\n triage \n\n classification of the patients suspected cases clinical confirmed cases ( hubei only ) pathogenic confirmed cases diagnostic basis outside hubei province : two of the clinical manifestations with at least one of the epidemiological histories , three of the clinical manifestations without epidemiological history suspected patient in hubei province with ct findings of pneumonia suspected or clinically confirmed patients with at least one pathogenic evidence epidemiological investigation 1 . travel to or residence in wuhan in the 14 days prior to symptom onset ; 2 . close contactb with sars-cov-2 infection ( rrt-pcr positive ) within 14 days before onset ; 3 . exposed to patients from wuhan and surrounding areas , or from a community with patients who reported fever or respiratory symptoms14 d before onset ; 4 . clustering outbreak . - - clinical manifestations and ct scan 1 . fever and/or respiratory symptoms ; 2 . imaging characteristics of covid-19 ( ct : multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes in early stage , which are obvious in the peripheral lung , and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs , and lung consolidation may occur in severe cases ) ; 3 . the total number of white blood cells in the early stage is normal or decreased , and the lymphocyte count is decreased - - pathogenic evidence null null 1 . detection of sars-cov-2 in respiratory specimens and sera by rrt-pcr assays ; 2 . by virus dna sequencing , respiratory or blood samples dna sequence highly homologous with sars-cov-2 . \n\n diagnostic criteria of covid-19a \n\n covid-19 coronavirus induced disease , sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 , rrt-pcr real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \n\n athe diagnostic criteria were defined according to guidance for the diagnosis and management for covid-19 ( 5th edition ) released by national health commission of people 's republic of china in feb. 4 , 2020 \n\n bclose contact is defined as follows : \n\n - healthcare-associated exposure , including providing direct care for covid-19 patients , working with healthcare workers infected with novel coronavirus , visiting patients , or staying in the same close environment as a covid-19 patient \n\n - working together in close proximity or sharing the same classroom environment with a covid-19 patient \n\n - traveling together with a covid-19 patient in any kind of conveyance \n\n - living in the same household as a covid-19 patient \n\n trauma patients during the outbreak should be managed using the relevant contents in table 2 , and they should complete a brief epidemiological investigation at the triage stage . however , the trauma patients ' history may be unreliable , as they may not have time to be detailed . more emphasis should be placed on the objective data . during the outbreak in wuhan , a total of 32 emergency operations were performed in a tertiary care hospital , including 19 suspected and seven pathogenic confirmed cases . in addition , nine covid-19 patients in another tertiary care hospital underwent gastrointestinal surgery , but in all of these patients , covid-19 was diagnosed postoperatively . it is worth noting that there have been many cases of asymptomatic patients with an incubation period . the maximum incubation period was reported to be 24 days . \n\n evaluation \n\n trauma care is highly time dependent and requires rapid and effective evaluation and management . during the outbreak , primary and secondary surveys should be completed while maintaining the premise of effective protection . \n\n general principles of evaluation \n\n dynamic evaluation strategies should be conducted throughout the trauma care process . the personal protective equipment ( ppe ) worn by medical personnel may result in limited or incomplete physical examinations ( such as palpation and auscultation ) . therefore , injury assessment may rely on radiological examinations . \n\n radiology evaluation \n\n a chest ct scan is recommended for all severe trauma patients if there is no contraindication . if the chest ct scan is not possible due to critical condition , the patient should be treated as a suspect for infection until infection is excluded . \n\n level 3 ppe during ct examination \n\n if the hospital has a trauma resuscitation unit , complete x-ray including but not limited to the chest and focused assessment with sonography for trauma ( fast ) in the trauma resuscitation unit should be performed . for hemodynamic stabilization , a ct scan including but not limited to the chest should be performed ( fig . 1 ) . if the hospital does not have a trauma resuscitation unit , patients with hemodynamic instability should be resuscitated in the emergency department and undergo fast simultaneously . once the hemodynamic status is stable enough , the ct scan should be performed as soon as possible . \n\n ct scan protocol for trauma patients suspected of having covid-19 : medical personnel should first determine the method and scope of the scan , including but not limited to the chest , according to the mechanism of injury . for stab wounds , the segment and body cavity near the wound should be examined . for gunshot wounds , due to the high kinetic energy of the projectiles , the tortuous wound path , and the heavy tissue damage , the scanning range should be expanded appropriately . patients who have sustained blunt injuries with high energy , such as traffic injuries , should usually be scanned with enhanced scanning ranging from head to mid-thigh ( including the whole lower limb when there is lower limb injury ) . enhanced scanning is helpful in providing further information on organ injury , and three-dimensional reconstruction of blood vessels and bone should be performed when major vascular and bone injury is suspected . \n\n ct features of covid-19 : it should be noted that the pulmonary imaging changes of covid-19 vary depending on the patient 's age , immunity status , stage of disease at the time of the scan , underlying disease , and drug intervention . reports have shown that in the early stage of infection , ct shows multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes , which are obvious in the peripheral lung and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs . in severe cases , lung consolidation could occur . in addition , special attention should be paid to discerning between covid-19 infection and pulmonary contusion . \n\n blood and pathogen specimen collection \n\n if possible , nasopharyngeal swabs , sputum , lower respiratory tract secretions , and blood samples should be collected and sent for rrt-pcr in the emergency period . if no respiratory tract specimens are collected before the operation due to time constraints , they can be collected during or after the operation . \n\n all specimens shall be deemed to be potentially infectious . collection , transportation , and processing of any clinical specimens should be performed by biological safety training qualified medical staff . level 3 precautions should be adopted to minimize the possibility of exposure . \n\n the results of rrt-pcr may be falsely negative due to the influence of sampling , transportation , extraction , and testing . recent observations have shown that 30 to 40 % of patients with covid-19 ct features were rrt-pcr negative . as a result , the protection standard can not be lowered due to negative results . since the rrt-pcr test can take several hours to confirm the diagnosis , chest ct is recommended as the basis for the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 in suspected patients , especially in areas with a high incidence of the disease . the use of chest ct not only helps to control the spread of the epidemic but can also ensure definitive care for trauma injuries in a timely manner . \n\n emergency surgery \n\n emergency surgery is of great importance for severe trauma patients , the aim of which includes hemorrhage control , contamination abatement , and compartment pressure relief as soon as possible . effective prevention of sars-cov-2 transmission by standard intraoperative protective measures is an important indicator of a successful operation . from the available evidence , sars-cov-2 is spread mainly through respiratory droplets and contact , while aerosol and fecal-oral transmission are still under investigation . from the existing evidence and our practical experience , all medical staff should adopt level 3 precautions when entering the or . \n\n or preparation \n\n an independent negative pressure operation room is the first choice . operations can only be performed when the pressure is between - 10 and - 5 pa . if a negative pressure or is not available , a relatively isolated or with an independent purification system is an alternative option . nevertheless , the purification system should be shut down during the operation , and a final disinfection should be performed postoperatively . as in standard trauma protocols , the more critical patient should be operated on first . if two or more suspected or confirmed infected patients arrive in the or , a 30-min disinfection is warranted before the subsequent operation . the dedicated or should be clearly marked as covid-19 exclusive . \n\n the dedicated covid-19 or should be designed with a special passage and elevator . the design should focus on shortening the outdoor distance , reducing the chance of human contact , and limiting the time spent in suspected contaminated areas . materials and equipment should only be delivered by specially assigned staff . people inside the or are not allowed to leave during the operation , and outdoor personnel should not enter without permission . surgical articles should be clearly identified , and the use of disposable items is recommended . to maintain pressure , surgical supplies ( surgical instruments , dressings , single-use consumables , high-value consumables , medications , and relevant items ) should be well prepared in advance . only unidirectional flow is permitted ( nothing should be taken out once it is entered during the operation ) . personnel movement and the frequency of door opening are strictly limited . nondisposable items should be disposed of postoperatively in strict accordance with regulations . two suction apparatuses are optimal , one of which is for exclusive use by the anesthesiologist . the negative pressure aspirator should be immediately placed on the patient 's face to minimize the spread of respiratory secretions after entering the operation room . \n\n ppe for operation personnel \n\n protective clothing for surgical personnel : a after wearing protective clothing and inner gloves , b after wearing operating clothes and outer gloves \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe donning \n\n the topic of intraoperative protection remains controversial because most surgeons have no experience performing surgery while wearing heavy and airproof contagion gowns and goggles . according to practice in china , some medical personnel wore two surgical gowns , two contagion gowns and four pairs of gloves for surgery during the covid-19 epidemic . instead of enhancing protective effects , such excessive protection can reduce the visual , auditory , and tactile sensitivity of the surgeon , thus reducing the precision of surgical operations ( fig . 2 ) . the influence of excessive protection on the surgeon mainly includes ( 1 ) difficulty breathing , ( 2 ) fog on goggles and face shields that interfere with vision , ( 3 ) constriction of visual fields , ( 4 ) loss of flexibility due to multiple layers of gloves , and ( 5 ) double or triple the duration of the operation . a practical lesson had been learned from the case of a 7-year-old girl with suspected covid-19 infection who was subjected to an urgent craniotomy due to obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a third ventricle germ cell-derived tumor . the surgical team adopted a level 3 precaution including n95 respirators or papr , and full coverage with protective gowns ( shoe covers included ) and sterile surgical gowns . consequently , an operation that would have taken 2-3 h ended up taking 10 h. possible solutions for reducing the impact of ppe on surgery include reducing the or temperature ( minimizing the formation of moisture on goggles ) and enhancing the lighting in the room to obtain better vision . all ppes are fit for single use except papr . the steps of donning and doffing should be completed under professional supervision ( fig . 3 ) . \n\n anesthesia \n\n regional nerve block is the first choice for limb surgeries . general anesthesia is recommended for neurosurgery , torso trauma , or multiple trauma with shock . \n\n attention should be paid to avoid aerosol generation caused by coughing and other causes in airway operations . intubation should be performed after rapid induction and full muscle relaxation to ensure complete disappearance of spontaneous breathing , and sputum aspiration before intubation should be avoided . remote endotracheal intubation by disposable glide scope with an assistant is recommended . awake endotracheal intubation is not recommended for patients with a difficult airway , hypoxia , or unconsciousness . if face mask or laryngeal mask ventilation is able to maintain oxygenation , multiple tools ( fiberoptic bronchoscope , glide scope , light stick , laryngeal mask ) can be used to assist endotracheal intubation after rapid induction of general anesthesia . if not , cricothyroid laryngotomy should be performed without any hesitation . rapid induction via oral intubation is recommended in cases of a possibly full stomach . mask positive pressure ventilation after administration should be avoided . no emetic measure is recommended . extra caution should be taken on when a nasogastric tube is in place . covid-19 can cause pulmonary inflammation that can induce added lung injury , restricted crystal fluid , and protective ventilation . the proper mechanical ventilation parameters include limited tidal volume ( < 8 ml/kg ) and airway pressure ( platform pressure < 30 cm h2o ) ; 5-10 cm h2o positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation ( peep ) is optional for alveoli expansion and oxygenation maintenance . permissive hypercapnia is also acceptable . \n\n surgical strategy \n\n the concept of damage control surgery should be followed to simplify the operation . it is optimal to finish an operation within 90 min , and strategies such as packing hemostasis , external fixation , and temporary abdominal closure are helpful to shorten the operation time . surgical personnel should be highly focused and closely coordinated . gentle movement is essential to avoid accidental injury and contamination caused by the spattering of blood , fluid , and bone debris . limiting rinsing and drainage of bodily fluids is another key to effectively reducing intraoperative contamination . reliable hemostasis should be maintained to prevent bleeding around the incision . excessive negative pressure suction and violent operations are prohibited . it is also suggested that electrotome use is not suitable under this scenario ; if it must be used , the power should be minimized . smoke should be quickly suctioned to avoid aerosol generation . \n\n postoperative management \n\n postoperative management of patients \n\n after the operation , the patient should be transferred to an isolation ward in the icu . the endotracheal tubes should be removed under analgesia to avoid violent coughing while the patient is stable . sputum aspiration should be performed by a closed suction system . trauma and surgery can impair the patient 's immune function . clinically , some asymptomatic covid-19 patients suffered rapid deterioration after surgery . surgeons and anesthesiologists should be aware that acute lung injury caused by covid-19 may exist preoperatively or worsen postoperatively . therefore , special attention should be paid to the monitoring of body temperature , infection , and hemodynamic index . reexamination of chest ct and rrt-pcr tests is also important . for postoperative trauma patients with fever , traumatic , or operative complications should also be considered to differentiate them from covid-19 . attention should be paid to symptomatic and etiological treatment . postoperative dyspnea and hypoxia should also be differentiated from complications such as pulmonary embolism . nutritional support and prevention of other complications ( bacterial infection , stress ulcer , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , and deep venous thrombosis ) should also be strengthened . \n\n quarantine \n\n based on current experience , if the medical personnel complete the operation successfully and comply with all the regulations without any accidental exposure , the patient does not need to be quarantined . otherwise , a 14-day medical observation is obligatory , and timely treatment is needed when any abnormalities occur . notably , some literature recommends a routine 14-day quarantine for relevant personnel involved in the operation for sars-cov-2 confirmed patients . however , extreme safety often results in severe incapacity to help patients , so a balance between safety and efficiency must be maintained . \n\n discussion \n\n the national health commission of china initially decided to temporarily call the disease novel coronavirus pneumonia or ncp . it was not until february 12 , 2020 , that the official name covid-19 was announced by the who . shortly after the who announced the disease 's official name , the virus causing it was named sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , highlighting the new virus 's similarity to the sars virus identified in 2003 . based on epidemiological data up to jan. 4 , 2020 , the estimated r0 was 2.2 ( 95 % ci , 1.4 to 3.9 ) , while the latest study surveying cases up to feb. 14 , 2020 , further calculated that the r0 of covid-19 was 3.77 . therefore , researchers estimated that in terms of infection ability , sars-cov-2 was slightly higher than the sars virus and significantly higher than the mers-cov . according to clinical characteristic analysis of sars-cov-2 infection in china , the mortality was 2.01 % out of 28,018 cases as of feb. 6 , 2020 . by human-to-human transmission , sars-cov-2 had spread rapidly from wuhan , china , to 24 other countries as of feb. 12 , 2020 . the number of cases within china and other countries is rapidly increasing , and it is estimated that for every additional 10 % decrease in transmission rate , the peak population will be reduced by 20-47 % . the cumulative number of infected cases and deaths will be reduced by 23-49 % due to comprehensive interventions . if current interventions continue , it is expected that the number of people infected will peak in early march 2020 . based on the epidemiological analysis , only 1.18 % of the patients had direct contact with wild animals , 31.30 % of the patients had been in wuhan , and 71.80 % of the patients had contact with people from wuhan . common symptoms included fever , cough , and diarrhea . a total of 76.4 % of patients had radiologic findings manifested as pneumonia , with the remaining patients exhibiting normal radiologic findings . poor clinical outcomes can be predicted by disease severity , including oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count , and chest ct manifestations . \n\n the transmission by aerosols is still under investigation . aerosols are solid , liquid , solid , and liquid granular substances suspended in the air , such as dust , smoke , fog , and microorganisms . these may be the `` flying vehicles '' for covid-19 . covid-19 aerosols are related to the increased risk of covid-19 transmission . tracheal intubation , noninvasive ventilation , tracheotomy , manual ventilation before intubation , bronchoscopy , cardiopulmonary resuscitation , sputum suction , and other airway operations , as well as the use of electrotome , suction , and drainage , all inevitably produce a large number of aerosols . when carrying out these operations , the protection and training of medical personnel should be strengthened , and preventive measures to protect against aerosols are recommended , including n95 respirators , papr , goggles or face shields , disposable fluid-resistant gowns , and limiting the number of people in the room . \n\n based on experience from the hospital in wuhan , patients with covid-19 have high mortality after surgery . as of february 14 , 2020 , 6 gastrointestinal operations were performed in the general surgery department of the authors ' hospital ; one 60-year-old male died of respiratory failure 14 days after surgery , and one died of septic shock , for a mortality rate of 33.33 % . another group of eight covid-19 confirmed patients in zhongnan hospital of wuhan university underwent gastrointestinal surgeries ( seven gastrointestinal tumors and one benign case ) ; one patient died of covid-19 after left hemicolectomy with the diagnosis of postoperative recurrence of renal cancer involving the descending colon with intestinal obstruction , and one tumor patient died from postoperative complications of abdominal infection , for a mortality rate of 25 % . trauma patients usually have massive hemorrhage , shock , and contamination . damage control strategies should be complied with to correct fatal triads caused by hypothermia , acidosis , and coagulopathy . meanwhile , effective oxygen therapy and organ function support are also indispensable . \n\n moreover , additional attention should be paid to patients in critical condition and to those who develop severe pneumonia after trauma . among covid-19 patients , critical patients , including patients with respiratory failure , septic shock , and other organ failures , have accounted for 29 % ~32 % . identifying high-risk groups with severe illness can also help reduce the occurrence of poor prognosis . the possible high-risk groups include patients over 65 years old , patients with obesity , and patients with other diseases ( such as chronic pulmonary disease , hypertension , heart disease , kidney disease , diabetes , tumor , and immune deficiency ) . \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe doffing \n\n the covid-19 outbreak poses significant challenges to hospital staff and specifically trauma surgeons , which must offer optimal and timely care despite the circumstances . strict safety protocols must be adhered to when carrying out emergency care for patients with severe trauma and other surgical diseases , which means that all the measures shall be carried out to preserve the ability of the medical staff to achieve the purpose of effective care without sacrificing the safety of all involved . the perspectives in this paper can not be a substitute for clinical judgment and expert consultation but can help provide up-to-date guidance on the clinical management of emergency surgery for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 ( fig . 4 ) . \n\n conclusion \n\n in conclusion , the covid-19 outbreak raises several issues concerning the safety of medical personnel and patients . areas with high incidence rates of covid-19 should conduct operations with caution and protection should be strengthened while ensuring suitable facilities to carry out optimal care with maximal safety . with the accumulation of clinical experience and in-depth research , some of the practices may require modification when additional

00001000	applications of 3d printing technology to address covid-19 related supply shortages \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) was first identified in an outbreak in wuhan , china on december 8 , 2019 . globally , the number of affected covid-19 patients is growing exponentially , with the death toll exceeding 27,300 as of march 27 , 2020 . worldwide , there is a limited supply of n95 respirator masks , face shields , ventilator valves , testing kits and other personal protective equipment . thus , adequate production and distribution of personal protective equipment is critical during this pandemic . to address these shortages , three-dimensional ( 3d ) printing , a novel and innovative technology used to fabricate complex architectures , is well suited . 3d printing is an adjustable , robotic platform allowing for tailored deposition of biomaterials using computer-aided design systems to formulate layer-by-layer custom designs with controlled architecture and composition . \n\n masks \n\n n95 respirators masks have two advantages over surgical , paper or cloth masks : 1 ) they are > 95 % efficient at filtering 0.3-microm airborne particles and 2 ) they are fit tested to each user to ensure an adequate seal , such that air and small droplets do not enter around the edges of the mask and into the health care worker 's breathing zone . the centers for disease control and prevention recommends n95 masks for health care workers taking care of patients with covid-19 . \n\n 3d printing can be used to produce tailored seal designs for improving mask comfort and fit . to customize face mask seals , 3d laser scanning can be implemented to scan exact facial parameters , with a tailored and customized face seal n95 template . anthropometric data of the chin arc , jawline , face and nose lengths , and nose protrusion measurements can be taken into account with this customized seal . in a study using face seal prototypes with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic using a fused deposition modeling 3d printer , three subjects showed improved contact pressure compared with use of 3m 8210 n95 ffr respirator masks . moreover , a personalized mask may account for facial hair length and density for a more precise fit . \n\n displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . the biomaterials displayed in this image have been fully characterized in the medical literature , with the same material composition of n95 masks . the mask includes several layers thereby ensure effective filtration of viral particles . \n\n figure 1 \n\n standard n95 masks consist of filtration material composed of electrostatic non-woven polypropylene ( pp ) fibers which are semi-rigid , lightweight and fatigue resistant . the semi-crystalline structure may cause significant distortion of the 3d printed parts upon cooling thereby making 3d printing difficult . material extrusion 3d printing was used to design a 3d printable thermoplastic elastomeric material from a blend of polypropylene ( pp ) and styrene- ( ethylene-butylene ) -styrene ( sebs ) . this blend provides better printability and flexibility for n95 mask design . pp is commonly used for various industrial applications due to its low cost , processability , printability , recyclability and mechanical integrity . sebs is a polymeric elastomer with low processing temperature and low distortion during extrusion . thus , the pp/sebs combination would improve the processability of 3d printed n95 masks . moreover , controlling the thermoplastic elastomer ratio allows for tailoring the flexibility and elasticity of the 3d model material for better fitted masks . 3d melt electrospinning printing can also be used to create pp microfibers with sequential layering to accurately obtain a 3d form . thus , 3d printing procedures may allow for the creation of stable and biocompatible n95 masks that are comparable to industrial manufacturing brands . figure 1 displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . \n\n face shields \n\n polycarbonate and polyester , polyvinyl chloride and other synthetic polymers are commonly used to make surgical face shields . these biomaterials are transparent , lightweight and provide high optical clarity . the polymers can easily be printed using 3d technology to meet the needs of healthcare workers treating covid-19 . \n\n covid-19 specimen collection kit \n\n creating 3d printed test swabs would help increase covid-19 testing capacity . nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs can be made from a flexible polymer , using polystyrene for the shaft . the tip can be tailored to be micro fine using computer-aided design software . thereafter , swab bud lattice fibers can be made from calcium alginate using hydrogels using 3d tissue engineering . \n\n ventilator valves \n\n ventilator valves are attachments used to deliver oxygen at fixed concentrations for patients with acute respiratory distress , including covid-19 patients . 3d printing technology can be used via a filament extrusion system or a polymer-laser powder bed fusion process to print single-use valve sets . 3d printers can design the different elements of the valve using biomaterials such as polyamide and polysulfone , polycarbonate , silicone rubber and stainless steel . furthermore , these disposable valves eliminate time-consuming sterilization . \n\n medications \n\n 3d printing techniques , such as fused filament , inkjet , extrusion and powder extrusion , allow for fabrication of 3d printed pills . medication-printing technologies typically utilize a small nozzle to lay thin disc-shaped layers of powders and deposit microscopic droplets of liquid to bind the materials . a coaxial needle extrusion 3d technology was used to print active pharmaceutical ingredients and create combinations of controlled dosing of drugs . while there are no specific antivirals or vaccines for treatment of covid-19 , several well-characterized anti-viral drugs are being considered as therapies . it may be possible to use 3d medication-printing technology to effectively and rapidly print lopinavir/ritonavir , chloroquine , and hydroxychloroquine pills . thus , 3d technology has the potential to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry , making drug research , development and production applicable to covid-19 patients . \n\n as the covid-19 outbreak rapidly evolves , there has been a personal protective equipment shortage globally . 3d printing inventions can be rapidly applied to address these deficiencies . cost , processing time , testing , and manpower are potential barriers to creating 3d-printed personal protective equipment . however , the synthetic polymer biomaterials needed for 3d-printed personal protective equipment are exact or very similar in composition to the standard manufacturing grade products ( i.e . n95 masks provides the same fluid barrier and air filtration protection ) . moreover , these synthetic polymer materials are readily available and cost effective ( i.e . polypropylene is 12.47 cents per pound ) . 3d printer costs vary but are an excellent investment with labor performed via robotics . in conjunction with flattening the curve via social distancing , this pioneering technology can provide adequate personal protective equipment for health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic . \n\n abbreviations : \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) \n\n three-dimensional ( 3d ) \n\n polypropylene ( pp ) \n\n

00010010	transmission potential of the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) onboard the diamond princess cruises ship , 2020 \n\n an outbreak of covid-19 developed aboard the princess cruises ship during january-february 2020 . using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members , we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak . our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore ( approximate range : 1.1-7 ) . our findings suggest that rt decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control . most recent estimates of rt reached values largely below the epidemic threshold , indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n introduction \n\n while the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) spread rapidly throughout china for several weeks since december 2019 , the virus had not taken off outside china in part due to the unprecedented social distancing measures that the chinese government put in place . one exception is the outbreak of covid-19 that developed aboard the diamond princess ship which was detected in early february when one of its passengers , a traveler from hong kong , tested positive for the novel coronavirus . the number of cases in the diamond princess ship quickly jumped to 454 confirmed cases by february 18 , 2020 . in contrast , the total number of cases in singapore , one of the countries with the highest number of covid-19 cases after china , was only 77 at the time . \n\n accumulating evidence indicates that the novel coronavirus can spread widely in confined settings including hospitals , cruise ships , prisons , and churches . in wuhan city , china , outbreaks inside health care settings led to the infection of hundreds of health professionals . in tokyo , japan , most of the reported infections have been linked to a party inside a traditional wooden ship , called yakatabune while most of the infections in korea have affected members of one church and one hospital . \n\n tracking the evolution of the transmission potential of covid-19 in different confined settings and how it compares with that of other respiratory diseases such influenza has public health implications . when outbreaks occur in confined settings , it is useful to investigate how the effective reproduction number changes as a result of interventions strategies such as the quarantine that the japanese government imposed on travelers and crew members aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n in this study we sought to characterize the temporal variation in the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak aboard the princess cruises ship using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data by dates of symptoms onset describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members . \n\n epidemiological incidence cases \n\n in yokohama , japan , an outbreak of covid-19 has been unfolding on board the princess cruise ship , which has been under quarantine orders since february 5 , 2020 , after a former passenger of the diamond princess ship tested positive for the virus after disembarking in hong kong . as of february 22 , 2020 , two days after the scheduled two-week quarantine came to an end , a total of 621 symptomatic and asymptomatic people including one quarantine officer , one nurse and one administrative officer tested positive for covid-19 out of the 3711 passengers and crew members on board . laboratory tests by pcr that prioritize symptomatic or high-risk groups have been conducted . \n\n incidence curves of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases of covid-19 among passengers and crew members of the outbreak unfolding aboard the princess cruises ship are publicly available from the national institute of infectious diseases , japan ( niid ) website . daily time series of symptomatic patients , from january 20 , 2020 to february 18 , 2020 were extracted . however , to reconstruct the trajectory of the epidemic , only 197 cases have dates of symptoms onset are available out of a total of 300 confirmed symptomatic cases . \n\n of the 103 symptomatic cases with missing onset dates , a total of the 79 cases are passengers while 24 cases are crew members . moreover , out of the 79 passenger cases , 30 cases were reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 21 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 28 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . of 24 crew member cases , 1 case was reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 15 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 8 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . \n\n epidemiological modeling \n\n we connected the daily incidence series with a discrete-time integral equation to describe the epidemic dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . specifically , let fs denote the probability mass function of the serial interval of covid-19 , where the serial interval is defined as the time from illness onset in the primary case to time of illness onset in the secondary case . then fs , of length s days , is given by \n\n for s > 0 , f ( s ) represents the cumulative distribution function of the gamma distribution . we characterized the expected number of new incident cases e [ ci , t ] in type i at symptom onset week t as follows , where rij denotes the average number of cases of type i infected by a single individual of type j . here we assume that the incidence , ci , t , follows a poisson sampling process with expected value e [ ci , t ] . \n\n the reproduction matrix for each type is given by \n\n this matrix is referred to as a next-generation matrix ( ngm ) in a fully susceptible population ( , pp . 873-885 ) . using this matrix , we derive the instantaneous time-dependent effective reproduction number , rt , for the entire transmission dynamics from the largest eigenvalue of the ngm . under the assumption that the per-contact infection probability and the generation interval are consistent over time regardless of the type of infection , the ngm quantifies the within type and inter-type patterns of transmission . the sum of the value in column j is the reproduction number for a specific type j . \n\n serial interval estimates of covid-19 were derived from previous studies of covid-19 , indicating that it follows a gamma distribution with the mean and sd at 7.5 and 3.4 days , respectively , based on ref .. the maximum value of the serial interval was fixed at 20 days as the cumulative probability distribution of the gamma distribution up to 20 days reaches 0.991 . \n\n we estimated model parameters and made projections using a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) method in a bayesian framework . point estimates and corresponding 95 % credibility intervals were drawn from the posterior probability distribution . all statistical analyses were conducted in r version 3.5.2 ( r foundation for statistical computing , vienna , austria ) and the 'rstan ' package ( no-u-turn-sampler ( nuts ) ) ( see table 1 ) . \n\n result \n\n day date event 1 jan/20/2020 departed from the

across transmission types : 5.6 ( 95 % cri : 0.3 , 10.9 ) for passenger to passenger , 0.6 ( 95 % cri : 0.1 , 1.1 ) for passenger to crew , 0.5 ( 95 % cri : 0.2 , 0.8 ) for crew to passenger , 0.5 ( 95 % cri : 0.3 , 0.8 ) for crew to crew . although vaccines are still in early development stages as of february 2020 , based on our findings , the corresponding target vaccination coverage to contain the outbreak in this confined setting were estimated at 91 % and 94 % from the maximum value of the 50 percentile distribution and the 97.5 percentile distribution , respectively . \n\n range

of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 . passenger and crew also have total ( within-type and inter-type ) rt values largely below the epidemic threshold , with only small percentages at 0 % and 9 % above the epidemic threshold , respectively ( table 3 ) . \n\n discussion \n\n this is the first study to assess the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak that unfolded aboard the diamond princess ship , january-february 2020 . the overall mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore in the range 1.1-7 . however , following the implementation of the quarantine period , the overall rt decreased substantially compared to values estimated during the early stage , but it exhibited fluctuations around the epidemic threshold , which likely prolonged the outbreak . \n\n our results indicate that rt declined following the quarantine measures implemented by the japanese government on february 5 relative to values during the early phase of the outbreak . importantly , only those passengers and crew who tested positive for the novel coronavirus were permitted to disembark the diamond princess ship , with more than 80 percentage of the passengers and crews still on board as of february 18 , 2020 . our latest overall estimate of rt at 0.35 ( 95 % cri : 0.02 , 2.19 ) with only 2 % of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 suggested a low probability of observing a subsequent outbreak aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n our findings indicate that the passenger-to-passenger transmission type dominated the transmission dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . the rapid increase in the overall rt from day 12 ( january 31 , 2020 ) to day 19 ( february 7 , 2020 ) is greatly influenced by the increase in passenger-to-passenger transmission , and this time period covers the time lag between february 1 , 2020 when the index covid-19 case was reported and february 5 , 2020 when the japanese government requested the passengers to stay inside their cabin after the detection of a cluster of covid-19 positive cases . upon the implementation of the quarantine orders , the overall rt and rt for passengers aboard the diamond princess ship declined thereafter , while rt among crew maintained a steady level and only started to decline on day 25 of the outbreak ( february 13 , 2020 ) . this is consistent with the fact that passengers staying inside their cabins led to a substantial decline in passenger-to-passenger transmission type except for their interaction with cabin mates . indeed , the proportion of secondary infections inside the cabins increased from 7 % ( 1/15 ) on february 6 , 43 % ( 3/7 ) on february 10 , 2020 to 100 % ( 1/1 ) on february 14 , 2020 . thus , a high proportion of the symptomatic cases after the quarantine gradually shifted from largely passenger cases to crew cases . indeed , despite their potential risk of acquiring the infection , crews had to continue to work to deliver services to isolated passengers . the distribution of the median re by transmission type suggests that other transmission types likely contributed to this outbreak to some extent ( fig . 3 ) . because one quarantine officer , one nurse , and one administrative officer contracted covid-19 aboard the diamond princess ship , the infection risk continued to be significant inside the diamond princess ship . \n\n as for the crude asymptomatic ratios by age groups , they show significant differences across age groups . however , these crude ratios are severely influenced by the timing of specimen collection relative to the infection time . hence , these ratios could be better ascertained if additional data with the timing of specimen collection becomes available . \n\n several limitations should be listed . first , a total of 103 laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases with unknown onset dates were not incorporated in our analysis . although the high proportion of unavailable data ( 34 % ( 103/300 ) ) likely influenced a downward bias in estimates of transmission potential , our estimates still point to the high transmission potential of covid-19 inside confined settings . second , it is possible that reporting delays could have influenced our latest estimates of the effective reproduction number . in fact , the us government recently sent a chartered flight to transport the american passengers on board the diamond princess ship , and after the disembarkation process , a total of 14 american passengers tested positive for the disease on february 16 , 2020 . this event also contributes to a downward bias in r although the number of cases does not exceed the peak of the outbreak , further supporting the potent transmissibility of covid-19 in confined settings . \n\n our most recent estimate of the effective reproduction number of the ongoing covid-19 epidemic on board the diamond princess ship was largely below the epidemic threshold of 1.0 , which suggested a very low probability of observing secondary outbreaks of the disease in the diamond princess ship . \n\n funding statement \n\n km acknowledges support from the japan society for the promotion of science kakenhi grant number 18k17368 and from

00000100	asymptomatic and human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 in a 2-family cluster , xuzhou , china . \n\n we report epidemiologic , laboratory , and clinical findings for 7 patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease in a 2-family cluster . our study confirms asymptomatic and human-to-human transmission through close contacts in familial and hospital settings . these findings might also serve as a practical reference for clinical diagnosis and medical treatment . 
00001000	contact transmission of covid-19 in south korea : novel investigation techniques for tracing contacts \n\n in the epidemiological investigation of an infectious disease , investigating , classifying , tracking , and managing contacts by identifying the patient 's route are important for preventing further transmission of the disease . however , omissions and errors in previous activities can occur when the investigation is performed through only a proxy interview with the patient . to overcome these limitations , methods that can objectively verify the patient 's claims ( medical facility records , global positioning system , card transactions , and closed-circuit television ) were used for the recent ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 contact investigations in south korea . \n\n introduction \n\n an epidemiological investigation aims to quickly determine the prevalence of an infectious disease whilst simultaneously revealing the cause , and source of the disease , and explore the transmission process to ultimately prevent the spread of the infectious disease . as individuals become the source of the infectious disease , and if person-to-person transmission is suspected , it is important to immediately identify , and manage people that are in close contact with suspected patients . in particular , if there are several unknown epidemiological and clinical characteristics , and an effective medical intervention is lacking ( as in the case of new infectious diseases such as covid-19 ) , contact management becomes 1 of the core strategies to minimize additional transmission . for these strategies to be successful , it is necessary to evaluate between-person exposure risk in all locations where there have been confirmed cases ( after the onset of symptoms ) , and to classify contact persons based on this risk . furthermore , it is also important to eliminate the possibility of exposure to infection in the places visited by the confirmed patient , by performing the appropriate disinfection of areas that can harbor environmental contamination . however , traditional investigative methods , depending on the patient or proxy interview , has the limitation of omissions and errors of previous activities . \n\n the covid-19 outbreak in china occurred on december 8th , 2019 , and the first case in korea was reported on january 20th , 2020 . as of february 14th , the total number of confirmed cases of covid-19 in korea was 28 . in the current epidemiological investigation contact investigation techniques that were used on a limited basis for the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) outbreak in 2015 , are being used in all confirmed cases of covid-19 . \n\n this report will provide a general overview of the contact investigation from the covid-19 national emergency response center , epidemiology and case management team and describe the various methods used to evaluate exposure risk . \n\n results \n\n covid-19 contact investigation and management comprised of the following : 1 ) determination of the location of the contact ( patient route ) , 2 ) exposure risk evaluation , 3 ) contact classification , and 4 ) contact management . the location of the contact was determined through the process of preliminary identification , by interviewing patients , and their acquaintances , and by objective verification of the investigated information . exposure risk evaluation was performed depending on the route of disease transmission , patient characteristics , and environmental characteristics . based on the results of the evaluation , the contacts were classified into close and casual contacts depending on the exposure . the method of managing the classified contacts was largely distinguished between movement restriction and symptom monitoring . movement restriction is a legal public health order , and quarantine ( isolation ) , home isolation , or controlled travel is enacted . symptom monitoring was performed as either active or passive monitoring , depending on the exposure risk ( figure 1 ) . \n\n the methods used to overcome recall and confirmation biases that can occur while determining the location of the contact include checking medical facilities records , phone-based global positioning system ( gps ) , card transaction records , and closed-circuit television ( cctv ; table 1 ) . \n\n 1 . history of using medical facilities and visiting pharmacies \n\n history of using medical facilities , and visiting pharmacies was used to estimate the window of time of infection , through an accurate evaluation of the clinical symptoms of the infectious disease , and initial onset of the symptoms . if a medical facility was included in the patient 's route , quarantine of the medical facility was conducted . \n\n 2 . gps \n\n consistency in the recall of the route of the patients identified through interview was evaluated . additionally , identification of the routes that the patient could not remember was also possible . however , another person 's information can be misunderstood as the patient 's information if the phone is not owned by or carried by the patient . gps uses cellular phone networks , therefore there are limitations in identifying the exact locations of a patient 's route . \n\n 3. credit card transaction log \n\n credit card transaction logs were used to assess the consistency in the route of the patient identified through interview , and the scope of contacts was assessed by specifying the locations visited . however , if the patient did not use a credit card under their name or if another person used the patient 's card , the information may be misinterpreted . thus , rechecking the contents of the credit card log was necessary , and instances of not being able to use the information at the appropriate time may occur . \n\n 4 . cctv \n\n by checking the video footage of the location of a patient 's path , cctv provided help to identify the details of each situation . for example , cctv was used to evaluate the level of exposure risk by identifying whether the patient wore masks , or had respiratory symptoms such as a cough . the limitations of using cctv were the lengthy time required to check the cctv , and the accuracy of patient identification if the cctv was not inside the facility or the patient was in a blind spot of the camera . \n\n discussion \n\n based on the experience of the mers outbreak in 2015 , laws were revised to supplement the areas that were lacking at the time . korea centers for disease control and prevention were able to use relevant information in epidemiological investigations to contain and prevent infection , thus enabling the establishment of a more comprehensive management of infectious diseases . furthermore , making accurate information available to the general public helps to minimize fear and confusion with respect to the risk of transmissibility of the disease . the use of methods that have objectively verified the patient 's route claims ( medical facility records , gps , card transactions , and cctv ) for covid-19 contact investigations in south korea has provided accurate information on the location , and time of exposure , and details of the situation , thus reducing omissions in a patient 's route due to recall or confirmation bias that may have arisen from patient or proxy interviews . \n\n however , the publicization of a patient 's route for the public 's benefit infringes upon the privacy of the patient . thus , it is necessary to establish a protocol to protect privacy . equally , more effort should be taken to provide accurate information to the public . patient information that is unrelated to the communication of risk of infectious diseases must be protected by clearly defining the standards of publicization and reporting of patient information for the public 's benefit when an infectious disease is prevalent . \n\n with regards to responding to the recent prevalence of covid-19 , korea centers for disease control and prevention are performing defense activities to contain and prevent infection at the appropriate time , with more objective and accurate methods for monitoring patient contacts by using personal information . however , an evaluation of the effectiveness of these monitoring methods when multiple patients are involved , is necessary after the situation has been controlled . epidemiological investigations require the collaboration of various related persons and must be conducted through a strict verification process . furthermore , investigations must be performed using systematic processes with scientific methods and principles , and cycles of continuous evaluation and feedback to identify the etiology , extent , progression and therapy for the infectious disease and the development of public health policies . \n\n conflicts of interest \n\n the authors declare no competing

00001000	strategic planning to augment the testing capacity for covid-19 in india . \n\n background & objectives : nearly 5,500 tests for coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) had been conducted on march 31 , 2020 across the indian council of medical research ( icmr ) -approved public and private laboratories in india . given the need to rapidly increase testing coverage , we undertook an exercise to explore and quantify interventions to increase the daily real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qrt-pcr ) -based testing capacity over the next few months . the objective of this exercise was to prepare a potential plan to scale-up covid-19 testing in india in the public sector . methods : potential increase in daily testing capacity of the existing public laboratories was calculated across the three base scenarios of shifts ( 9 , 16 and 24 h ) . additional testing capacity was added for each shift scenario based on interventions ranging from procurement of additional qrt-pcr machines , leveraging spare capacity on available qrt-pcr machines not drafted into covid-19 testing , to in-laboratory process optimization efforts . results : moving to a 24 h working model in the existing approved laboratories can enhance the daily testing capacity to 40,464 tests/day . the capacity can be further bolstered by leveraging qrt-pcr and nucleic acid amplification test ( naat ) -based machines available with the multidisciplinary research units ( mrus ) , national aids control organisation ( naco ) and national tuberculosis elimination programme ( ntep ) . using combination/multiplex kits , and provision of automated rna extraction platforms at all laboratories could also optimize run time and contribute to capacity increase by 1.5-2 times . interpretation & conclusions : adopting these interventions could help increase public sector 's daily testing capacity to nearly 100,000-120,000 tests/day . it is important to note that utilization of the scaled-up testing capacity will require deployment of additional workforce , procurement of corresponding commodities for testing and scale-up of sample collection and transportation efforts . 
01100000	using integrated computational approaches to identify safe and rapid treatment for sars-cov-2 \n\n abstract \n\n sars-cov-2 is a new generation of coronavirus , which was first determined in wuhan , china , in december 2019 . so far , however , there no effective treatment has been found to stop this new generation of coronavirus but discovering of the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 main protease ( sars-cov-2 mpro ) may facilitate searching for new therapies for sars-cov-2 . the aim was to assess the effectiveness of available fda approved drugs which can construct a covalent bond with cys145 inside binding site sars-cov-2 main protease by using covalent docking screening . we conducted the covdock module mmgbsa module in the schrodinger suite 2020-1 , to examine the covalent bonding utilizing . besides , we submitted the top three drugs to molecular dynamics simulations via gromacs 2018.1 . the covalent docking showed that saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir and prevacid have the highest binding energies mmgbsa of -72.17 , -72.02 , -65.19 , -57.65 , -54.25 , -51.8 , and -51.14 kcal/mol , respectively . the 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation was conducted for saquinavir , ritonavir and remdesivir to evaluate the stability of these drugs inside the binding pocket of sars-cov-2 main protease . the current study provides a powerful in silico results , means for rapid screening of drugs as anti-protease medications and recommend that the above-mentioned drugs can be used in the treatment of sars-cov-2 in combined or sole therapy . \n\n communicated by ramaswamy h. sarma \n\n introduction \n\n sars-cov-2 also called 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ' abbreviated sars-cov-2 was recognized to be the causative of atypical pneumonia ( joshi , ; pant et al. , ) outbreak in wuhan , china ( hasan , ; s. a. khan et al. , 2020 ) . the virus belongs to the family known as 'coronaviruses ' because of the crown-like appearance of spikes glycoproteins on the envelope under an electron microscope ( y chen et al. , ) . world health organization ( who ) recently announced that the virus transforms from epidemic to pandemic , which requires urgent intervention to prevent the growing spread of the virus across the globe ( chan et al. , ) . the total confirmed cases 2,347,884 with 738,923 cases in the united state of america ( usa ) alone and the total death of 161,138 ( as of april 19 ) , with mortality estimated within 2 % and about 3.4 % , according to estimates of approved cases and death worldwide ( n. chen et al. , ) . the most familiar is a virus that arose from the rhinolophus bat which is > 96 % homologous with the modern sars-cov-2 virus and it is just 79 % homologous with the initial sars-cov ( fisher & heymann , ) . the fast-growing number of infected cases globally urged the world health organization to announce a state of global health emergency to correlate scientific and medical disciplines to develop rapidly an effective treatment for patients , ( morse et al. , ; sarma et al. , ) elderly patients and people with severe underlying health diseases like heart diseases , lung illness , and diabetic patients , for instance , appear to be at greater risk of revealing severe sars-cov-2 requires immediate intervention rather than waiting virus vaccine which may require 1 year to be available ( enayatkhani , ) . while drug repurposing could be a short-term and fast resolution to handle sars-cov-2 patients ( elfiky , ; r. j. khan et al. , 2020 ; kumar et al. , ) , repurposing existing drugs can offer a good choice to overcome the virus and offer better risk-versus trade-off as compared with discovering new drug and can help overcome time waiting for new therapy rather than use the available resources ( elmezayen , ; muralidharan , ) one successful repurposing drug story includes duloxetine which originally developed for depression and fda approved as the first-in-class choice for stress urinary incontinence ( sweeney & chancellor , ) , duloxetine initially created as antidepressant also is now passed to phase iii clinical trials as a first-in-class treatment for premature ejaculation ( mcmahon , ) and thalidomide , which had a tragic start as an over-the-counter sedative for morning sickness in pregnancy is now being applied to manage leprosy and multiple myeloma ( hideshima & anderson , ) . \n\n as a result of , a newly issued x-ray crystal of sars-cov-2 main protein ( mpro ) , we planning to use computational approaches ( cameron et al. , 2013 ) to contribute to find an effective treatment for sars-cov-2.thereby , computational analyses speed up these approaches since they allow to handle millions of data simultaneously ( gupta et al. , 2020 ) . molecular docking includes a set of computational methods and algorithms that aimed to identify novel relationships between chemical ligands and targets through using the modelling of their direct physical interaction ( aanouz , ; ekins et al. , ) . in present study , we attend to evaluate some of approved drugs to be as covalent binders , irreversible interactions , which can provide a powerful strategy to fight against epidemic viruses . and molecular dynamics simulations can give a more detail for the image which got from molecular covalent docking . \n\n materials and methods \n\n covalent virtual screening \n\n the crystal structure of fda-available covalent drugs which available in table 1 were selected based on the review of kumalo et al . and some of the antiviral drugs that can form a covalent bond to the target protein . and we aim also here to redirect them for other indications specially to see their possibility to fight against sars-cov-2 . thence , we searched about the chosen drugs in pubchem ( https : //pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) to identify the possibility of the selected drugs to be as covalent binders toward sars-cov-2 mpro . where , pubchem provides detailed information about the selected drugs rather than other repositories , especially , the property of drug to form covalent bond . before starting covalent docking , we downloaded the selected drugs one by one and optimize them by using the ligprep ( lim et al. , ) based on the opls_2005 force field and generated possible state employing epik in the schrodinger 2020 ( elfiky ; s. a. khan et al.,2020 ) . in the next step , the structure of sars-cov-2 mpro ( 6lu7 ) was downloaded from protein data bank ( http : //www.rcsb.org/pdb ) ( jin et al . , ) . the protease structure was optimized by adding hydrogens , removing water molecules and optimizing charge using the protein preparation wizard module ( kumalo et al. , ) in schrodinger suite 2020-1 . the covalent docking protocol was preferred since the cysteine 145 residue which is available in the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro considered as a vital residue that can form a covalent bond with the drug if it can interact covalently . the different mechanisms for the cys145-fda drug were mentioned in table 1 based on the nature of the drug so that the reactive functional group on the ligand and receptor residue are identified and the bond is formed between the correct atoms . these covalently docked complexes were created using covdock in schrodinger suite 2020-1 . finally , we selected the lowest the mmgbsa value for each drug as a propriate conformation of the drug inside the binding pocket . \n\n entry name pubchem id molecular

docking results showing type of based reaction for constructing covalent bond , docking score , glide score and rmsd . \n\n prime mm-gbsa \n\n the chosen drugs binding energies were calculated using prime mm-gbsa modules ( vijayakumar et al. , ) in the schrodinger ( 2020 ) . the best poses of selected drugs : sars-cov-2 mpro : were chosen to obtain the binding free energy calculation . prime mmgbsa is a method that combines optimized potential for liquid simulations-all atoms ( oplsaa ) force field , molecular mechanics energies ( emm ) , an sgb solvation model for polar solvation ( gsgb ) , and a non-polar solvation term ( gnp ) composed of the non-polar solvent accessible surface area and van der waals interactions . the total binding free energy : delta gbind = gcomplex - ( g-protein + gligand ) . \n\n molecular dynamics simulation \n\n molecular dynamics simulations are a decision-making process for inspections of protein-drug complexes ' stabilities ( al-khafaji & taskin tok , ) . it is used to clarify the dynamic behavior at an atomic level of biological systems , which is hard to handle in labs ( shukla et al. , ) . in the current study , we conducted molecular dynamics simulations for the top three drugs based on mmgbsa values . the got protein-drug complex structures from covalent docking were submitted to md simulations ( saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir with sars-cov-2 mpro ) . we hired gromacs 2018.1 to run 50 ns md simulations ( abraham et al. , ) . charmm 27 force field for all atoms were chosen to run md simulation ( bjelkmar et al. , ) . we used swiss param to produce the topologies of drugs ( zoete et al. , ) . all protein-drug systems were solvated with three-point transferable intermolecular potential ( tip3p ) and their charges were neutralized via adding na or cl ions . in the following step , the protein-drugs systems were energetically minimized through the steepest descent algorithm at a tolerance value of 1000 kj/mol.nm . then the equilibration with position restraint on the protein molecules for 0.1 ns using nvt and npt ensembles were done . electrostatic interactions were evaluated by particle mesh ewald summation ( darden et al. , ) . we performed the molecular dynamics simulation with no restraint on the protein molecules or ligand to determine the stability in the final step ( time step of 0.015 ns ) . rmsd , rmsf , rg , and number of hydrogen bonds were chosen to analyze md trajectories by using gromacs utilities . \n\n principal component analysis \n\n the principal component analysis ( pca ) approach was employed to calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues and their projection along with the first two principal components ( al-khafaji & taskin tok , ) . this approach is based on the protocol of gromacs 2018.1 ( abraham et al. , ) . it is used to simplify the effect of drugs on the dynamic motion of the targeted protein where it extracts the dynamic motions in simulations that are required for their biological function ( amadei et al. , ) . we got the principal component analysis from the md trajectories . a series of eigenvectors and eigenvalues were generated by diagonalizing the matrix . we chose trajectories of the protein backbone of the complexes to get 2 d-projection of motion of trajectory . \n\n results \n\n to assess the possibility of selected fda drugs to work as treatment of sars-cov-2 , the covalent docking was utilized to screen the selected library and rank them according to their binding affinities . the calculated binding free energies of some available drugs using docking score , glide gscore , and ensemble-average mm/gbsa are shown in table 1 . \n\n to validate our covalent docking results , the correlation between mmgbsa and docking score was constructed ( figure 1 ) . the binding energy mmgbsa-docking score correlation shows a good correlation ( r2 = 0.6299 ) . based on this correlation , we chose the top three ranked-mmgbsa and docking score values of fda drugs for dissection their binding modes inside the binding site . covalent docking showed that saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir , and prevacid have -72.17 , -72.02 , -65.19 , -57.65 , -54.25 , -51.8 , and -51.14 , respectively . where all the top-eight fda drugs show a higher affinity to form a covalent , irreversible bond with cys145 of sars-cov-2 mpro . here we investigated the role of molecular weight upon the affinity of selected drugs to bind covalently to cys145 , whereas 57 % of selected drugs which have molecular weight over than 600 g/mol ( figure 2 ) . and have higher free binding energy mmgbsa than -50 kcal/mol . while the ratio of selected drugs decreased to be 16 % of drugs which can form covalent bonding with over than -50 kcal/mol . surprisingly , none of the selected drugs which have a molecular weight below than 300 g/mol can form a good affinity of binding energy . this indicates that higher molecular weight covalent warheads can form stable and efficient binding energy . \n\n the correlation between mmgbsa binding energies and docking score . \n\n effect of molecular weight upon the mmgbsa binding energy . \n\n docked complex analyses \n\n what stands out in the table 1 is saquinavir has the highest binding affinity ( lowest binding energy mmgbsa of 72.17 kcal/mol ) . therefore , the deep examination of saquinavir is needed . figure 3 shows that saquinavir not only formed covalent bond of 1.81 a with cys145 but also formed five hydrogen bonds inside the pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro . in the second rank ritonavir as presented in table 1 has -72.02 kcal/mol . \n\n covalent docking analysis of saquinavir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n this high affinity resulted from covalent bond between ritonavir and cys145 of 1.82 a ( figure 4 ) through nucleophilic addition to double bond reaction besides it interacted within binding site by forming three hydrogen bonds . despite remdesivir formed covalent bond with cys145 of 1.82 a and three hydrogen bonds ( figure 5 ) and this is similar to ritonavir , but the mmgbsa value is lower than that of ritonavir this may due to nature of reaction which in remdesivir nucleophilic addition to triple bond . \n\n covalent docking analysis of ritonavir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n covalent docking analysis of remdesivir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n molecular dynamic simulation \n\n the effect of drug-protein interactions upon dynamics of biological system is a fundamental in drug discovery thereby we used rmsd to investigate the influence of saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir upon the stability of sars-cov-2 mpro . we utilized gromacs to execute the md simulations of 50 ns for three drug-protein systems besides of apo protein . rmsd fluctuations for both apo and hollo forms were measured and presented . the rmsd was calculated to assess the overall dynamics , stability , and convergence of the various systems and the results are presented in figure 6 ( a ) . \n\n analysis of rmsd , rmsf , rg and hydrogen bonding of saquinvir-sars-cov-2 mpro , ritonavir- sars-cov-2 mpro and remdesivir- sars-cov-2 mpro . ( a ) the protein 's backbone rmsd values with respect to time . ( b ) rmsf of the protein 's backbone with respect to position of residue in the protein . ( c ) rg of the protein backbone over the entire time of md simulation . ( d ) the number of hydrogen bonds through all the time of md simulation . \n\n figure 6 ( a ) shows there is a significant decrease in the rmsd value when sars-cov-2 main protease whether it bound to saquinavir , ritonavir , or remedisivir . further analysis revealed that the rmsd average of apo sars-cov-2 main protease was 0.294 nm but when it bound to saquinavir , ritonavir , and remedisivir the rmsd averages were.01865 , 0.2130 , and 0.2053 nm , respectively . another significant aspect of md simulation is the flexibility of protein 's backbone which can be assessed through measuring rmsf value . the results of the comparative analysis between these drugs and their effects upon sars-cov-2 main protease are illustrated in figure 6 ( b ) . closer scrutiny of figure 6 ( b ) exhibits the binding of saquinavir diminished the fluctuations of the protein 's backbone . and behavior is also can be seen from figure 6 ( b ) where the binding of both ritonavir and remedisivir led to reducing the flexibility of the protein . the radius of gyration ( rg ) is a definition of system 's density , and substantially influences the folding rate and stability of proteins . rg was employed to assess the compactness of all complexes . in this work , rg values are in agreement with rmsf values where there are no significant differences between apo form and hollo forms as presented in figure 6 ( c ) . this reveals that protein remained stable and compact all through the 50 ns time . the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds is a vital aspect to give an impression about the stability of drug and protein . also , the number of hydrogen bonds is relevant to the binding scores of molecular docking process . we calculated the hydrogen bonds over time to validate the stable interactions between top three drugs and their corresponding target . as seen in the figure 6 ( d ) the ritonavir has highest order of hydrogen bonding ( the average =3.35 ) , while saquinavir has an average of 1.68 . \n\n principle component analysis ( pca ) \n\n the essential dynamic method is a tool to explore the dynamical behavior in the space of sars-cov-2 main protease combined with saquinavir , ritonavir , and remedisivir . basically , the comparison of the drug-bound sars-cov-2 mpro and drug-unbound was made as reference . in order to further understand the configurational space , we selected the first two principal components ( pc1 , pc2 ) to analyze their projection of trajectories during the simulations of ligand free and ligand bound sars-cov-2 mpro of the phase space ( shown in figure 7 ) . during the four system simulations , the results clearly show that the unbound ligand protein covered a wider region of phase space , while all three drug-protein system occupied a smaller region of phase space . especially , saquinavir reduced the essential dynamics to lowest degree of functional motions as compared with another drugs . moreover , the pca results suggest that the drug-bound sars-cov-2 mpro is more stable than ligand-unbound sars-cov-2 mpro form of sars-cov-2 mpro . in short , the pca results are also in agreement with the rmsd and rmsf results , which enhance the validity of the performed analysis . \n\n two-dimensional projection of motion of trajectory of sars-cov-2 mpro bound with drugs over the pc1 and pc2 . \n\n discussion \n\n sars-cov-2 causes major pandemic health issue since its spread across the world and can infect humans mainly respiratory system causing severe pneumonia with no vaccine and drug treatment available . prior study that have referred to the significance of molecular docking to determine effective treatment in short time ( wu , et al. , ) . in reviewing the literature , we took the advantage of possibility of fda available drugs that can be as a covalent warhead to inhibit the sars-cov-2 mpro with cys145 . an initial objective of the project was to identify effective and applicable treatment . the present study focused on the main protease ( mpro ) , especially pdb id ( 6lu7 ) as a potential target for several marketed drugs as possible therapeutic option to combat the virus to see the capability of these drugs to bind with the cysteine 145 residue which is available in the binding site of sars-cov-2 main protease . the mpro in sars-cov-2 is necessary for the proteolytic maturation of the virus targeting this protein to limit the expansion of infection by hindering the cleavage of the viral polyprotein . the most interesting finding was that the both saquinavir and ritonavir have the same affinity ( binding energy mmgbsa -72 kcal/mol ) to block binding site of sars-cov-2 with irreversible interactions . this study supports evidence from previous observations that lopinavir/ritonavir can inhibit sars-cov-2 ( lim et al. , ) . another important outcome was that the remdesivir comes in second rank with binding affinity ( mmgbsa = -65 kcal/mol ) . whereas previous research has established that remdesivir can inhibit sars-cov-2 m proenzyme through docking results . another significant finding , delavirdine computationally showed the ability to form irreversible covalent bond of -57.65 kcal/mol mmgbsa binding energy . moreover , indinavir and cefuroxime axetil exhibited the possibility to halt the pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro by forming stable interaction through covalent bonding and hydrogen bonding ( mmgbsa binding energies -54 kcal/mol ) . furthermore , oseltamivir and prevacid exhibited same affinity to bind with sars-cov-2 protease through one covalent bond and one hydrogen bond ( -51 kcal/mol ) , which is a good explanation for the activity of oseltamivir ( peeri et al. , ) . in this study , results obtained show the binding affinity of drugs to an active site depends on several factors mainly the ability of a compound to form a covalent bond with amino acid residues of the mpro ( cys145 ) and length of a covalent bond , the number of h-bonds that can form with a pocket of the active site and type of nucleophilic addition of unsaturated bonds . in this concept , the structural features in saquinavir and ritonavir like free amine group ( -nh2 ) , hydroxyl groups ( -oh ) , carbonyl groups ( c=o ) in addition to ether group play key structural feature to form h-bond . results show the promising activities for antiretroviral drugs saquinavir that used for hiv/aids more than ritonavir and remdesivir followed by lopinavir as the best drugs to bind covalently toward sars-cov-2 mpro with lowest energy of binding . as discussed above , saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir , and prevacid showed the ability to block the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro by forming covalent bond and stabilized with hydrogen bonding . \n\n these outcomes are contrary to that of kandeel and al-nazawi ( 2020 ) , they found that ribavirin , telbivudine , vitamin b12 , and nicotinamide can be can form non-bonding interactions . whilst our results showed that , saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir can form irreversible interactions , which are considered an effective way for viral infections . \n\n in the present work , comparative molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir on the conformational and dynamical demeanor in either apo or hollo forms to understand the inhibitory possibility at atomic level . an initial mission of the project was to identify rapid , effective , safe , and available for large proportions of people , so we run covalent docking and mmgbsa to sift the possibility of these drug to form irreversible interactions . therefore , we had chosen these drugs because they carry covalent warheads that can bind covalently to the target . but the docking results are not adequate , so we run md simulations examine how much these drugs are able to form stable interactions with targeted protein . one interesting finding is the rmsd of protein backbone in apo status has higher average value , whereas the binding with top three drugs diminished these rmsd average . another important finding was that the rmsf of protein 's backbone be less flexible when it compared to apo form of sars-cov-2 main protease . it is somewhat surprising that the binding of three drugs have not noted in rg values . it is not yet clear whether the top three drugs can show an evidence to inhibit the targeted protein , thereby we lean on the principal component analysis to analyze the md trajectories to judge without dispute . the most obvious finding to emerge from 2d pca analysis is that the binding of under investigated drugs caused stately impact on essential dynamics of protein by reducing its essential dynamics to its least possible motions . these results seem to be consistent with rmsd results . a possible explanation for this might be that binding of the drugs make the binding site much narrower due to hydrogen bindings this makes the 3d structure of targeted protein more rigid so it will lose its biological functions . it is possible , therefore , that using these available drugs in two ways : either alone or in combined way . these findings suggest the possible use of nominated drugs against sars-cov-2 in short time as approved by covalent docking screening . also , the present results are significant in at least directing the clinicians to use these safe drugs to stop development of corona virus and second giving hope that available drugs that can be efficient treatment . \n\n conclusions \n\n coronavirus today emphasizes as a potential threat to all people worldwide . although extensive researches have been directed to stop sars-cov-2 , but till now there is no medication . meanwhile , the spreading with complicated crisis requires immediate therapy to overcome the spread and minimize mortality of sars-cov-2 . the aim of the present study was to discover effective treatment through repurposing some of available fda-approved drugs against sars-cov-2 mpro . where , they can provide covalent warheads in virtual screening . the most prominent finding to emerge from this study is that the affinity of covalent binder toward sars-cov-2 mpro is ranked : saquinavir > ritonavir > remdesivir > delavirdine > cefuroxime axetil > oseltamivir = prevacid . one of the more noteworthy findings in this study is that md simulation analysis that saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir can form stable interaction inside the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro . also , they restricted the essential motions of protein . overall , the results of screening toward mpret encourage for further clinical evaluations . they can be easy to reach and exploit as persuasive treatments for sars-cov-2 . \n\n acknowledgements \n\n authors thankful for staff membered of gaziantep university institute of health sciences , department of bioinformatics and computational biology . \n\n

00001000	strength , weakness , opportunity , threat ( swot ) analysis of the adaptations to anatomical education in the united kingdom and republic of ireland in response to the coivd-19 pandemic . \n\n the covid-19 pandemic has driven the fastest changes to higher education across the globe , necessitated by social distancing measures preventing any face to face teaching . this has led to an almost immediate switch to distance learning by higher education institutions . anatomy faces some unique challenges . intrinsically , anatomy is a three-dimensional subject that requires a sound understanding of the relationships between structures , often achieved by the study of human cadaveric material , models and virtual resources . this study sought to identify the approaches taken in the united kingdom and republic of ireland to deliver anatomical education through online means . data were collected from 14 different universities in the united kingdom and republic of ireland and compared adopting a thematic analysis approach . once themes were generated , they were collectively brought together using a strength , weakness , opportunity , threat ( swot ) analysis . key themes included the opportunity to develop new online resources and the chance to engage in new academic collaborations . academics frequently mentioned the challenge that time constrains could place on the quality and effectiveness of these resources ; especially as in many cases the aim of these resources is to compensate for a lack of exposure to cadaveric exposure . comparisons of the actions taken by multiple higher education institutions reveals the ways that academics have tried to balance this demand . discussions will facilitate decisions being made by higher education institutions regarding adapting the curriculum and assessment methods in anatomy . 
10001000	early trends for sars-cov-2 infection in central and north texas and impact on other circulating respiratory viruses . \n\n introduction : rapid diagnosis and isolation are key to containing the quick spread of a pandemic agent like sars-cov-2 , which has spread globally since its initial outbreak in wuhan province in china . sars-cov-2 is novel and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal viruses is just becoming apparent . we present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of march , 2020 . methods : this is a retrospective cohort study post launching of sars-cov-2 testing at baylor scott and white hospital ( bswh ) , temple , texas . testing for sars-cov-2 was performed by real-time rt-pcr assay and results were shared with state public health officials for immediate interventions . results : more than 3500 tests were performed during the first two weeks of testing for sars-cov-2 and identified 168 ( 4.7 % ) positive patients . sixty-two ( 3.2 % ) of the 1,912 ambulatory patients and 106 ( 6.3 % ) of the 1,659 ed/inpatients tested were positive . the highest rate of infection ( 6.9 % ) was seen in patients aged 25-34 years , while the lowest rate of infection was seen among patients aged < 25 years old ( 2 % ) . county-specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions . incidentally , this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of seasonal respiratory virus infections , perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness about sars-cov-2 among the general public , as well as the social distancing measures implemented in response to sars-cov-2 . data extracted for bswh from the cdc 's national respiratory and enteric virus surveillance system ( nrevss ) site revealed that influenza incidence was 8.7 % in march 2020 , compared to 25 % in march 2019 . conclusions : this study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management . this study provided sars-cov-2 testing data from ambulatory and inpatient population . epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like sars-cov-2 . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved . 
01000000	reverse vaccinology approach to design a novel multi-epitope vaccine candidate against covid-19 : an in silico study \n\n abstract \n\n at present , novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov , the causative agent of covid-19 ) has caused worldwide social and economic disruption . the disturbing statistics of this infection promoted us to develop an effective vaccine candidate against the covid-19 . in this study , bioinformatics approaches were employed to design and introduce a novel multi-epitope vaccine against 2019-ncov that can potentially trigger both cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell immune responses and investigated its biological activities by computational tools . three known antigenic proteins ( nucleocapsid , orf3a , and membrane protein , hereafter called nom ) from the virus were selected and analyzed for prediction of the potential immunogenic b and t-cell epitopes and then validated using bioinformatics tools . based on in silico analysis , we have constructed a multi-epitope vaccine candidate ( nom ) with five rich-epitopes domain including highly scored t and b-cell epitopes . after predicting and evaluating of the third structure of the protein candidate , the best 3 d predicted model was applied for docking studies with toll-like receptor 4 ( tlr4 ) and hla-a * 11:01 . in the next step , molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation was used to evaluate the stability of the designed fusion protein with tlr4 and hla-a * 11:01 receptors . md studies demonstrated that the nom-tlr4 and nom-hla-a * 11:01 docked models were stable during simulation time . in silico evaluation showed that the designed chimeric protein could simultaneously elicit humoral and cell-mediated immune responses . \n\n communicated by ramaswamy h. sarma \n\n introduction \n\n coronavirus disease covid-19 outbreak began in late december 2019 in wuhan , the capital of hubei province , china ( wang et al. , ) . scientists from all over the world are attempting to investigate this novel virus , known as 2019-ncov , which is highly contagious , and to discover effective interventions to control and prevent the disease ( heymann , ; huang et al. , ) . coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses ( ssrna+ ) belonging to the coronaviridae family . human coronaviruses hcov-229e , hcov-nl63 , hcov-oc43 , and hcov-hku1 are observed in almost one-third of the common cold ( lim et al. , ) . however , recently some cases of human coronavirus infections have led to fatal endemics , including sars ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) , mers ( middle east respiratory syndrome ) and covid-19 that are common diseases between humans and animals whose belong to the genus betacoronavirus of the coronaviridae family ( al-tawfiq et al. , ) . so far , the novel covid-19 has caused more than 700,000 illnesses and more than 33,000 deaths worldwide ( w.h.o. , 2020 ) . the genome size of this virus is about 30 kb and encodes structural and non-structural proteins like other coronaviruses . structural proteins include s protein ( spike ) , e protein ( envelope ) , m protein ( membrane ) , and n protein ( nucleocapsid ) ( ahmed et al. , ) . the increasing rate of covid-19 disease and the high morbidity necessitate the development of a specific and safe vaccine candidate as soon as possible . there is very little known actually about the pathogenesis of the virus ; therefore , an immunoinformatics-based approach to investigate the immunogenic epitopes and vaccine design using data from proteins sequencing of the covid-19 is required . \n\n n protein is the only structural protein that associates with replicase-transcriptase complexes and binds with genomic rna in coronaviruses ( cong et al. , ) . this protein is multifunctional and one of the most crucial structural components of coronaviruses . n protein is a structural and antigenic protein that is involved in packaging , transcription , and replication coronaviruses ( 4 ) . this data showed that n protein is a suitable candidate for targeting drug and vaccine design because this protein is conserved , antigenic and multifunctional ( 6 ) . leung and et al . concluded that n protein can be a suitable vaccine candidate against sars-cov because induce strong antibody and this process may trigger cytokine production ( leung et al. , ) . coronaviruses m protein also has a key role in the assembly of virions . the sars-cov m protein can interact with n protein and make a network of interactions with the genomic rna ( he et al. , ) . ong and et al . the covid-19 antigens such as s , n and m proteins introduced as a vaccine candidate ( 6 ) . this protein has also been studied as an epitope vaccine candidate against sars-cov ( 7 ) . \n\n open reading frame 3a ( orf3a ) is required for viral replication and virulence of sars cov . severe induction of proinflammatory cytokine is a sign of sars-cov and mers-cov infections . orf3a activates both pro-il-1beta gene expression and il-1beta secretion and leads to severe lung injury . ( siu et al. , ) . also , orf3a has an important role in sars-cov assembly or budding with the participation of m and e proteins ( mcbride & fielding , ) . these proteins are not only involved in the pathogenesis of the covid-19 virus but also have high antigenicity ( chan et al. , ; siu et al. , ; xu et al. , ) . in this study e , m , n , orf10 , orf8 , orf3a and m proteins were evaluated by available bioinformatics tools for designing an efficient multi-epitope vaccine for the stimulation of immune responses against covid-19 infection . \n\n since the covid-19 has been recently discovered , little immunological information is available . preliminary studies based on phylogenetic analyses of the covid-19 whole genome have suggested that this virus is very similar to the sars-cov ( 79.7 % identify ) ( 9 , 14 ) . given the apparent similarity between the two viruses , it could be concluded that previous studies on the protective immune responses against sars-cov may be useful for developing a vaccine for covid-19 . previous studies have suggested that both humoral and cellular immunity play important roles in protective responses against this virus ( deming et al. , ; yang et al. , ) . studies revealed that the formation of antibodies against the n protein of sars-cov , an immunogenic protein that is highly expressed during infection , is relatively common in patients infected with this virus ( liu et al. , ; lin et al. , ) . although these antibodies are effective , they have a shorter lifespan in recovering the patients . in addition to the specific humoral immunity , it has been shown that the cd4+ and cd8+ responses provide long-lasting protection against covid-19 . these studies showed that besides antibody-mediated immune response , cellular immunity is critical to induce protectivity in these infections ( liu et al. , ) . the concept of a multi-epitope vaccine is to efficiently identify and assemble b and t-cell epitopes that are more capable of stimulating the immune system and therefore can induce more potent and effective both arms of immune responses . peptides and epitopes have shown to be desirable candidates for vaccine development due to their relatively easy production , chemical stability , and lack of infectious potential ( patronov & doytchinova , ) . the experimental design and production of multi-epitope vaccines have improved dramatically in recent years . these vaccines are mainly made up of b-cell , cd8+ cytolytic t-cell ( ctls ) and cd4+ helper t-cells ( htls ) epitopes ( chiarella et al. , ) . since the antigenic epitopes of a protein could be predicted and detected , therefore the whole protein is not suitable to stimulate an immune response ( testa & philip , ; zheng et al. , ) . during the development of a vaccine candidate against covid-19 , complex pathogenic mechanisms and numerous pathogenic factors should be considered in vaccine formulation . \n\n in the present study , we aimed to design a novel multi-epitope fusion protein ( nucleocapsid , orf3a , and membrane protein or nom ) containing more efficient antigenic epitopes-rich domains . the biological activity of the engineered fusion protein was assessed by bioinformatics tools using the interaction between the vaccine candidate and the innate immune system receptor ( tlr4 ) and cellular immune system receptor ( hla-a * 11:01 ) . we strongly believe that the outcome of the present report will provide a potential vaccine candidate against 2019-ncov . \n\n materials and methods \n\n in this study , we designed a suitable vaccine candidate against covid-19 , by exploiting the programs of reverse vaccinology ( figure 1 ) \n\n strategies employed in the overall study . \n\n retrieval of protein sequences \n\n at first , the amino acid sequences of proteins were retrieved from the national centre for biotechnology information ( ncbi ) at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov in fasta format and performed for subsequent analysis ( table 1 ) . \n\n name protein accession number fasta nucleocapsid protein qic53221.1 > qic53221.1 nucleocapsid protein [ severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ] [ severe acute

selected six proteins of covid-19 virus ( table 1 ) that have an essential role in virulence and replication of the virus , and previous studies have highlighted the necessity of these proteins in coronaviruses function . after the antigenic analysis of these proteins , three proteins of n , orf3a , and m were selected for final analysis . \n\n prediction of t-cell ( hla class i and ii ) epitopes \n\n 1d sequence-based screening server rankpep was used to identify t-cell epitopes ( reche & reinherz , ) . this server predicts peptide binders to mhc molecules from protein sequences using the position-specific scoring matrix ( pssm ) . we have selected all hla class i alleles from the selection panel of rankpep server for prediction of epitopes of hla class i . to prediction of epitopes of hla class ii , we considered drb1 * 0101 , drb1 * 0301 , drb1 * 0401 , drb1 * 0701 , drb1 * 0801 , drb1 * 1101 , drb1 * 1301 , and drb1 * 1501 that cover hla variability of over 95 % of the human population worldwide ( kruiswijk et al. , ) . \n\n b-cell epitopes ( linear ) identification \n\n for the prediction of b-cell epitopes , the amino acid sequence was analyzed using bepipred and kolaskar & tongaonkar antigenicity ( http : //www.iedb.org/ ) servers ( vita et al. , ) . bepipred for linear epitope prediction uses both hidden markov model and amino acid propensity scales methods . kolaskar and tongaonkar evaluate the protein for b cell epitopes using the physicochemical properties of the amino acids and their frequencies of occurrence in recognized b cell epitopes ( kolaskar & tongaonkar , ; mirza et al. , ) . \n\n selection of epitope-rich domains and the final sequence \n\n according to the prediction results of the servers used , b cell epitopes and hla class i and ii epitopes that have had high scores were extracted and combined to generate multi-epitope protein . b cell and t cell epitope-rich domains of n , orf3a and m proteins were selected and joined to each other with an aaa linker . \n\n antigenicity and allergenicity evaluation \n\n antigenicity of designed recombinant protein predicted using the vaxijen v2.0 server . the vaxijen classified antigens based on auto cross-covariance ( acc ) transformation of protein sequences into uniform vectors of principal amino acid properties which is a novel alignment-independent method and overcome the limitations of alignment-dependent sequence methods ( doytchinova & flower , ) . the prediction of vaccine candidate allergenicity is essential . the allergenicity of the designed protein was computed by allertop ( http : //www.ddg-pharmfac.net/allertop/ ) . allertop method predicts recombinant protein allergenicity on auto cross-covariance acc that describe residue hydrophobicity , size , abundance , helix- and beta-strand forming propensities ( dimitrov et al. , ) . allertop v.2 has the highest accuracy ( 88.7 % ) compared to several servers for allergen prediction ( dimitrov et al. , ) . \n\n the physicochemical parameters \n\n the analyzed parameters consisted of the molecular weight , theoretical pi , amino acid composition , atomic composition , extinction coefficient , estimated half-life , instability index , aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathicity that were evaluated by protparam online server ( http : //us.expasy.org/tools/ protparam.html ) ( gasteiger et al. , ) . \n\n secondary and tertiary structure prediction \n\n gor was used for the designed protein secondary structure prediction ( https : //npsa-prabi.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat.pl ? page=/npsa/npsa_gor4.html ) ( kloczkowski et al. , ) . gor4 predict protein secondary structure using information theory . \n\n the tertiary structure was built using the galaxy web . galaxyweb server ( http : //galaxy.seoklab.org/ tbm ) is based on the tbm method . this server detects similar proteins and alignment with the target sequence , then make the model and finally perform model refinement ( shin et al. , ) . \n\n tertiary structure refinement and validation \n\n the best-modeled structure was refined using the galaxy refine server at ( http : //galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi ? type=refine ) . galaxy refined the model by molecular dynamics simulation . this method showed one of the best performances in improving protein structure quality . \n\n analysis of the final 3 d model was made using molprobity , prosa and ramachandran plot . ramachandran plot obtained from rampage calculates torsional angles residue-by-residue in protein and indicates that residues are in allowed , favored or outlier regions ( oberholser , ) . prosa web used to recognize the errors in the generated 3 d models using atomic coordinates of the model . prosa web was created z-score ( overall model quality ) and a plot of residue energies of proteins ( wiederstein & sippl , ) . clash analysis is very important for the validation of proteins . molprobity is a structure-validation web service that calculates the clash score , protein-geometry score , poor rotamers , ramachandran plot , and molprobity score . \n\n defining discontinuous b-cell epitopes of designed protein \n\n the interaction between antigen epitopes and antibodies is very essential to eliminate the infection . conformational epitopes are the most important and the most prevalent epitopes that are recognized by antibodies . all conformational epitope prediction methods require the 3 d structures of proteins . discontinuous epitopes of recombinant protein predicted using the ellipro server . this web-based predicts discontinuous epitopes based on protein-antibody interactions . ellipro server predicts conformational and linear b cell epitopes using thornton 's method and by modeller program or blast search of pdb predict and visualize of antibody epitopes ( ponomarenko et al. , ) . \n\n obtaining and preparing the structures of immune receptors and nom recombinant protein \n\n the crystallographic structures of tlr4 ( pdb id : 2z62 ( kim et al. , ) ) and hla-a * 11:01 ( pdb id : 5wjl ( culshaw et al. , 2017 ) ) were obtained from the pdb database ( berman et al. , ) . the structures were cleaned and crystallographic waters and co-crystallized molecules were deleted and only the monomer forms of each receptor were kept . then , the structures of the two receptors and the nom protein were prepared by the dock prep tool in ucsf chimera software ( pettersen et al. , ) where hydrogen atoms and charge were added to the structures to make them ready for the next step . in the next step , to stabilize and relax the structures in an aqueous physiological environment , each of the monomer form of the receptors and the nom protein were simulated for 100 ns . the details of the md simulation will be explained later . \n\n protein-protein molecular docking and refinement \n\n after the md simulation of each receptor and the nom recombinant protein , the last frame of the trajectory of each simulation was extracted and used as the input structures for protein-protein molecular docking . the patchdock webserver ( schneidman-duhovny et al. , ) with default parameters was used to predict the best positions and orientations where the two proteins can have the highest number of favorable interactions . afterward , the top 10 solutions were subjected to firedock webserver ( andrusier et al. , ; mashiach et al. , ) to refine the interaction of protein-protein complexes resulted from molecular docking . the top two complexes from coronavirus nom protein-tlr4 and nom recombinant protein-hla-a * 11:01 complexes were chosen based on global energies . these four complexes were then taken to the next step , md simulation . \n\n molecular dynamics simulation \n\n after performing the protein-protein molecular docking and finding the best orientations of the vaccine candidate and the receptor proteins to interact with one another , the two best-scored complexes were subjected to md simulation . all of the md simulations were done by gromacs 2018 package ( abraham et al. , ) and opls-aa force field ( jorgensen et al. , ) . the monomer form of each protein and also the docked complexes were placed in the center of a triclinic box with a distance of 1 nm from all edges and solvated with tip3p water model ( jorgensen et al. , ) . then , sodium and chloride ions were added to produce a neutral physiological salt concentration of 150 mm . each system was energy minimized , using the steepest descent algorithm , until the fmax was found to be smaller than 10 kj.mol-1nm-1 . all of the covalent bonds were constrained using the linear constraint solver ( lincs ) algorithm ( hess et al. , ) to maintain constant bond lengths . the long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh ewald ( pme ) method ( darden et al. , ; essmann et al. , ) and the cut off radii for coulomb and van der waals short-range interactions were set to 0.9 nm . then 100 ps nvt ( constant number of particles ( n ) , volume ( v ) , and temperature ( t ) ) and 300 ps npt ( constant number of particles ( n ) , pressure ( p ) , and temperature ( t ) ) equilibrations were performed for each system . after the necessary equilibrations , 100 ns of production run were performed for each of the four complexes . finally , simulations were carried out under the periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , set at xyz coordinates to ensure that the atoms had stayed inside the simulation box , and the subsequent analyses were then performed using gromacs utilities , vmd ( humphrey et al. , ) and uscf chimera , and also the plots and the figures were created using daniel 's xl toolbox ( v 7.3.2 ) add-in ( kraus , ) and ezmol ( reynolds et al. , ) . all of the computations were performed on an ubuntu desktop pc , with a [ intel ( r ) xeon ( r ) cpu e5-2630 v3 + nvidia geforce gtx 1080 ] configuration . \n\n mmpbsa binding free energy \n\n the binding free energies of the protein-protein complexes were calculated by molecular mechanics-poisson-boltzmann solvent-accessible surface area , mmpbsa method ( kollman et al. , ) using g_mmpbsa package ( kumari et al. , ) . in this method , the binding free energy is the result of the free energy of the complex minus the sum of the free energies of the ligand and the protein . in our case , the nom recombinant protein is defined as the ligand and the immune receptors are defined as the receptors . the mmpbsa calculation was done for every ns of each simulation trajectories . \n\n results and discussion \n\n defining t-cell epitopes \n\n the results of several studies have shown that strong virus-specific t-cell response is required for the elimination of respiratory virus infections such as sars-cov and influenza a and para-influenza . these studies conclude that future vaccine interventions should also consider strategies to enhance t cell response to provide robust long-term memory ( channappanavar et al. , ; janice oh et al. , ) . studies have shown that high levels of t cell responses against n protein were found 2 years after the patient 's recovery ( peng et al. , ) . antibodies are essential to combat sars-cov infection , and the body needs sars-cov specific cd4+ t helper cells to produce these specific antibodies . also , cd8+ cytotoxic t cells are important for recognizing and killing infected cells , especially in the lungs of infected individuals . we used the rankpep server which covers almost all hla supertypes to predicted different epitops from n , orf3a and m proteins sequence according to hla i and hla ii alleles . antigenic epitopes with high binding affinity score were predicted that are summarized in table 2a-b . \n\n antigen hla_a0201 hla_a0204 hla_a0206 hla_b0702 hla_b51 hla_b5401 hla_b5301 nucleocapsid protein 316-324 299-307 66-74 343-351 66-74 45-53 gmsrigmev

such as measles and rubella reflects the importance of protective antibodies . protection against virus infection such as coronaviruses depends on the simulation of neutralizing antibodies in addition to the t cell-mediated immunity . while cytotoxic lymphocytes can kill infected cells , antibodies have the potential to eliminate infected cells and prevent the infectious virus from infecting a cell ( neutralization ) . sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies block viral entry ( dorner & radbruch , ; hsueh et al. , ) . in this study , for the linear epitope prediction , the bepipred server was employed . bepipred analysis revealed several continuous predicted epitopes of n , orf3a and m proteins . for cross-checking the predicted epitopes , the sequence of all three proteins was also predicted by kolaskar & tongaonkar antigenicity . the linear b-cell epitopes are represented in ( table 3 ) . given that both cellular and humoral immune responses are essential against coronaviruses infection ( janice oh et al. , ) , finally , epitopes that were shared between b cell and t-cell were selected . \n\n selected targets for designing the final vaccine \n\n the main strategy in the present study was to design and construct a novel multi-epitope protein from covid-19 based on in silico methods to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses . due to the low immunogenicity of the epitope , we chose epitope-rich domains to generate a more diverse and robust response ( wieser et al. , ) . based on in silico analysis , five epitope-rich domains including highly scored and shared epitopes between t and b-cell epitopes were selected and joined to each other with a three aaa linker ( table 4 ) . the schematic diagram of designed vaccine domains with linker 's sites has been shown in figure 2 . \n\n the schematic diagram of the vaccine candidate construct consists of n , orf3a and m proteins epitopes of the covid-19 linked together with aaa linkers . \n\n antigen server

allergenicity \n\n prediction of the vaccine candidate antigenicity represents a numerical criterion for the capability of the vaccine to bind to the b- and t-cell receptors and increase the immune response in the host cell . vaxijen v2.0 was used to predict the antigenicity of the designed protein . vaxijen analysis of nom protein showed potent antigenicity 0.5999 with a 0.4 % threshold . the results indicate that the designed protein sequences without adjuvant are antigenic . \n\n allergen proteins induce an ige antibody response ( dimitrov et al. , ) . the designed vaccine candidate must not show an allergic reaction to the body . the allergenicity of the sequence was predicted using the allertop tool . based on prediction approaches in allertop , this protein was not recognized as an allergen . \n\n the physicochemical parameters and protein secondary structure prediction \n\n primary structure analysis nom designed protein ( 337 aa ) has a molecular weight of 37513.57 d. the total number of positively charged residues ( arg + lys ) and negatively charged residues ( asp + glu ) were 19 and 32 respectively . the theoretical isoelectric point ( pi ) was calculated at 9.62 . the instability index ( < 40 ) indicates that the designed protein has high stability for the initiation of an immunogenic reaction . the instability index ( ii ) was 35.75 which classifies the protein as stable . the aliphatic index of nom recombinant protein was calculated 97.92 and indicates this protein has stability in several temperatures . \n\n natively unfolded protein regions and alpha-helix are important forms of structural antigens that can be arranged in their native structure and thus identified by antibodies that are produced in response to infection . ( shey et al. , ) . the composition of the predicted secondary structure of the nom multi-epitope vaccine candidate was 43.92 % ( alpha helix ) , 16.02 % ( extended strand ) , and 40.06 % ( random coil ) . all this information indicates the designed protein is suitable as a vaccine candidate . \n\n tertiary structure prediction and validation \n\n three-dimensional structure was modeled by galaxyweb for our designed protein ( figure 3a ) . this model was used for evaluation and refinement . for validation of the model , prosa-web , ramachandran plot and molprobity were used that compare and analyze the protein structure . the prosa web determined z-score for the best predicted 3 d model ( figure 3b ) . the z-score of the nom predicted model was -4.42 , which is within the range of scores typically found for native proteins of similar size . the ramachandran plot indicates that most of the residues are found in the favored and allowed regions ( 99.7 % ) and only 0.3 % in the outlier region , this shows that the quality of the designed model is satisfactory . phe 282 , asn311 , tyr228 , lys194 , asp223 , ser229 , ser4 , his197 , tyr68 residues were observed in the allowed and outlier regions of ramachandran plot ( figure 3c ) . in molprobity analysis , the all-atom clash score was 9.37 , the molprobity score was 2.21 . all structural images were created using pymol ( the pymol molecular graphics system , version 1.1 , schrodinger , llc ) . \n\n ( a-c ) prediction and validation of tertiary structure of the nom recombinant protein using ( a ) prediction of the

b-cell epitopes from the 3 d structure of nom recombinant protein . discontinuous b-cell epitopes were predicted with scores ranging from0.679 to 0.945 . amino acid residues , the number of residues , sequence location as well as their scores have been listed in tables 5 . the graphical representation of the discontinuous epitopes has been displayed in figure 4 . \n\n three-dimensional

conformational b-cell epitopes from vaccine protein using ellipro server . \n\n establishing the stability of the initial structures \n\n a vaccine can interact with different receptors of the immune system . we have docked designed final constructs ( nom ) with tlr4 and hla-a * 11:01 receptors . the interaction between these receptors and nom recombinant protein induce different immune responses . to achieve a stable and relaxed state of the nom recombinant protein and the immune receptors , a md simulation of 100 ns was performed for each structure . these simulations ensure that the structures are stable enough to be used for protein-protein molecular docking . after 100 ns of the production run , as it is shown in figure 5 , the rmsd ( root mean square distance ) values of the monomers show that the backbone structure of tlr4 ( pdb id : 2z62 ) is very rigid and stable . the structure of the nom recombinant protein also reached stability after about 25 ns after a considerable structural change . the backbone structure of the hla-a * 11:01 ( pdb id : 5wjl ) , however , showed big spikes in the rmsd values but all three structures were visually inspected and were considered stable enough for the next step of the project . \n\n the rmsd values of the simulated monomer forms of the proteins throughput the 100 ns of production runs . \n\n protein-protein molecular docking \n\n to find the best orientation for optimal interaction of the nom protein with the immune receptors we decided to use protein-protein molecular docking . we used patchdock webserver which concentrates on recognizing and matching patterns of the surfaces of the proteins to put them in the best possible positions . afterward , the top 10 best solutions were subjected to the firedock webserver to refine the docked structures . the firedock algorithms refine the docked complexes by side-chain rearrangement and soft rigid-body optimization . the ranking of the docked complexes is based on short-range , long-range , attractive and repulsive interaction energies between the residues of the two proteins , which are all summed up in the global energy or the binding energy of the complexes . we considered global energy as the main criterion for choosing the best complexes and chose the two top-scored solutions with the best global energy . as it is shown in table 6 , the solution numbers 5 and 6 from the nom-tlr4 complex and the solution numbers 2 and 3 , from nom-hla-a * 11:01 complex , were chosen for further calculations . the total energy plots of the simulations are shown in figure 6 . the results showed a strong interaction between designed protein amino acids and receptors . the interactions between the binding receptors and the docked nom protein were visualized using the ucsf chimera program . residues of hla-a * 1101 ( glu53 , asn174 , gly56 , asn174 , glu53 , pro57 ) participated in the interaction with arg49 , ser97 , gln91 , met102 , arg49 and gln91 residues of the candidate vaccine . also , nine residues of tlr4 ( tlr4 lys123 , ile319 , thr66 , ser90 , lys124 , lys46 , his85 , lys123 ) participated in the interaction with ser45 , glu199 , gln91 , ala84 , met328 , gln65 , ser90 , glu68 residues of the designed candidate vaccine . \n\n the total energy plots of the simulations . \n\n complex no of solution glob

simulation of top scored solutions \n\n after the protein-protein molecular docking , 4 solutions were chosen for md simulation , solution numbers 2 and 3 from nom protein-hla-a * 11:01 complex and solution numbers 5 and 6 from nom protein-tlr4 complex . each was simulated for 100 ns . to examine their stability throughout the simulations period , the rmsd values of each protein was analyzed . as it is shown in figure 7 , each protein has different rmsd values and in some of them , the backbone atoms have considerable movements during the simulations . the reason is that the interactions can get optimized and rearranged by introducing water molecules and physiological conditions . the rmsd values of tlr4 in nom protein-tlr4 complexes and the values of hla-a * 11:01 in nom protein-hla-a * 11:01 complexes are very stable and the average values do not reach very high values . however , the rmsd values of the nom protein in every complex reach high values which means that the structure of the vaccine has more movements to refine the interactions with the immune receptors . however , the interactions between the nom recombinant protein and the immune receptors are quite strong and mmpbsa binding energy calculations exhibit great binding energies . as it is shown in table 7 , the van der waals and electrostatic energies of the complexes are strong enough to keep the two proteins in contact with each other . moreover , the deviation of each value is very small which means that the interactions are very stable and consistent throughout the simulations . in another word , the higher scale of rmsd values with consistent binding energies only show that the structure of the nom protein is well optimized for interacting with the immune receptors . \n\n the rmsd

cfvlaavyrinwitggiaiamaclvglmwlsyfiasf \n\n five epitope-rich domains were selected \n\n in addition to the analysis described above , to analyze the fluctuations of the backbone atoms of structures of the proteins , we decided to perform rmsf ( root mean square fluctuation ) analysis . in this analysis , the average value of fluctuation of each residue during the simulation is plotted , figure 8 . as it is shown in figure 8a , the rmsf values of nom recombinant protein in five simulations indicate that the fluctuation of the monomer form of the vaccine in many regions is considerably more than the complex forms . this is a direct indication that the nom recombinant protein is much more stable when it is in complex with the two immune receptors . furthermore , the rmsf values of the nom recombinant protein in complex with hla-a * 11:01 are lower compared with that of nom recombinant protein in complex with tlr4 . also , with the evidence that the binding energies are also lower , we can conclude that nom recombinant protein can bind to the hla-a * 11:01 better than the other immune receptor . \n\n the rmsf values of each protein in the simulated complexes compared to the simulated monomer forms of the proteins throughout the 100 ns of production runs . a , the comparison of the rmsf values of nom recombinant protein in the complexes with the monomer form . b , the

the graphical illustration of the monomer forms and the complex forms of the nom recombinant protein and the hla-a * 11:01 and tlr4 immune receptors . \n\n in figure 8b and figure 8c , the rmsf values of the monomer forms of the immune receptors show lower values compared to the complex forms . this behavior is exactly the opposite of the nom designed protein . this can be an indication that the structures are very stable in their natural function and their structures considerably change when they get into contact with the designed nom protein . furthermore , the structural illustration of the monomer forms and also the complex forms of the vaccine and the immune receptors , figure 9 , shows that the vaccine can fill the cavities and bind tightly to them , as it was proved by the binding energies . \n\n conclusion \n\n covid-19 pandemic is much more than a health crisis . it leads to a political , social and economic crisis in the world . the development of a safe and effective vaccine could reduce the rate of this infection . immunoinformatics methods are valuable in reducing time and cost in vaccine design and other fields of life sciences . we have predicted and validated nom recombinant protein against hla-a * 11:01 and tlr4 receptors . our evaluation was based on vaccine candidate structural analysis and molecular docking and md simulations study . the nom-tlr4 and nom-hla-a * 11:01 complexes were very stable in their natural function with strong molecular interactions in around 100 ns . higher binding energy even after the md simulation of 100 ns confirmed the stability and specificity nom-tlr4 and nom- hla-a * 11:01 interaction . our vaccine candidate can stimulate both cellular and humoral immunity , given that b and t-cell epitopes have been selected in the final construct . taken all together , according to physicochemical evaluations as well as structural and immunological analyses , nom recombinant protein could be considered as a possible vaccine candidate against covid-19 . \n\n acknowledgements \n\n this work was supported by the hormozgan university of medical sciences under grant [ number : hums-rec.1398.647 ] , bandar

february , 2020 , china has 70 635 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , including 1772 deaths [ 1 ] . human-to-human spread of the virus via respiratory droplets is currently considered to be the main route of transmission . however , exhaled air dispersion during non-invasive respiratory support may increase the risk of coronavirus transmission , and requires more attention from medical personnel and patients . \n\n non-invasive respiratory support plays an essential role in the treatment of covid-19 . more awareness is needed of viral transmission through exhaled air . http : //bit.ly/39knrrf \n\n to the editor : \n\n as of 17 february , 2020 , china has 70 635 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , including 1772 deaths . human-to-human spread of the virus via respiratory droplets is currently considered to be the main route of transmission . however , exhaled air dispersion during non-invasive respiratory support may increase the risk of coronavirus transmission , and requires more attention from medical personnel and patients . \n\n according to the chinese centre for disease control and prevention , among 72 314 reported cases in mainland china ( 44 672 confirmed cases , 16 186 suspected cases , 10 567 clinically diagnosed cases , and 889 asymptomatic infected cases ) as of 11 february , 1716 medical staff were infected . notably , wang et al . analysed the clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalised cases with covid-19 and found that the nosocomial infection rate in the study was about 41.3 % , with 17 inpatients and 40 medical staff . given the high use of respiratory support to treat dyspnoea and respiratory failure induced by covid-19 , viral transmission through exhaled air should be considered . \n\n when oxygen is delivered through nasal catheter , mask or non-invasive ventilation ( niv ) , substantial exhaled air is released into the air , which can increase dispersion of the virus , and subsequently increase the risk of nosocomial infection . prior studies have suggested that the application of high-flow nasal cannula ( hfnc ) , niv through the specific mask with optimised vent holes or the helmet with a double-limb circuit may lower the risk of airborne transmission . performing non-invasive respiratory support in a single , well-ventilated , negative pressure ward is also considered a safe option . currently , however , the majority of patients are still receiving respiratory support through nasal catheter or common mask in general wards or emergency departments with limited medical resources . the potential for airborne transmission in this population has not received enough attention . furthermore , a significant proportion of suspected patients with mild to no symptoms who are managing at home may also require long-term home oxygen or niv treatment ( e.g . patients with advanced staged copd ) . these patients may increase the risk of family cluster infections by the widespread dispersion of exhaled air in their homes . \n\n non-invasive respiratory support plays an essential role in the treatment of covid-19 , and more awareness is needed regarding the increased risk of viral transmission from exhaled air . medical staff should utilise personal protective equipment when providing respiratory support therapy . patients should wear a medical mask when receiving conventional oxygen therapy or hfnc in order to reduce air dispersion . when performing niv therapy , because helmet resources are limited and they are not frequently used in routine clinical practice , we suggest avoiding masks with vent holes and adding a filter between the mask and the vent valve to reduce viral transmission . patient beds should be at least 1 m from one another and the ward air circulation rate needs to be increased . for patients with suspected covid-19 infection receiving long-term respiratory support at home , it is recommended that they stay in a single , well-ventilated room to avoid potentially infecting their family members . \n\n shareable pdf \n\n conflict of interest : l. guan has nothing to disclose .

00010010	early in the epidemic : impact of preprints on global discourse about covid-19 transmissibility \n\n since it was first reported by who in jan 5 , 2020 , over 80 000 cases of a novel coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) have been diagnosed in china , with exportation events to nearly 90 countries , as of march 6 , 2020 . given the novelty of the causative pathogen ( named sars-cov-2 ) , scientists have rushed to fill epidemiological , virological , and clinical knowledge gaps : resulting in over 50 new studies about the virus between january 10 and january 30 alone . however , in an era where the immediacy of information has become an expectation of decision makers and the general public alike , many of these studies have been shared first in the form of preprint papers : before peer review . \n\n for the past three decades , preprint servers have become commonplace in the scientific publication ecosystem , and covid-19 has prompted a seemingly unprecedented use of these platforms . although peer-review is crucial for the validation of science , the ongoing outbreak has showcased the speed with which preprints can disseminate information during emergencies . in this comment , we used both preprint and peer-reviewed studies that estimated the transmissibility potential ( ie , basic reproduction number [ r 0 ] ) of sars-cov-2 on or before feb 1 , 2020 to investigate the role that preprints have had in information dissemination during the ongoing outbreak . we also analysed the agreement of preprint estimates compared with those presented by peer-reviewed studies and propose a consensus-based approach for evaluating the validity of preprint findings during public health crises . for our analysis , we collected publicly available data from scientific studies , news reports , and search trends pertaining to sars-cov-2 and its r 0 . defined as the average number of secondary infections that a new case might transmit in a fully susceptible population , estimates of r 0 can provide decision makers with insights into the epidemic potential of a given outbreak . \n\n relevant news reports were discovered through mediacloud and search trends by use of google search trends , and both served as a proxy indicator for information dissemination . meanwhile , relevant scientific studies were discovered through a combination of searches executed with use of google scholar and , to address possible delays in indexing , four popular public preprint servers ( ie , arxiv , biorxiv , medrxiv , and social science research network [ ssrn ] ) that we believe are representative of the relevant preprint literature . search terms and specifications for each data source are outlined in the appendix ( p 2 ) . all studies discovered through google scholar , arxiv , biorxiv , medrxiv , and ssrn were manually checked for relevance to the topic area of interest . we retained only studies that included estimates for the r 0 associated with sars-cov-2 in the body of the text . \n\n r0 mean and range estimates from 11 different studies of covid-19 as a function of time \n\n for preprints that were revised before publication of the first relevant peer-reviewed study on jan 29 , the version number is indicated between parentheses as ( n ) . when multiple r0 estimates were presented in a single study because of the use of multiple approaches , the version number is followed by a single decimal place to indicate the approach used ( n.n ) . if a first author published more than one relevant independent study before feb 1 , the version number is followed immediately by an alphabetical marker ordered by date of publication ( nx ) . ranges presented vary by study ( eg , 95 % ci , 95 % credible interval , and so on ) and are presented in the appendix ( p 3 ) . r0=basic reproduction number . \n\n after this initial data discovery phase , which yielded 11 individual studies , date of first publication , publication platform , review status ( ie , preprint vs peer-reviewed ) , and methodological details were manually curated from each study ( appendix p 3 ) . r 0 estimates were also extracted from each study for further analysis . in the event of multiple r 0 estimates : because of preprint revisions after the first version or the use of multiple approaches in a single study : each estimate was recorded and treated as a separate entry to represent all available knowledge at any given point in time ( appendix p 3 ) . given that the first known preprint estimates for r 0 were posted to ssrn by us on jan 23 , we plotted search trend fractions and news report volume between jan 23 and feb 1 ( appendix p 4 ) . baseline data for both sources before jan 23 , 2020 , yielded negligible search trend interest and news report volume , and data collected up to feb 9 , 2020 , showed diminishing interest and volume after the catchment window ( appendix p 4 ) . to illustrate when each of the 11 relevant studies became available to the public , indicator bars were overlaid against the search trend and news report data by date of publication ( appendix p 4 ) . we then plotted each of the 16 r 0 estimates produced by the 11 studies , including both the mean and the estimate range ( eg , 95 % ci , 95 % credible interval , and so on ) presented ( appendix p 3 ) . estimates were plotted by date of publication and alphabetically there-in , offering a side-by-side comparison of preprint versus peer-reviewed results ; averages and 95 % cis were also computed for both groups ( figure ) . \n\n google search trends and mediacloud data suggested that both general ( ie , search ) interest and news media interest in the r 0 associated with covid-19 peaked before the publication of relevant peer-reviewed studies during the early stages of the epidemic . in the selected time frame , search interest peaked on jan 27 after a sharp increase between jan 23 and jan 25 immediately after the publication of five early preprint studies : all of which estimated r 0 : in biorxiv , medrxiv , and ssrn . meanwhile , news media interest peaked on jan 28 , coinciding with a sixth preprint study published in arxiv ( appendix p 4 ) . the first peer-reviewed estimates were then published by li and colleagues in the new england journal of medicine on jan 29 at 17:00 h ( eastern standard time ) , followed by four additional peer-reviewed studies in eurosurveillance , the international journal of infectious diseases , the lancet , and journal of clinical medicine up to feb 1 . average r 0 estimates across the preprint group were 3 61 ( 95 % ci 2 77-4 45 ) and 2 54 ( 2 17-2 91 ) across the peer-reviewed group : showing overlap in 95 % cis despite a wide diversity of modelling methods and data sources used both in-group and across-group ( appendix p 3 ) . although the average mean for the preprint group was higher than that for the peer-reviewed group , this effect was driven primarily by two upper-limit outlier estimates ( with r 0 higher than the 95 % ci maximum ; figure ) . exclusion of these two estimates by use of a consensus-based approach based on the 95 % cis yielded an average r 0 estimate of 3 02 ( 95 % ci 2 65-3 39 ) for the preprint group . notably , two studies in the peer-reviewed group had previously been published as preprints . although estimates presented by riou and althaus remained unchanged after peer review , estimates presented by zhao and colleagues were higher before peer review than afterwards . \n\n our findings suggest that , because of the speed of their release , preprints : rather than peer-reviewed literature in the same topic area : might be driving discourse related to the ongoing covid-19 outbreak . although our analysis focused on search trends and news media data as a measure for general discourse , it is likely that preprints are also influencing policy making discussions , given that who announced on jan 26 , 2020 , that they would be creating a repository of relevant studies : including those that have not yet been peer-reviewed . \n\n nevertheless , despite the advantages of speedy information delivery , the lack of peer review can also translate into issues of credibility and misinformation , both intentional and unintentional . this particular drawback has been highlighted during the ongoing outbreak , especially after the high-profile withdrawal of a virology study from the preprint server biorxiv , which erroneously claimed that covid-19 contained hiv `` insertions '' . the very fact that this study was withdrawn showcases the power of open peer-review during emergencies ; the withdrawal itself appears to have been prompted by outcry from dozens of scientists from around the globe who had access to the study because it was placed on a public server . much of this outcry was documented on twitter ( a microblogging platform ) and on longer-form popular science blogs , signalling that such fora would serve as rich additional data sources for future work on the impact of preprints on public discourse . however , instances such as this one described showcase the need for caution when acting upon the science put forth by any one preprint . \n\n with this in mind , taking multiple studies into consideration as presented in our analysis can help operationalise the kind of caution necessitated by preprints while simultaneously allowing for important , robust insights before the publication of a peer-reviewed study in the same topic area . here , we used a simple method in which we plotted the ten r 0 estimates that were posted as preprints before publication of the first peer-reviewed study on jan 29 ; we then took the average of these estimates and excluded the two estimates that qualified as upper-limit outliers : both upon visual inspection and as a function of the 95 % ci . even before outlier elimination , this simple method yielded average r 0 estimates similar to those presented by the peer-reviewed studies subsequently published on and after jan 29 ; however , more complex approaches that incorporate weighted averages based on estimate confidence , similar to traditional meta-analytical methods , offer a promising avenue for future work . such collective , consensus-based approaches will arguably be easiest to use when the research of interest is quantitative in nature ; nevertheless , given that many crucial epidemiological parameters that inform decision making ( eg , incubation period , generation time , and so on ) are quantitative , our proposed approach could work well in these contexts as well . \n\n our work showcases the powerful role preprints can have during public health crises because of the timeliness with which they can disseminate new information . furthermore , given that two of the preprints included in this analysis were later published in peer-reviewed outlets , the evidence shows that that even prestigious journals now permit the sharing of important findings before peer review and that the use of preprint platforms does not jeopardise future peer-reviewed publication . without question , primacy and peer-reviewed publications are key metrics in individual professional advancement ( eg , academic promotion ) ; nevertheless , the impact of preprints on discourse and decision making pertaining to the ongoing covid-19 outbreak suggests that we must rethink how we reward and recognise community contributions during present and future public health crises . \n\n references \n\n\n\n

10000000	clinical progression of covid-19 patient with extended incubation period , delayed rt-pcr time-to-positivity , and potential role of chest ct-scan . \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , previously called 2019-ncov , is a novel disease caused by sars- cov-2 which was first identified as outbreak of unknown respiratory illness in wuhan , china . covid- 19 was declared as global health emergency by who on march 11 , 2020 and quickly elevated to global pandemic on 11 march 2020 . covid-19 symptom is highly various in each patient , with fever , fatigue , shortness of breath , and cough as the main presenting symptoms . patient with covid-19 may shows severe symptom with severe pneumonia and ards , mild symptom resembling simple upper respiration tract infection , or even completely asymptomatic . approximately 80 % of cases is mild . however the number may changes as more people are getting tested . some experts are estimating that up to 50 % of all cases may be asymptomatic carrier . 
01100000	potential cytoprotective activity of ozone therapy in sars-cov-2/covid-19 . \n\n ( 1 ) background : the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) disease ( covid-19 ) in china at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak . systemic ozone therapy ( ot ) could be potentially useful in the clinical management of several complications secondary to sars-cov-2 . the rationale and mechanism of action has already been proven clinically in other viral infections and has been shown in research studies to be highly effective at decreasing organ damage mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress . this review summarizes the ot studies that illustrate the possible cytoprotective mechanism of action of ozone and its physiological by-products in target organs affected by sars-cov-2 . ( 2 ) methods : this review encompasses a total of 74 peer-reviewed original articles . it is mainly focused on ozone as a modulator of the nf-kappa b/nrf2 pathways and il-6/il-1beta expression . ( 3 ) results : in experimental models and the few existent clinical studies , homeostasis of the free radical and antioxidant balance by ot was associated with a modulation of nf-kappa b/nrf2 balance and il-6 and il-1beta expression . these molecular mechanisms support the cytoprotective effects of ot against tissue damage present in many inflammatory diseases , including viral infections . ( 4 ) conclusions : the potential cytoprotective role of ot in the management of organ damage induced by covid-19 merits further research . controlled clinical trials are needed . 
01001000	perspective from ecuador , the second country with more confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in south america : a review \n\n to face the pandemic outbreak of a novel coronavirus many countries developed a series of containment methods ; however , developing countries in south america had reacted apathetically to this worldwide concern . ecuador 's response to the novel virus coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) started on february 26 , 2020 , one month after the outbreak began in china . as of today , the countries with more confirmed cases in south america are brazil and ecuador . although brazil has two times the number of cases than ecuador ( brazil : 700 cases per 100000 people vs. ecuador : 400 cases per 100000 ) , the huge population difference between the two countries raises concerns about the public health policies implemented by the ecuadorian government . even though there is no cure for covid-19 , chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are promising alternatives . the covid-19 pandemic outbreak has shown that there is room for improvement in the healthcare systems worldwide and the disastrous results on the fragile often unprepared are those systems in developing countries . \n\n introduction and background \n\n alarm bells over the world started to ring after the news regarding a case of pneumonia caused by a novel virus in wuhan , china . the virus supposedly originated in one of the largest markets in wuhan . on january 7 , 2020 , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) isolated the virus and called it severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) . the disease caused by this virus was named coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) by the world health organization ( who ) . \n\n even though the majority of cases present with flu-like symptoms , 3.4 % of patients develop severe pneumonia , septic shock , respiratory failure , and multiorgan failure leading to a fatal outcome . \n\n on january 30 , 2020 , the who declared the covid-19 outbreak a global health emergency . countries applied many measures , hoping to contain the spread of the disease ; for example , restricting mobility and quarantines . additionally , incoming flights from countries with a high prevalence of the disease were suspended , first from china and then followed by italy and spain . \n\n in south america , brazil is the country with the highest number of covid-19-confirmed cases followed by ecuador . although brazil has two times the number of cases than ecuador , it is important to analyze the prevalence of the disease in the context of the countries ' population . while brazil , with a population of 212,559,417 , has a total of 1,549 confirmed cases ( 0.007 % ) ; ecuador , with a population of 17,567,751 , has 789 confirmed cases ( 0.004 % ) . the greater ratio of cases per population in ecuador raises the concern about the efficacy of the containment measures and public health policies taken by the country . \n\n the limitations of the healthcare systems in developing countries increase their chances of being affected more during a pandemic outbreak . \n\n review \n\n confirmed cases and ecuadorian response \n\n after the announcement that covid-19 was spreading rapidly across asian countries , european countries went into an alarm state and started to design containment measures while south american countries reacted apathetically , delaying decisions on preventive measures , underestimating the severity of the events . \n\n ecuador 's response to the novel virus covid-19 started on february 26 , 2020 . the set of measures included monitoring the temperature and other covid-19-related symptoms in travelers from high-risk countries . on february 29 , 2020 , ecuador confirmed the first case of covid-19 . the patient had arrived from spain two weeks before the diagnosis was made . \n\n after the who declared covid-19 as a pandemic outbreak on march 11 , 2020 , ecuador declared a national health emergency . all non-essential activities were suspended indefinitely and the use of virtual platforms was encouraged for academic activities , jobs , and medical care . as did other countries did , ecuador also closed its land , air , and sea borders to citizens and non-citizens for 21 days . restrictions to vehicular or pedestrian traffic and a national curfew from 7 pm to 5 am also took place . \n\n despite these measures , the virus continued spreading across the ecuadorian provinces . on march 23 , 2020 , 789 confirmed patients with covid-19 and 18 deaths related to the virus were reported by the ministry of health of ecuador . the mortality rate was similar to other countries . the number of confirmed patients increased , so did the number of people in epidemiological monitoring and quarantine . \n\n the infection risk in physicians also increases in countries with a high prevalence of sars-cov-2 . in italy , more than 3,000 health providers were infected becoming an increasing concern among health providers worldwide . in ecuador , 24 doctors have been tested positive for the virus one month after the first patient 's admission with covid-19 . the rising number of physicians testing positive for covid-19 raises concern amid a growing outcry over the shortage of protective equipment and medical supplies . \n\n guayas , with 607 confirmed cases , is by far the most affected province by covid-19 in ecuador . measures applied in the rest of the country with relative success failed in this province . the out-of-control increase in confirmed cases poses the risk of collapsing the health care system there . this situation led the government to declare the province as a national security zone , leaving operational planning to the army . \n\n transmission \n\n the transmission was described as animal-to-person in affected patients at the huanan seafood wholesale market of wuhan . at the moment , person-to-person transmission and fomite transmission have been linked with the spread of the illness . li compiled information on the dynamics of the novel virus , estimating a transmission rate of r0 2.2 for covid-19 . in addition , cascella mentions that close contact with an infected person is needed to transmit the virus . therefore , relatives and health professionals are at greater risk . \n\n there are some discrepancies about the transmission . while some studies support the animal-to-human transmission , including a case of a pet that tested positive for covid-19 , the cdc states that there is no evidence that pets can transmit the virus or present the symptomology of infection . \n\n prevention \n\n the main goal in the control of a pandemic outbreak is to achieve r0 less than 1 ( one positive patient can infect less than one extra person ) . to reach this goal , prevention is paramount . \n\n the who and cdc recommend avoiding contact with symptomatic people and agglomerations . basic hygiene practices , such as constant hand washing and the use of face masks in symptomatic patients , are also recommended to prevent the spread of the virus . \n\n many countries utilized quarantine and mobilization restrictions to control the spread ; however , these measures may not be sufficient in developing countries such as ecuador . \n\n pathophysiology \n\n the cause of covid-19 is a ribonucleic acid ( rna ) virus of the coronaviridae family called sars-cov-2 . although the exact pathophysiology of sars-cov-2 is unknown , its structural similarity with other viruses of the coronaviridae family allows an understanding of its dynamics and the evolution of the disease . the clinical presentation may vary from flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia similar to sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n channappanavar and granlinski mention that the most aggressive strains of the coronavirinae family , like sars-cov , have protein e in their envelope that stimulates nf-kb , a protein complex involved in cellular responses , including stress , cytokine signaling , response to viral infections , and apoptosis . protein e , along with other proteins , interferes with the host immune response ( tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) alpha and interleukin 6 ( il-6 ) ) . these processes produce uncontrolled inflammation , resulting in lung edema and fibrosis . \n\n treatment \n\n efforts to control covid-19 had been made by many countries , starting with investigations to develop a vaccine from the attenuated or inactive virus . the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases announced the beginning of the first trial on 45 volunteers between 18 and 55 years old . this first phase is estimated to last for six weeks . the kaiser research institute is evaluating the feasibility of the mrna-1723 vaccine . \n\n the management of patients with acute respiratory syndrome consists of assisted oxygen ventilation to achieve a saturation percentage of oxygen ( spo2 ) of 90 % and antipyretics . \n\n multiple drugs are being studied to treat covid-19 , with promising results . in the united states and china , a randomized clinical trial has been initiated to test the efficacy of remdesivir . at the moment , oseltamivir , a neuraminidase inhibitor , has been used more extensively . \n\n chloroquine , a drug used worldwide , has a promising effect in the treatment of severe pneumonia by covid-19 at a dose of 500 mg2 times a day ; however , zhou questions its use due to its side effects . instead of using chloroquine , zhou suggests hydroxychloroquine as an alternative treatment . hydroxychloroquine seems to attenuate the progression to more severe scenarios of covd-19 infection , although its dosage still needs further study . \n\n conclusions \n\n the low mortality of covid-19 may be the reason for developing countries underestimating the magnitude of this pandemic outbreak . the health care systems risk collapsing due to the increasing number of confirmed patients who need intensive care and the spread of the disease in health providers . the high demand for financial and human resources by this disease leads to a collateral increase in mortality from other causes . the covid-19 pandemic outbreak has shown that there is still room for improvement in healthcare systems worldwide to prevent its catastrophic impact , especially on the fragile and often unprepared systems in developing countries . \n\n the authors have declared that no competing interests exist . \n\n references \n\n cnn . ? cual es la tasa de mortalidad del coronavirus ?

00000100	covid-19 pneumonia with hemoptysis : acute segmental pulmonary emboli associated with novel coronavirus infection . \n\n recent retrospective studies from wuhan , china suggest novel coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) may be associated with a hypercoagulable state and increased risk for venous thromboembolism . the overlap in the signs and symptoms of covid-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) and covid-19 with concurrent pulmonary embolism creates a diagnostic challenge for emergency medicine physicians in patients already at risk for renal impairment . however , identifying features atypical for covid-19 alone may play a role in the judicious use of computed tomography angiography among these patients . hemoptysis is seen in roughly 13 % of pulmonary embolism cases and infrequently reported among covid-19 infections . additionally , the presence of right heart strain on electrocardiography ( ekg ) is a well described clinical presentations of pulmonary embolism not reported commonly with covid-19 infections . 
00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region , presented to the emergency with a 3-day history of headaches , dizziness , intermittent nausea , and vomiting . brain mr showed a tumor that was entirely confined within the third ventricle , causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the child has an uncomplicated recovery after surgery , and covid-19 was eventually ruled out after a 14-day quarantine . \n\n finally , we have some additional tips for conducting surgery under level 3 precautions . a comfortable goggle and use of antifogging agent are very helpful . in addition , surgeons should avoid unnecessary conversation and perform the surgery as gently as possible to prevent splashing blood in a negative pressure operating room . \n\n neuro-oncology patients may become infected with covid-19 , and thus surgery for these patients can not be avoided . as neurosurgeons , it is crucial that we do our utmost to care for our patients while ensuring our own safety at the same time . in these challenging times , we have faith that through our concerted efforts , this pandemic will be overcome soon . \n\n publisher 's note \n\n springer nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations . \n\n compliance with ethical

00001000	'let us help'- why senior medical students are the next step in battling the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n as senior medical students in the uk , we read dr stein 's letter on the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) 2 and began wondering where we fit in , in this pandemic . as the government heads into a 'war footing ' 13 , there is an increased need for medical staff . there is speculation of bringing back retired doctors , many of who fall into at risk categories . with clinical placement and exams cancelled , we are determined to use our hard-earned skills in some way , to help in what is the biggest global emergency of our lifetime . 
00001000	role of mask/respirator protection against sars-cov-2 \n\n to the editor \n\n since its outbreak on december 31 , 2019 , in wuhan , a central city in china , coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) has now spread to almost all countries in the world . it has been declared a pandemic , and it has infected over 1,041,126 people in a very short time , with 55,132 deaths as ofapril 3 , 2020 . wearing masks/respirators and practicingself-isolation at home have been recommended as guidelines for thepublic . however , the problem is the number of cases among medical personnel . interestingly , a higher risk of infection was noticed in male professionals . there are currently many types of masks/respirators available , ranging from simple surgical masks designed to protect wearers from microorganism transmission and fit loosely to the user 's face , through n95 masks used to prevent users from inhaling small airborne particles . these must fit tightly to the user 's face . masks differ primarily in their maximum internal leakage rate limit . surgical masks are designed to protect against droplets or particles with a diameter of > 100 mum , whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) virus is essentially spherical , albeit slightly pleomorphic , with a diameter of 60-140 nm and 100 times smaller than the pore diameter . thus , surgical masks can not prevent inhalation of small airborne particles ; however , both can protect users from large droplets and sprays . the pn-en 149:2001 standard defines 3 protection classes for half masks : filtering face piece 1 ( ffp1 ) , filtering face piece 2 ( ffp2 ) , and filtering face piece 3 ( ffp3 ) . the maximum internal leakage limit is 25 % for ffp1 , 11 % for ffp2 , and 5 % for ffp3 . class ffp1 masks retain about 80 % of particles smaller than 2 mum , ffp2 ones retain 94 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum , and ffp3 ones retain 99.95 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum ( table ) . \n\n test ffp1 ffp2 ffp3 concentration of harmful substances till 4 x nds till 10 x nds till 30 x nds leakage < 22 % < 8 % < 2 % penetration < 20 % < 6 % < 1 % initial expiration resistance at 95 l/min < 210 pa < 240 pa < 300 pa \n\n filtration efficiency for each class of masks \n\n abbreviations : ffp1 , filtering face piece 1 ; ffp2 , filtering face piece 2 ; ffp3 , filtering face piece 3 ; nds , the highest acceptable concentration of the harmful factor . \n\n at the moment , we may meet divergent recommendations for the use of masks . while the centers for disease control and prevention recommend the use of masks in low-risk and high-risk situations , the world health organization advises applying masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations . long et al conclude in their meta-analysis that the use of n95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza . they suggest that n95 respirators should not be recommended for the general public and non-high-risk medical staff who are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients . \n\n the potential of face masks to reduce the spread of respiratory infections could be useful . wang et al indicated that 10 of 213 medical professionals with no mask were infected by covid-19 as compared with 0 of 278 wearing n95 respirators . \n\n it is also worth noting that the respirator increases resistance to inhalation . the longer they are used , the more difficult breathing becomes because of more absorbed dust . what is more , the effectiveness decreases with the increase of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the respirator and face ( the so-called dead space ) . the concentration of carbon dioxide in the dead space increases with each subsequent exhalation . therefore , masks should be replaced frequently . additionally , to improve the comfort of use , masks use 1-way exhalation valves , which accelerate the circulation of gases.6 \n\n to conclude , the use of protective masks can and should be the first protection against sars-cov-2 transmission to medical personnel . medical personnel should use class ffp3 masks . additionally , the application of visors to cover the entire face during contact with the patient is worth considering . \n\n references \n\n association between 2019-ncov transmission and n95 respirator use . \n\n comparison of performance of three different types of respiratory protection devices . \n\n protecting healthcare staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome : filtration capacity of multiple surgical masks . \n\n a close shave ? performance of p2/n95 respirators in health care workers with facial hair : results of the beards ( adequate respiratory defences ) study . \n\n effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza : a systematic review and meta-analysis . \n\n cloth masks versus medical masks for covid-19 . 
00001000	emergency trauma care during the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in china \n\n background \n\n a novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in wuhan , hubei province , in december 2019 ; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans . china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease . however , a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking . to regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak , we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in wuhan . \n\n main body \n\n the article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 , indications for emergency surgery , and infection prevention and control for medical personnel , providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period . \n\n conclusions \n\n the measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of covid-19 . \n\n background \n\n a novel corona virus disease ( covid-19 ) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) began in wuhan , hubei province , china , in december 2019 . by february 13 , 2020 , more than 60,000 cases were confirmed , nearly 50,000 in hubei alone , and the source of the infection was yet to be definitely determined . the world health organization ( who ) has declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) . considering the current rate of human to human transmission , most countries in the world should be well prepared for the potential global covid-19 pandemic . china is on the frontline in the fight against the virus , and medical staff have become exhausted due to the excessive workload brought on by the outbreak . medical testing tools and personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , such as face shields , goggles , and gloves , have become scarce and have had to be rationed among teams and medical centers , with severe shortage in hubei , the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak . a report from a neurosurgery department of a teaching hospital in wuhan showed that from december 25 , 2019 , to february 6 , 2020 , eight covid-19 suspected patients were admitted , and three were confirmed . consequently , 12 medical personnel were infected ( 11 nurses and one doctor ) , among whom three had been in close contact with the first confirmed case . according to the data released by the national health commission ( nhc ) of the people 's republic of china , a total of 1716 medical personnel infections had been reported nationwide , accounting for 3.8 % of the total confirmed cases by 24:00 on february 11 , 2020 , of which six ( 0.4 % ) had died . of these , hubei province reported 1502 cases , accounting for 87.5 % of the total medical personnel infections , while wuhan city reported 1102 cases , accounting for 73.4 % . notably , medical personnel are the most valuable resource during the outbreak . how to protect them from infection is one of the foremost challenges in the fight against sars-cov-2 . \n\n although china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of sars-cov-2 , severe trauma can still occur . during the outbreak , the population of trauma patients may be diverse in terms of infection status , including patients who were previously healthy , suspected to be infected , confirmed infected , close contacts of infected individuals , and asymptomatic carriers . thus , balancing optimal trauma care while preventing further spread of the viral infection during the outbreak is a major challenge . \n\n to our knowledge , there is no relevant consensus or clinical guideline available on the indications of , timing of or perioperative protection during emergency surgery for trauma . to protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of trauma care , we have summarized the recommended perioperative infection prevention and control measures for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 based on current practical experience in china and the published literature on surgical practice during the past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) , ebola virus , and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n main text \n\n general principles \n\n special requirements for the hospitals receiving trauma patients during the outbreak \n\n emergency department : set up a triage area for assessment of all patients at admission , allowing early recognition of possible sars-cov-2 infection and immediate isolation of patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection in an area separate from other patients . \n\n radiology department : a dedicated ct room should be kept on standby for the examination of infected patients . \n\n operating room ( or ) : a relatively isolated negative-pressure or is preferable ; if there is no permanent negative-pressure or , a temporarily modified negative-pressure or the main operating suite of the hospital can be converted . \n\n intensive care unit ( icu ) : an isolated area should be prepared in the icu , and suspected patients should be treated in a single space . \n\n intrahospital transport : although an ideal trauma center with a door-to-door ct room and negative-pressure or are preferable in this situation , most regions in china do not operate such facilities . therefore , a predetermined transport route should be used to minimize exposure , and any intrahospital transport should utilize dedicated carts demarcated by a warning logo equipped with protective supplies and hand disinfectants . the patient should wear a medical mask , and the walls and the floor of the passageways and the elevator should be covered with a plastic lining . \n\n to control the spread of covid-19 , basic principles for treating infectious diseases should be followed , and necessary measures should be taken before receiving trauma patients . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n precaution level applicable personnel and scenarios personal protective equipment level 1 triage , emergency department clean non-sterile long gown , disposable head cover , disposable medical mask , and gloves . level 2 close contact with suspected patients , or handling secretions , feces , and personal items belonging to patients ; performing ct scan ( fig . 1 ) disposable head cover , gloves , disposable coverall , n95 respirator or equivalent , goggle or face shield , rubber boots or fluid-resistant overshoes , etc . level 3 close contact with suspected patients , or collecting blood , respiratory tract samples of patients , especially for endotracheal intubation , airway care , and sputum suction , as well as emergency surgery ( fig . 2 ) . on the basis of wearing secondary protective equipment such as goggle or face shield , other protective equipment should be strengthened . for instance , adding disposable surgical clothing and gloves in addition to disposable coverall and gloves . two layers of gloves covering protective clothing and surgical clothes sleeves , respectively , use of a powered air purifying respirator ( papr ) . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n to standardize and simplify the precaution measures and equipment required for different personnel and scenarios in trauma care , we adopted a three-level precaution protocol in trauma care ( table 1 ) . \n\n all levels of precaution were based on implementing standard precautions , including hand hygiene , respiratory hygiene , and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment ( ppe ) according to different risk levels . proper training of the standard donning and doffing procedures is the basis of effective protection . in epidemic areas such as hubei province , all patients can be regarded as potentially suspected patients during the outbreak , and the level of the precaution should be elevated . \n\n triage \n\n classification of the patients suspected cases clinical confirmed cases ( hubei only ) pathogenic confirmed cases diagnostic basis outside hubei province : two of the clinical manifestations with at least one of the epidemiological histories , three of the clinical manifestations without epidemiological history suspected patient in hubei province with ct findings of pneumonia suspected or clinically confirmed patients with at least one pathogenic evidence epidemiological investigation 1 . travel to or residence in wuhan in the 14 days prior to symptom onset ; 2 . close contactb with sars-cov-2 infection ( rrt-pcr positive ) within 14 days before onset ; 3 . exposed to patients from wuhan and surrounding areas , or from a community with patients who reported fever or respiratory symptoms14 d before onset ; 4 . clustering outbreak . - - clinical manifestations and ct scan 1 . fever and/or respiratory symptoms ; 2 . imaging characteristics of covid-19 ( ct : multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes in early stage , which are obvious in the peripheral lung , and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs , and lung consolidation may occur in severe cases ) ; 3 . the total number of white blood cells in the early stage is normal or decreased , and the lymphocyte count is decreased - - pathogenic evidence null null 1 . detection of sars-cov-2 in respiratory specimens and sera by rrt-pcr assays ; 2 . by virus dna sequencing , respiratory or blood samples dna sequence highly homologous with sars-cov-2 . \n\n diagnostic criteria of covid-19a \n\n covid-19 coronavirus induced disease , sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 , rrt-pcr real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \n\n athe diagnostic criteria were defined according to guidance for the diagnosis and management for covid-19 ( 5th edition ) released by national health commission of people 's republic of china in feb. 4 , 2020 \n\n bclose contact is defined as follows : \n\n - healthcare-associated exposure , including providing direct care for covid-19 patients , working with healthcare workers infected with novel coronavirus , visiting patients , or staying in the same close environment as a covid-19 patient \n\n - working together in close proximity or sharing the same classroom environment with a covid-19 patient \n\n - traveling together with a covid-19 patient in any kind of conveyance \n\n - living in the same household as a covid-19 patient \n\n trauma patients during the outbreak should be managed using the relevant contents in table 2 , and they should complete a brief epidemiological investigation at the triage stage . however , the trauma patients ' history may be unreliable , as they may not have time to be detailed . more emphasis should be placed on the objective data . during the outbreak in wuhan , a total of 32 emergency operations were performed in a tertiary care hospital , including 19 suspected and seven pathogenic confirmed cases . in addition , nine covid-19 patients in another tertiary care hospital underwent gastrointestinal surgery , but in all of these patients , covid-19 was diagnosed postoperatively . it is worth noting that there have been many cases of asymptomatic patients with an incubation period . the maximum incubation period was reported to be 24 days . \n\n evaluation \n\n trauma care is highly time dependent and requires rapid and effective evaluation and management . during the outbreak , primary and secondary surveys should be completed while maintaining the premise of effective protection . \n\n general principles of evaluation \n\n dynamic evaluation strategies should be conducted throughout the trauma care process . the personal protective equipment ( ppe ) worn by medical personnel may result in limited or incomplete physical examinations ( such as palpation and auscultation ) . therefore , injury assessment may rely on radiological examinations . \n\n radiology evaluation \n\n a chest ct scan is recommended for all severe trauma patients if there is no contraindication . if the chest ct scan is not possible due to critical condition , the patient should be treated as a suspect for infection until infection is excluded . \n\n level 3 ppe during ct examination \n\n if the hospital has a trauma resuscitation unit , complete x-ray including but not limited to the chest and focused assessment with sonography for trauma ( fast ) in the trauma resuscitation unit should be performed . for hemodynamic stabilization , a ct scan including but not limited to the chest should be performed ( fig . 1 ) . if the hospital does not have a trauma resuscitation unit , patients with hemodynamic instability should be resuscitated in the emergency department and undergo fast simultaneously . once the hemodynamic status is stable enough , the ct scan should be performed as soon as possible . \n\n ct scan protocol for trauma patients suspected of having covid-19 : medical personnel should first determine the method and scope of the scan , including but not limited to the chest , according to the mechanism of injury . for stab wounds , the segment and body cavity near the wound should be examined . for gunshot wounds , due to the high kinetic energy of the projectiles , the tortuous wound path , and the heavy tissue damage , the scanning range should be expanded appropriately . patients who have sustained blunt injuries with high energy , such as traffic injuries , should usually be scanned with enhanced scanning ranging from head to mid-thigh ( including the whole lower limb when there is lower limb injury ) . enhanced scanning is helpful in providing further information on organ injury , and three-dimensional reconstruction of blood vessels and bone should be performed when major vascular and bone injury is suspected . \n\n ct features of covid-19 : it should be noted that the pulmonary imaging changes of covid-19 vary depending on the patient 's age , immunity status , stage of disease at the time of the scan , underlying disease , and drug intervention . reports have shown that in the early stage of infection , ct shows multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes , which are obvious in the peripheral lung and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs . in severe cases , lung consolidation could occur . in addition , special attention should be paid to discerning between covid-19 infection and pulmonary contusion . \n\n blood and pathogen specimen collection \n\n if possible , nasopharyngeal swabs , sputum , lower respiratory tract secretions , and blood samples should be collected and sent for rrt-pcr in the emergency period . if no respiratory tract specimens are collected before the operation due to time constraints , they can be collected during or after the operation . \n\n all specimens shall be deemed to be potentially infectious . collection , transportation , and processing of any clinical specimens should be performed by biological safety training qualified medical staff . level 3 precautions should be adopted to minimize the possibility of exposure . \n\n the results of rrt-pcr may be falsely negative due to the influence of sampling , transportation , extraction , and testing . recent observations have shown that 30 to 40 % of patients with covid-19 ct features were rrt-pcr negative . as a result , the protection standard can not be lowered due to negative results . since the rrt-pcr test can take several hours to confirm the diagnosis , chest ct is recommended as the basis for the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 in suspected patients , especially in areas with a high incidence of the disease . the use of chest ct not only helps to control the spread of the epidemic but can also ensure definitive care for trauma injuries in a timely manner . \n\n emergency surgery \n\n emergency surgery is of great importance for severe trauma patients , the aim of which includes hemorrhage control , contamination abatement , and compartment pressure relief as soon as possible . effective prevention of sars-cov-2 transmission by standard intraoperative protective measures is an important indicator of a successful operation . from the available evidence , sars-cov-2 is spread mainly through respiratory droplets and contact , while aerosol and fecal-oral transmission are still under investigation . from the existing evidence and our practical experience , all medical staff should adopt level 3 precautions when entering the or . \n\n or preparation \n\n an independent negative pressure operation room is the first choice . operations can only be performed when the pressure is between - 10 and - 5 pa . if a negative pressure or is not available , a relatively isolated or with an independent purification system is an alternative option . nevertheless , the purification system should be shut down during the operation , and a final disinfection should be performed postoperatively . as in standard trauma protocols , the more critical patient should be operated on first . if two or more suspected or confirmed infected patients arrive in the or , a 30-min disinfection is warranted before the subsequent operation . the dedicated or should be clearly marked as covid-19 exclusive . \n\n the dedicated covid-19 or should be designed with a special passage and elevator . the design should focus on shortening the outdoor distance , reducing the chance of human contact , and limiting the time spent in suspected contaminated areas . materials and equipment should only be delivered by specially assigned staff . people inside the or are not allowed to leave during the operation , and outdoor personnel should not enter without permission . surgical articles should be clearly identified , and the use of disposable items is recommended . to maintain pressure , surgical supplies ( surgical instruments , dressings , single-use consumables , high-value consumables , medications , and relevant items ) should be well prepared in advance . only unidirectional flow is permitted ( nothing should be taken out once it is entered during the operation ) . personnel movement and the frequency of door opening are strictly limited . nondisposable items should be disposed of postoperatively in strict accordance with regulations . two suction apparatuses are optimal , one of which is for exclusive use by the anesthesiologist . the negative pressure aspirator should be immediately placed on the patient 's face to minimize the spread of respiratory secretions after entering the operation room . \n\n ppe for operation personnel \n\n protective clothing for surgical personnel : a after wearing protective clothing and inner gloves , b after wearing operating clothes and outer gloves \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe donning \n\n the topic of intraoperative protection remains controversial because most surgeons have no experience performing surgery while wearing heavy and airproof contagion gowns and goggles . according to practice in china , some medical personnel wore two surgical gowns , two contagion gowns and four pairs of gloves for surgery during the covid-19 epidemic . instead of enhancing protective effects , such excessive protection can reduce the visual , auditory , and tactile sensitivity of the surgeon , thus reducing the precision of surgical operations ( fig . 2 ) . the influence of excessive protection on the surgeon mainly includes ( 1 ) difficulty breathing , ( 2 ) fog on goggles and face shields that interfere with vision , ( 3 ) constriction of visual fields , ( 4 ) loss of flexibility due to multiple layers of gloves , and ( 5 ) double or triple the duration of the operation . a practical lesson had been learned from the case of a 7-year-old girl with suspected covid-19 infection who was subjected to an urgent craniotomy due to obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a third ventricle germ cell-derived tumor . the surgical team adopted a level 3 precaution including n95 respirators or papr , and full coverage with protective gowns ( shoe covers included ) and sterile surgical gowns . consequently , an operation that would have taken 2-3 h ended up taking 10 h. possible solutions for reducing the impact of ppe on surgery include reducing the or temperature ( minimizing the formation of moisture on goggles ) and enhancing the lighting in the room to obtain better vision . all ppes are fit for single use except papr . the steps of donning and doffing should be completed under professional supervision ( fig . 3 ) . \n\n anesthesia \n\n regional nerve block is the first choice for limb surgeries . general anesthesia is recommended for neurosurgery , torso trauma , or multiple trauma with shock . \n\n attention should be paid to avoid aerosol generation caused by coughing and other causes in airway operations . intubation should be performed after rapid induction and full muscle relaxation to ensure complete disappearance of spontaneous breathing , and sputum aspiration before intubation should be avoided . remote endotracheal intubation by disposable glide scope with an assistant is recommended . awake endotracheal intubation is not recommended for patients with a difficult airway , hypoxia , or unconsciousness . if face mask or laryngeal mask ventilation is able to maintain oxygenation , multiple tools ( fiberoptic bronchoscope , glide scope , light stick , laryngeal mask ) can be used to assist endotracheal intubation after rapid induction of general anesthesia . if not , cricothyroid laryngotomy should be performed without any hesitation . rapid induction via oral intubation is recommended in cases of a possibly full stomach . mask positive pressure ventilation after administration should be avoided . no emetic measure is recommended . extra caution should be taken on when a nasogastric tube is in place . covid-19 can cause pulmonary inflammation that can induce added lung injury , restricted crystal fluid , and protective ventilation . the proper mechanical ventilation parameters include limited tidal volume ( < 8 ml/kg ) and airway pressure ( platform pressure < 30 cm h2o ) ; 5-10 cm h2o positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation ( peep ) is optional for alveoli expansion and oxygenation maintenance . permissive hypercapnia is also acceptable . \n\n surgical strategy \n\n the concept of damage control surgery should be followed to simplify the operation . it is optimal to finish an operation within 90 min , and strategies such as packing hemostasis , external fixation , and temporary abdominal closure are helpful to shorten the operation time . surgical personnel should be highly focused and closely coordinated . gentle movement is essential to avoid accidental injury and contamination caused by the spattering of blood , fluid , and bone debris . limiting rinsing and drainage of bodily fluids is another key to effectively reducing intraoperative contamination . reliable hemostasis should be maintained to prevent bleeding around the incision . excessive negative pressure suction and violent operations are prohibited . it is also suggested that electrotome use is not suitable under this scenario ; if it must be used , the power should be minimized . smoke should be quickly suctioned to avoid aerosol generation . \n\n postoperative management \n\n postoperative management of patients \n\n after the operation , the patient should be transferred to an isolation ward in the icu . the endotracheal tubes should be removed under analgesia to avoid violent coughing while the patient is stable . sputum aspiration should be performed by a closed suction system . trauma and surgery can impair the patient 's immune function . clinically , some asymptomatic covid-19 patients suffered rapid deterioration after surgery . surgeons and anesthesiologists should be aware that acute lung injury caused by covid-19 may exist preoperatively or worsen postoperatively . therefore , special attention should be paid to the monitoring of body temperature , infection , and hemodynamic index . reexamination of chest ct and rrt-pcr tests is also important . for postoperative trauma patients with fever , traumatic , or operative complications should also be considered to differentiate them from covid-19 . attention should be paid to symptomatic and etiological treatment . postoperative dyspnea and hypoxia should also be differentiated from complications such as pulmonary embolism . nutritional support and prevention of other complications ( bacterial infection , stress ulcer , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , and deep venous thrombosis ) should also be strengthened . \n\n quarantine \n\n based on current experience , if the medical personnel complete the operation successfully and comply with all the regulations without any accidental exposure , the patient does not need to be quarantined . otherwise , a 14-day medical observation is obligatory , and timely treatment is needed when any abnormalities occur . notably , some literature recommends a routine 14-day quarantine for relevant personnel involved in the operation for sars-cov-2 confirmed patients . however , extreme safety often results in severe incapacity to help patients , so a balance between safety and efficiency must be maintained . \n\n discussion \n\n the national health commission of china initially decided to temporarily call the disease novel coronavirus pneumonia or ncp . it was not until february 12 , 2020 , that the official name covid-19 was announced by the who . shortly after the who announced the disease 's official name , the virus causing it was named sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , highlighting the new virus 's similarity to the sars virus identified in 2003 . based on epidemiological data up to jan. 4 , 2020 , the estimated r0 was 2.2 ( 95 % ci , 1.4 to 3.9 ) , while the latest study surveying cases up to feb. 14 , 2020 , further calculated that the r0 of covid-19 was 3.77 . therefore , researchers estimated that in terms of infection ability , sars-cov-2 was slightly higher than the sars virus and significantly higher than the mers-cov . according to clinical characteristic analysis of sars-cov-2 infection in china , the mortality was 2.01 % out of 28,018 cases as of feb. 6 , 2020 . by human-to-human transmission , sars-cov-2 had spread rapidly from wuhan , china , to 24 other countries as of feb. 12 , 2020 . the number of cases within china and other countries is rapidly increasing , and it is estimated that for every additional 10 % decrease in transmission rate , the peak population will be reduced by 20-47 % . the cumulative number of infected cases and deaths will be reduced by 23-49 % due to comprehensive interventions . if current interventions continue , it is expected that the number of people infected will peak in early march 2020 . based on the epidemiological analysis , only 1.18 % of the patients had direct contact with wild animals , 31.30 % of the patients had been in wuhan , and 71.80 % of the patients had contact with people from wuhan . common symptoms included fever , cough , and diarrhea . a total of 76.4 % of patients had radiologic findings manifested as pneumonia , with the remaining patients exhibiting normal radiologic findings . poor clinical outcomes can be predicted by disease severity , including oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count , and chest ct manifestations . \n\n the transmission by aerosols is still under investigation . aerosols are solid , liquid , solid , and liquid granular substances suspended in the air , such as dust , smoke , fog , and microorganisms . these may be the `` flying vehicles '' for covid-19 . covid-19 aerosols are related to the increased risk of covid-19 transmission . tracheal intubation , noninvasive ventilation , tracheotomy , manual ventilation before intubation , bronchoscopy , cardiopulmonary resuscitation , sputum suction , and other airway operations , as well as the use of electrotome , suction , and drainage , all inevitably produce a large number of aerosols . when carrying out these operations , the protection and training of medical personnel should be strengthened , and preventive measures to protect against aerosols are recommended , including n95 respirators , papr , goggles or face shields , disposable fluid-resistant gowns , and limiting the number of people in the room . \n\n based on experience from the hospital in wuhan , patients with covid-19 have high mortality after surgery . as of february 14 , 2020 , 6 gastrointestinal operations were performed in the general surgery department of the authors ' hospital ; one 60-year-old male died of respiratory failure 14 days after surgery , and one died of septic shock , for a mortality rate of 33.33 % . another group of eight covid-19 confirmed patients in zhongnan hospital of wuhan university underwent gastrointestinal surgeries ( seven gastrointestinal tumors and one benign case ) ; one patient died of covid-19 after left hemicolectomy with the diagnosis of postoperative recurrence of renal cancer involving the descending colon with intestinal obstruction , and one tumor patient died from postoperative complications of abdominal infection , for a mortality rate of 25 % . trauma patients usually have massive hemorrhage , shock , and contamination . damage control strategies should be complied with to correct fatal triads caused by hypothermia , acidosis , and coagulopathy . meanwhile , effective oxygen therapy and organ function support are also indispensable . \n\n moreover , additional attention should be paid to patients in critical condition and to those who develop severe pneumonia after trauma . among covid-19 patients , critical patients , including patients with respiratory failure , septic shock , and other organ failures , have accounted for 29 % ~32 % . identifying high-risk groups with severe illness can also help reduce the occurrence of poor prognosis . the possible high-risk groups include patients over 65 years old , patients with obesity , and patients with other diseases ( such as chronic pulmonary disease , hypertension , heart disease , kidney disease , diabetes , tumor , and immune deficiency ) . \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe doffing \n\n the covid-19 outbreak poses significant challenges to hospital staff and specifically trauma surgeons , which must offer optimal and timely care despite the circumstances . strict safety protocols must be adhered to when carrying out emergency care for patients with severe trauma and other surgical diseases , which means that all the measures shall be carried out to preserve the ability of the medical staff to achieve the purpose of effective care without sacrificing the safety of all involved . the perspectives in this paper can not be a substitute for clinical judgment and expert consultation but can help provide up-to-date guidance on the clinical management of emergency surgery for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 ( fig . 4 ) . \n\n conclusion \n\n in conclusion , the covid-19 outbreak raises several issues concerning the safety of medical personnel and patients . areas with high incidence rates of covid-19 should conduct operations with caution and protection should be strengthened while ensuring suitable facilities to carry out optimal care with maximal safety . with the accumulation of clinical experience and in-depth research , some of the practices may require modification when additional high-quality evidence emerges . the above is china 's experience in treating trauma patients during the covid-19 outbreak . we hope that this report will help hospitals worldwide prepare for future covid-19 outbreaks and infection control in unexpected conditions . \n\n abbreviations \n\n covid-19 \n\n corona virus disease \n\n sars-cov-2 \n\n severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \n\n

00001000	applications of 3d printing technology to address covid-19 related supply shortages \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) was first identified in an outbreak in wuhan , china on december 8 , 2019 . globally , the number of affected covid-19 patients is growing exponentially , with the death toll exceeding 27,300 as of march 27 , 2020 . worldwide , there is a limited supply of n95 respirator masks , face shields , ventilator valves , testing kits and other personal protective equipment . thus , adequate production and distribution of personal protective equipment is critical during this pandemic . to address these shortages , three-dimensional ( 3d ) printing , a novel and innovative technology used to fabricate complex architectures , is well suited . 3d printing is an adjustable , robotic platform allowing for tailored deposition of biomaterials using computer-aided design systems to formulate layer-by-layer custom designs with controlled architecture and composition . \n\n masks \n\n n95 respirators masks have two advantages over surgical , paper or cloth masks : 1 ) they are > 95 % efficient at filtering 0.3-microm airborne particles and 2 ) they are fit tested to each user to ensure an adequate seal , such that air and small droplets do not enter around the edges of the mask and into the health care worker 's breathing zone . the centers for disease control and prevention recommends n95 masks for health care workers taking care of patients with covid-19 . \n\n 3d printing can be used to produce tailored seal designs for improving mask comfort and fit . to customize face mask seals , 3d laser scanning can be implemented to scan exact facial parameters , with a tailored and customized face seal n95 template . anthropometric data of the chin arc , jawline , face and nose lengths , and nose protrusion measurements can be taken into account with this customized seal . in a study using face seal prototypes with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic using a fused deposition modeling 3d printer , three subjects showed improved contact pressure compared with use of 3m 8210 n95 ffr respirator masks . moreover , a personalized mask may account for facial hair length and density for a more precise fit . \n\n displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . the biomaterials displayed in this image have been fully characterized in the medical literature , with the same material composition of n95 masks . the mask includes several layers thereby ensure effective filtration of viral particles . \n\n figure 1 \n\n standard n95 masks consist of filtration material composed of electrostatic non-woven polypropylene ( pp ) fibers which are semi-rigid , lightweight and fatigue resistant . the semi-crystalline structure may cause significant distortion of the 3d printed parts upon cooling thereby making 3d printing difficult . material extrusion 3d printing was used to design a 3d printable thermoplastic elastomeric material from a blend of polypropylene ( pp ) and styrene- ( ethylene-butylene ) -styrene ( sebs ) . this blend provides better printability and flexibility for n95 mask design . pp is commonly used for various industrial applications due to its low cost , processability , printability , recyclability and mechanical integrity . sebs is a polymeric elastomer with low processing temperature and low distortion during extrusion . thus , the pp/sebs combination would improve the processability of 3d printed n95 masks . moreover , controlling the thermoplastic elastomer ratio allows for tailoring the flexibility and elasticity of the 3d model material for better fitted masks . 3d melt electrospinning printing can also be used to create pp microfibers with sequential layering to accurately obtain a 3d form . thus , 3d printing procedures may allow for the creation of stable and biocompatible n95 masks that are comparable to industrial manufacturing brands . figure 1 displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . \n\n face shields \n\n polycarbonate and polyester , polyvinyl chloride and other synthetic polymers are commonly used to make surgical face shields . these biomaterials are transparent , lightweight and provide high optical clarity . the polymers can easily be printed using 3d technology to meet the needs of healthcare workers treating covid-19 . \n\n covid-19 specimen collection kit \n\n creating 3d printed test swabs would help increase covid-19 testing capacity . nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs can be made from a flexible polymer , using polystyrene for the shaft . the tip can be tailored to be micro fine using computer-aided design software . thereafter , swab bud lattice fibers can be made from calcium alginate using hydrogels using 3d tissue engineering . \n\n ventilator valves \n\n ventilator valves are attachments used to deliver oxygen at fixed concentrations for patients with acute respiratory distress , including covid-19 patients . 3d printing technology can be used via a filament extrusion system or a polymer-laser powder bed fusion process to print single-use valve sets . 3d printers can design the different elements of the valve using biomaterials such as polyamide and polysulfone , polycarbonate , silicone rubber and stainless steel . furthermore , these disposable valves eliminate time-consuming sterilization . \n\n medications \n\n 3d printing techniques , such as fused filament , inkjet , extrusion and powder extrusion , allow for fabrication of 3d printed pills . medication-printing technologies typically utilize a small nozzle to lay thin disc-shaped layers of powders and deposit microscopic droplets of liquid to bind the materials . a coaxial needle extrusion 3d technology was used to print active pharmaceutical ingredients and create combinations of controlled dosing of drugs . while there are no specific antivirals or vaccines for treatment of covid-19 , several well-characterized anti-viral drugs are being considered as therapies . it may be possible to use 3d medication-printing technology to effectively and rapidly print lopinavir/ritonavir , chloroquine , and hydroxychloroquine pills . thus , 3d technology has the potential to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry , making drug research , development and production applicable to covid-19 patients . \n\n as the covid-19 outbreak rapidly evolves , there has been a personal protective equipment shortage globally . 3d printing inventions can be rapidly applied to address these deficiencies . cost , processing time , testing , and manpower are potential barriers to creating 3d-printed personal protective equipment . however , the synthetic polymer biomaterials needed for 3d-printed personal protective equipment are exact or very similar in composition to the standard manufacturing grade products ( i.e . n95 masks provides the same fluid barrier and air filtration protection ) . moreover , these synthetic polymer materials are readily available and cost effective ( i.e . polypropylene is 12.47 cents per pound ) . 3d printer costs vary but are an excellent investment with labor performed via robotics . in conjunction with flattening the curve via social distancing , this pioneering technology can provide adequate personal protective equipment for health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic . \n\n abbreviations : \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) \n\n three-dimensional ( 3d ) \n\n polypropylene ( pp ) \n\n

00010010	transmission potential of the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) onboard the diamond princess cruises ship , 2020 \n\n an outbreak of covid-19 developed aboard the princess cruises ship during january-february 2020 . using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members , we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak . our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore ( approximate range : 1.1-7 ) . our findings suggest that rt decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control . most recent estimates of rt reached values largely below the epidemic threshold , indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n introduction \n\n while the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) spread rapidly throughout china for several weeks since december 2019 , the virus had not taken off outside china in part due to the unprecedented social distancing measures that the chinese government put in place . one exception is the outbreak of covid-19 that developed aboard the diamond princess ship which was detected in early february when one of its passengers , a traveler from hong kong , tested positive for the novel coronavirus . the number of cases in the diamond princess ship quickly jumped to 454 confirmed cases by february 18 , 2020 . in contrast , the total number of cases in singapore , one of the countries with the highest number of covid-19 cases after china , was only 77 at the time . \n\n accumulating evidence indicates that the novel coronavirus can spread widely in confined settings including hospitals , cruise ships , prisons , and churches . in wuhan city , china , outbreaks inside health care settings led to the infection of hundreds of health professionals . in tokyo , japan , most of the reported infections have been linked to a party inside a traditional wooden ship , called yakatabune while most of the infections in korea have affected members of one church and one hospital . \n\n tracking the evolution of the transmission potential of covid-19 in different confined settings and how it compares with that of other respiratory diseases such influenza has public health implications . when outbreaks occur in confined settings , it is useful to investigate how the effective reproduction number changes as a result of interventions strategies such as the quarantine that the japanese government imposed on travelers and crew members aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n in this study we sought to characterize the temporal variation in the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak aboard the princess cruises ship using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data by dates of symptoms onset describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members . \n\n epidemiological incidence cases \n\n in yokohama , japan , an outbreak of covid-19 has been unfolding on board the princess cruise ship , which has been under quarantine orders since february 5 , 2020 , after a former passenger of the diamond princess ship tested positive for the virus after disembarking in hong kong . as of february 22 , 2020 , two days after the scheduled two-week quarantine came to an end , a total of 621 symptomatic and asymptomatic people including one quarantine officer , one nurse and one administrative officer tested positive for covid-19 out of the 3711 passengers and crew members on board . laboratory tests by pcr that prioritize symptomatic or high-risk groups have been conducted . \n\n incidence curves of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases of covid-19 among passengers and crew members of the outbreak unfolding aboard the princess cruises ship are publicly available from the national institute of infectious diseases , japan ( niid ) website . daily time series of symptomatic patients , from january 20 , 2020 to february 18 , 2020 were extracted . however , to reconstruct the trajectory of the epidemic , only 197 cases have dates of symptoms onset are available out of a total of 300 confirmed symptomatic cases . \n\n of the 103 symptomatic cases with missing onset dates , a total of the 79 cases are passengers while 24 cases are crew members . moreover , out of the 79 passenger cases , 30 cases were reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 21 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 28 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . of 24 crew member cases , 1 case was reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 15 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 8 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . \n\n epidemiological modeling \n\n we connected the daily incidence series with a discrete-time integral equation to describe the epidemic dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . specifically , let fs denote the probability mass function of the serial interval of covid-19 , where the serial interval is defined as the time from illness onset in the primary case to time of illness onset in the secondary case . then fs , of length s days , is given by \n\n for s > 0 , f ( s ) represents the cumulative distribution function of the gamma distribution . we characterized the expected number of new incident cases e [ ci , t ] in type i at symptom onset week t as follows , where rij denotes the average number of cases of type i infected by a single individual of type j . here we assume that the incidence , ci , t , follows a poisson sampling process with expected value e [ ci , t ] . \n\n the reproduction matrix for each type is given by \n\n this matrix is referred to as a next-generation matrix ( ngm ) in a fully susceptible population ( , pp . 873-885 ) . using this matrix , we derive the instantaneous time-dependent effective reproduction number , rt , for the entire transmission dynamics from the largest eigenvalue of the ngm . under the assumption that the per-contact infection probability and the generation interval are consistent over time regardless of the type of infection , the ngm quantifies the within type and inter-type patterns of transmission . the sum of the value in column j is the reproduction number for a specific type j . \n\n serial interval estimates of covid-19 were derived from previous studies of covid-19 , indicating that it follows a gamma distribution with the mean and sd at 7.5 and 3.4 days , respectively , based on ref .. the maximum value of the serial interval was fixed at 20 days as the cumulative probability distribution of the gamma distribution up to 20 days reaches 0.991 . \n\n we estimated model parameters and made projections using a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) method in a bayesian framework . point estimates and corresponding 95 % credibility intervals were drawn from the posterior probability distribution . all statistical analyses were conducted in r version 3.5.2

of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 . passenger and crew also have total ( within-type and inter-type ) rt values largely below the epidemic threshold , with only small percentages at 0 % and 9 % above the epidemic threshold , respectively ( table 3 ) . \n\n discussion \n\n this is the first study to assess the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak that unfolded aboard the diamond princess ship , january-february 2020 . the overall mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore in the range 1.1-7 . however , following the implementation of the quarantine period , the overall rt decreased substantially compared to values estimated during the early stage , but it exhibited fluctuations around the epidemic threshold , which likely prolonged the outbreak . \n\n our results indicate that rt declined following the quarantine measures implemented by the japanese government on february 5 relative to values during the early phase of the outbreak . importantly , only those passengers and crew who tested positive for the novel coronavirus were permitted to disembark the diamond princess ship , with more than 80 percentage of the passengers and crews still on board as of february 18 , 2020 . our latest overall estimate of rt at 0.35 ( 95 % cri : 0.02 , 2.19 ) with only 2 % of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 suggested a low probability of observing a subsequent outbreak aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n our findings indicate that the passenger-to-passenger transmission type dominated the transmission dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . the rapid increase in the overall rt from day 12 ( january 31 , 2020 ) to day 19 ( february 7 , 2020 ) is greatly influenced by the increase in passenger-to-passenger transmission , and this time period covers the time lag between february 1 , 2020 when the index covid-19 case was reported and february 5 , 2020 when the japanese government requested the passengers to stay inside their cabin after the detection of a cluster of covid-19 positive cases . upon the implementation of the quarantine orders , the overall rt and rt for passengers aboard the diamond princess ship declined thereafter , while rt among crew maintained a steady level and only started to decline on day 25 of the outbreak ( february 13 , 2020 ) . this is consistent with the fact that passengers staying inside their cabins led to a substantial decline in passenger-to-passenger transmission type except for their interaction with cabin mates . indeed , the proportion of secondary infections inside the cabins increased from 7 % ( 1/15 ) on february 6 , 43 % ( 3/7 ) on february 10 , 2020 to 100 % ( 1/1 ) on february 14 , 2020 . thus , a high proportion of the symptomatic cases after the quarantine gradually shifted from largely passenger cases to crew cases . indeed , despite their potential risk of acquiring the infection , crews had to continue to work to deliver services to isolated passengers . the distribution of the median re by transmission type suggests that other transmission types likely contributed to this outbreak to some extent ( fig . 3 ) . because one quarantine officer , one nurse , and one administrative officer contracted covid-19 aboard the diamond princess ship , the infection risk continued to be significant inside the diamond princess ship . \n\n as for the crude asymptomatic ratios by age groups , they show significant differences across age groups . however , these crude ratios are severely influenced by the timing of specimen collection relative to the infection time . hence , these ratios could be better ascertained if additional data with the timing of specimen collection becomes available . \n\n several limitations should be listed . first , a total of 103 laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases with unknown onset dates were not incorporated in our analysis . although the high proportion of unavailable data ( 34 % ( 103/300 ) ) likely influenced a downward bias in estimates of transmission potential , our estimates still point to the high transmission potential of covid-19 inside confined settings . second , it is possible that reporting delays could have influenced our latest estimates of the effective reproduction number . in fact , the us government recently sent a chartered flight to transport the american passengers on board the diamond princess ship , and after the disembarkation process , a total of 14 american passengers tested positive for the disease on february 16 , 2020 . this event also contributes to a downward bias in r although the number of cases does not exceed the peak of the outbreak , further supporting the potent transmissibility of covid-19 in confined settings . \n\n our most recent estimate of the effective reproduction number of the ongoing covid-19 epidemic on board the diamond princess ship was largely below the epidemic threshold of 1.0 , which suggested a very low probability of observing secondary outbreaks of the disease in the diamond princess ship . \n\n funding statement \n\n km acknowledges support from the japan society for the promotion of science kakenhi grant number 18k17368 and from

00001000	contact transmission of covid-19 in south korea : novel investigation techniques for tracing contacts \n\n in the epidemiological investigation of an infectious disease , investigating , classifying , tracking , and managing contacts by identifying the patient 's route are important for preventing further transmission of the disease . however , omissions and errors in previous activities can occur when the investigation is performed through only a proxy interview with the patient . to overcome these limitations , methods that can objectively verify the patient 's claims ( medical facility records , global positioning system , card transactions , and closed-circuit television ) were used for the recent ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 contact investigations in south korea . \n\n introduction \n\n an epidemiological investigation aims to quickly determine the prevalence of an infectious disease whilst simultaneously revealing the cause , and source of the disease , and explore the transmission process to ultimately prevent the spread of the infectious disease . as individuals become the source of the infectious disease , and if person-to-person transmission is suspected , it is important to immediately identify , and manage people that are in close contact with suspected patients . in particular , if there are several unknown epidemiological and clinical characteristics , and an effective medical intervention is lacking ( as in the case of new infectious diseases such as covid-19 ) , contact management becomes 1 of the core strategies to minimize additional transmission . for these strategies to be successful , it is necessary to evaluate between-person exposure risk in all locations where there have been confirmed cases ( after the onset of symptoms ) , and to classify contact persons based on this risk . furthermore , it is also important to eliminate the possibility of exposure to infection in the places visited by the confirmed patient , by performing the appropriate disinfection of areas that can harbor environmental contamination . however , traditional investigative methods , depending on the patient or proxy interview , has the limitation of omissions and errors of previous activities . \n\n the covid-19 outbreak in china occurred on december 8th , 2019 , and the first case in korea was reported on january 20th , 2020 . as of february 14th , the total number of confirmed cases of covid-19 in korea was 28 . in the current epidemiological investigation contact investigation techniques that were used on a limited basis for the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) outbreak in 2015 , are being used in all confirmed cases of covid-19 . \n\n this report will provide a general overview of the contact investigation from the covid-19 national emergency response center , epidemiology and case management team and describe the various methods used to evaluate exposure risk . \n\n results \n\n covid-19 contact investigation and management comprised of the following : 1 ) determination of the location of the contact ( patient route ) , 2 ) exposure risk evaluation , 3 ) contact classification , and 4 ) contact management . the location of the contact was determined through the process of preliminary identification , by interviewing patients , and their acquaintances , and by objective verification of the investigated information . exposure risk evaluation was performed depending on the route of disease transmission , patient characteristics , and environmental characteristics . based on the results of the evaluation , the contacts were classified into close and casual contacts depending on the exposure . the method of managing the classified contacts was largely distinguished between movement restriction and symptom monitoring . movement restriction is a legal public health order , and quarantine ( isolation ) , home isolation , or controlled travel is enacted . symptom monitoring was performed as either active or passive monitoring , depending on the exposure risk ( figure 1 ) . \n\n the methods used to overcome recall and confirmation biases that can occur while determining the location of the contact include checking medical facilities records , phone-based global positioning system ( gps ) , card transaction records , and closed-circuit television ( cctv ; table 1 ) . \n\n 1 . history of using medical facilities and visiting pharmacies \n\n history of using medical facilities , and visiting pharmacies was used to estimate the window of time of infection , through an accurate evaluation of the clinical symptoms of the infectious disease , and initial onset of the symptoms . if a medical facility was included in the patient 's route , quarantine of the medical facility was conducted . \n\n 2 . gps \n\n consistency in the recall of the route of the patients identified through interview was evaluated . additionally , identification of the routes that the patient could not remember was also possible . however , another person 's information can be misunderstood as the patient 's information if the phone is not owned by or carried by the patient . gps uses cellular phone networks , therefore there are limitations in identifying the exact locations of a patient 's route . \n\n 3. credit card transaction log \n\n credit card transaction logs were used to assess the consistency in the route of the patient identified through interview , and the scope of contacts was assessed by specifying the locations visited . however , if the patient did not use a credit card under their name or if another person used the patient 's card , the information may be misinterpreted . thus , rechecking the contents of the credit card log was necessary , and instances of not being able to use the information at the appropriate time may occur . \n\n 4 . cctv \n\n by checking the video footage of the location of a patient 's path , cctv provided help to identify the details of each situation . for example , cctv was used to evaluate the level of exposure risk by identifying whether the patient wore masks , or had respiratory symptoms such as a cough . the limitations of using cctv were the lengthy time required to check the cctv , and the accuracy of patient identification if the cctv was not inside the facility or the patient was in a blind spot of the camera . \n\n discussion \n\n based on the experience of the mers outbreak in 2015 , laws were revised to supplement the areas that were lacking at the time . korea centers for disease control and prevention were able to use relevant information in epidemiological investigations to contain and prevent infection , thus enabling the establishment of a more comprehensive management of infectious diseases . furthermore , making accurate information available to the general public helps to minimize fear and confusion with respect to the risk of transmissibility of the disease . the use of methods that have objectively verified the patient 's route claims ( medical facility records , gps , card transactions , and cctv ) for covid-19 contact investigations in south korea has provided accurate information on the location , and time of exposure , and details of the situation , thus reducing omissions in a patient 's route due to recall or confirmation bias that may have arisen from patient or proxy interviews . \n\n however , the publicization of a patient 's route for the public 's benefit infringes upon the privacy of the patient . thus , it is necessary to establish a protocol to protect privacy . equally , more effort should be taken to provide accurate information to the public . patient information that is unrelated to the communication of risk of infectious diseases must be protected by clearly defining the standards of publicization and reporting of patient information for the public 's benefit when an infectious disease is prevalent . \n\n with regards to responding to the recent prevalence of covid-19 , korea centers for disease control and prevention are performing defense activities to contain and prevent infection at the appropriate time , with more objective and accurate methods for monitoring patient contacts by using personal information . however , an evaluation of the effectiveness of these monitoring methods when multiple patients are involved , is necessary after the situation has been controlled . epidemiological investigations require the collaboration of various related persons and must be conducted through a strict verification process . furthermore , investigations must be performed using systematic processes with scientific methods and principles , and cycles of continuous evaluation and feedback to identify the etiology , extent , progression and therapy for the infectious disease and the development of public health policies . \n\n conflicts of interest \n\n the authors declare no competing

00001000	strategic planning to augment the testing capacity for covid-19 in india . \n\n background & objectives : nearly 5,500 tests for coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) had been conducted on march 31 , 2020 across the indian council of medical research ( icmr ) -approved public and private laboratories in india . given the need to rapidly increase testing coverage , we undertook an exercise to explore and quantify interventions to increase the daily real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qrt-pcr ) -based testing capacity over the next few months . the objective of this exercise was to prepare a potential plan to scale-up covid-19 testing in india in the public sector . methods : potential increase in daily testing capacity of the existing public laboratories was calculated across the three base scenarios of shifts ( 9 , 16 and 24 h ) . additional testing capacity was added for each shift scenario based on interventions ranging from procurement of additional qrt-pcr machines , leveraging spare capacity on available qrt-pcr machines not drafted into covid-19 testing , to in-laboratory process optimization efforts . results : moving to a 24 h working model in the existing approved laboratories can enhance the daily testing capacity to 40,464 tests/day . the capacity can be further bolstered by leveraging qrt-pcr and nucleic acid amplification test ( naat ) -based machines available with the multidisciplinary research units ( mrus ) , national aids control organisation ( naco ) and national tuberculosis elimination programme ( ntep ) . using combination/multiplex kits , and provision of automated rna extraction platforms at all laboratories could also optimize run time and contribute to capacity increase by 1.5-2 times . interpretation & conclusions : adopting these interventions could help increase public sector 's daily testing capacity to nearly 100,000-120,000 tests/day . it is important to note that utilization of the scaled-up testing capacity will require deployment of additional workforce , procurement of corresponding commodities for testing and scale-up of sample collection and transportation efforts . 
01100000	using integrated computational approaches to identify safe and rapid treatment for sars-cov-2 \n\n abstract \n\n sars-cov-2 is a new generation of coronavirus , which was first determined in wuhan , china , in december 2019 . so far , however , there no effective treatment has been found to stop this new generation of coronavirus but discovering of the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 main protease ( sars-cov-2 mpro ) may facilitate searching for new therapies for sars-cov-2 . the aim was to assess the effectiveness of available fda approved drugs which can construct a covalent bond with cys145 inside binding site sars-cov-2 main protease by using covalent docking screening . we conducted the covdock module mmgbsa module in the schrodinger suite 2020-1 , to examine the covalent bonding utilizing . besides , we submitted the top three drugs to molecular dynamics simulations via gromacs 2018.1 . the covalent docking showed that saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir and prevacid have the highest binding energies mmgbsa of -72.17 , -72.02 , -65.19 , -57.65 , -54.25 , -51.8 , and -51.14 kcal/mol , respectively . the 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation was conducted for saquinavir , ritonavir and remdesivir to evaluate the stability of these drugs inside the binding pocket of sars-cov-2 main protease . the current study provides a powerful in silico results , means for rapid screening of drugs as anti-protease medications and recommend that the above-mentioned drugs can be used in the treatment of sars-cov-2 in combined or sole therapy . \n\n communicated by ramaswamy h. sarma \n\n introduction \n\n sars-cov-2 also called 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ' abbreviated sars-cov-2 was recognized to be the causative of atypical pneumonia ( joshi , ; pant et al. , ) outbreak in wuhan , china ( hasan , ; s. a. khan et al. , 2020 ) . the virus belongs to the family known as 'coronaviruses ' because of the crown-like appearance of spikes glycoproteins on the envelope under an electron microscope ( y chen et al. , ) . world health organization ( who ) recently announced that the virus transforms from epidemic to pandemic , which requires urgent intervention to prevent the growing spread of the virus across the globe ( chan et al. , ) . the total confirmed cases 2,347,884 with 738,923 cases in the united state of america ( usa ) alone and the total death of 161,138 ( as of april 19 ) , with mortality estimated within 2 % and about 3.4 % , according to estimates of approved cases and death worldwide ( n. chen et al. , ) . the most familiar is a virus that arose from the rhinolophus bat which is > 96 % homologous with the modern sars-cov-2 virus and it is just 79 % homologous with the initial sars-cov ( fisher & heymann , ) . the fast-growing number of infected cases globally urged the world health organization to announce a state of global health emergency to correlate scientific and medical disciplines to develop rapidly an effective treatment for patients , ( morse et al. , ; sarma et al. , ) elderly patients and people with severe underlying health diseases like heart diseases , lung illness , and diabetic patients , for instance , appear to be at greater risk of revealing severe sars-cov-2 requires immediate intervention rather than waiting virus vaccine which may require 1 year to be available ( enayatkhani , ) . while drug repurposing could be a short-term and fast resolution to handle sars-cov-2 patients ( elfiky , ; r. j. khan et al. , 2020 ; kumar et al. , ) , repurposing existing drugs can offer a good choice to overcome the virus and offer better risk-versus trade-off as compared with discovering new drug and can help overcome time waiting for new therapy rather than use the available resources ( elmezayen , ; muralidharan , ) one successful repurposing drug story includes duloxetine which originally developed for depression and fda approved as the first-in-class choice for stress urinary incontinence ( sweeney & chancellor , ) , duloxetine initially created as antidepressant also is now passed to phase iii clinical trials as a first-in-class treatment for premature ejaculation ( mcmahon , ) and thalidomide , which had a tragic start as an over-the-counter sedative for morning sickness in pregnancy is now being applied to manage leprosy and multiple myeloma ( hideshima & anderson , ) . \n\n as a result of , a newly issued x-ray crystal of sars-cov-2 main protein ( mpro ) , we planning to use computational approaches ( cameron et al. , 2013 ) to contribute to find an effective treatment for sars-cov-2.thereby , computational analyses speed up these approaches since they allow to handle millions of data simultaneously ( gupta et al. , 2020 ) . molecular docking includes a set of computational methods and algorithms that aimed to identify novel relationships between chemical ligands and targets through using the modelling of their direct physical interaction ( aanouz , ; ekins et al. , ) . in present study , we attend to evaluate some of approved drugs to be as covalent binders , irreversible interactions , which can provide a powerful strategy to fight against epidemic viruses . and molecular dynamics simulations can give a more detail for the image which got from molecular covalent docking . \n\n materials and methods \n\n covalent virtual screening \n\n the crystal structure of fda-available covalent drugs which available in table 1 were selected based on the review of kumalo et al . and some of the antiviral drugs that can form a covalent bond to the target protein . and we aim also here to redirect them for other indications specially to see their possibility to fight against sars-cov-2 . thence , we searched about the chosen drugs in pubchem ( https : //pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) to identify the possibility of the selected drugs to be as covalent binders toward sars-cov-2 mpro . where , pubchem provides detailed information about the selected drugs rather than other repositories , especially , the property of drug to form covalent bond . before starting covalent docking , we downloaded the selected drugs one by one and optimize them by using the ligprep ( lim et al. , ) based on the opls_2005 force field and generated possible state employing epik in the schrodinger 2020 ( elfiky ; s. a. khan et al.,2020 ) . in the next step , the structure of sars-cov-2 mpro ( 6lu7 ) was downloaded from protein data bank ( http : //www.rcsb.org/pdb ) ( jin et al . , ) . the protease structure was optimized by adding hydrogens , removing water molecules and optimizing charge using the protein preparation wizard module ( kumalo et al. , ) in schrodinger suite 2020-1 . the covalent docking protocol was preferred since the cysteine 145 residue which is available in the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro considered as a vital residue that can form a covalent bond with the drug if it can interact covalently . the different mechanisms for the cys145-fda drug were mentioned in table 1 based on the nature of the drug so that the reactive functional group on the ligand and receptor residue are identified and the bond is formed between the correct atoms . these covalently docked complexes were created using covdock in schrodinger suite 2020-1 . finally , we selected the lowest the mmgbsa value for each drug as a propriate conformation of the drug inside the binding pocket . \n\n entry name pubchem id molecular

docking results showing type of based reaction for constructing covalent bond , docking score , glide score and rmsd . \n\n prime mm-gbsa \n\n the chosen drugs binding energies were calculated using prime mm-gbsa modules ( vijayakumar et al. , ) in the schrodinger ( 2020 ) . the best poses of selected drugs : sars-cov-2 mpro : were chosen to obtain the binding free energy calculation . prime mmgbsa is a method that combines optimized potential for liquid simulations-all atoms ( oplsaa ) force field , molecular mechanics energies ( emm ) , an sgb solvation model for polar solvation ( gsgb ) , and a non-polar solvation term ( gnp ) composed of the non-polar solvent accessible surface area and van der waals interactions . the total binding free energy : delta gbind = gcomplex - ( g-protein + gligand ) . \n\n molecular dynamics simulation \n\n molecular dynamics simulations are a decision-making process for inspections of protein-drug complexes ' stabilities ( al-khafaji & taskin tok , ) . it is used to clarify the dynamic behavior at an atomic level of biological systems , which is hard to handle in labs ( shukla et al. , ) . in the current study , we conducted molecular dynamics simulations for the top three drugs based on mmgbsa values . the got protein-drug complex structures from covalent docking were submitted to md simulations ( saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir with sars-cov-2 mpro ) . we hired gromacs 2018.1 to run 50 ns md simulations ( abraham et al. , ) . charmm 27 force field for all atoms were chosen to run md simulation ( bjelkmar et al. , ) . we used swiss param to produce the topologies of drugs ( zoete et al. , ) . all protein-drug systems were solvated with three-point transferable intermolecular potential ( tip3p ) and their charges were neutralized via adding na or cl ions . in the following step , the protein-drugs systems were energetically minimized through the steepest descent algorithm at a tolerance value of 1000 kj/mol.nm . then the equilibration with position restraint on the protein molecules for 0.1 ns using nvt and npt ensembles were done . electrostatic interactions were evaluated by particle mesh ewald summation ( darden et al. , ) . we performed the molecular dynamics simulation with no restraint on the protein molecules or ligand to determine the stability in the final step ( time step of 0.015 ns ) . rmsd , rmsf , rg , and number of hydrogen bonds were chosen to analyze md trajectories by using gromacs utilities . \n\n principal component analysis \n\n the principal component analysis ( pca ) approach was employed to calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues and their projection along with the first two principal components ( al-khafaji & taskin tok , ) . this approach is based on the protocol of gromacs 2018.1 ( abraham et al. , ) . it is used to simplify the effect of drugs on the dynamic motion of the targeted protein where it extracts the dynamic motions in simulations that are required for their biological function ( amadei et al. , ) . we got the principal component analysis from the md trajectories . a series of eigenvectors and eigenvalues were generated by diagonalizing the matrix . we chose trajectories of the protein backbone of the complexes to get 2 d-projection of motion of trajectory . \n\n results \n\n to assess the possibility of selected fda drugs to work as treatment of sars-cov-2 , the covalent docking was utilized to screen the selected library and rank them according to their binding affinities . the calculated binding free energies of some available drugs using docking score , glide gscore , and ensemble-average mm/gbsa are shown in table 1 . \n\n to validate our covalent docking results , the correlation between mmgbsa and docking score was constructed ( figure 1 ) . the binding energy mmgbsa-docking score correlation shows a good correlation ( r2 = 0.6299 ) . based on this correlation , we chose the top three ranked-mmgbsa and docking score values of fda drugs for dissection their binding modes inside the binding site . covalent docking showed that saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir , and prevacid have -72.17 , -72.02 , -65.19 , -57.65 , -54.25 , -51.8 , and -51.14 , respectively . where all the top-eight fda drugs show a higher affinity to form a covalent , irreversible bond with cys145 of sars-cov-2 mpro . here we investigated the role of molecular weight upon the affinity of selected drugs to bind covalently to cys145 , whereas 57 % of selected drugs which have molecular weight over than 600 g/mol ( figure 2 ) . and have higher free binding energy mmgbsa than -50 kcal/mol . while the ratio of selected drugs decreased to be 16 % of drugs which can form covalent bonding with over than -50 kcal/mol . surprisingly , none of the selected drugs which have a molecular weight below than 300 g/mol can form a good affinity of binding energy . this indicates that higher molecular weight covalent warheads can form stable and efficient binding energy . \n\n the correlation between mmgbsa binding energies and docking score . \n\n effect of molecular weight upon the mmgbsa binding energy . \n\n docked complex analyses \n\n what stands out in the table 1 is saquinavir has the highest binding affinity ( lowest binding energy mmgbsa of 72.17 kcal/mol ) . therefore , the deep examination of saquinavir is needed . figure 3 shows that saquinavir not only formed covalent bond of 1.81 a with cys145 but also formed five hydrogen bonds inside the pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro . in the second rank ritonavir as presented in table 1 has -72.02 kcal/mol . \n\n covalent docking analysis of saquinavir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n this high affinity resulted from covalent bond between ritonavir and cys145 of 1.82 a ( figure 4 ) through nucleophilic addition to double bond reaction besides it interacted within binding site by forming three hydrogen bonds . despite remdesivir formed covalent bond with cys145 of 1.82 a and three hydrogen bonds ( figure 5 ) and this is similar to ritonavir , but the mmgbsa value is lower than that of ritonavir this may due to nature of reaction which in remdesivir nucleophilic addition to triple bond . \n\n covalent docking analysis of ritonavir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n covalent docking analysis of remdesivir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n molecular dynamic simulation \n\n the effect of drug-protein interactions upon dynamics of biological system is a fundamental in drug discovery thereby we used rmsd to investigate the influence of saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir upon the stability of sars-cov-2 mpro . we utilized gromacs to execute the md simulations of 50 ns for three drug-protein systems besides of apo protein . rmsd fluctuations for both apo and hollo forms were measured and presented . the rmsd was calculated to assess the overall dynamics , stability , and convergence of the various systems and the results are presented in figure 6 ( a ) . \n\n analysis of rmsd , rmsf , rg and hydrogen bonding of saquinvir-sars-cov-2 mpro , ritonavir- sars-cov-2 mpro and remdesivir- sars-cov-2 mpro . ( a ) the protein 's backbone rmsd values with respect to time . ( b ) rmsf of the protein 's backbone with respect to position of residue in the protein . ( c ) rg of the protein backbone over the entire time of md simulation . ( d ) the number of hydrogen bonds through all the time of md simulation . \n\n figure 6 ( a ) shows there is a significant decrease in the rmsd value when sars-cov-2 main protease whether it bound to saquinavir , ritonavir , or remedisivir . further analysis revealed that the rmsd average of apo sars-cov-2 main protease was 0.294 nm but when it bound to saquinavir , ritonavir , and remedisivir the rmsd averages were.01865 , 0.2130 , and 0.2053 nm , respectively . another significant aspect of md simulation is the flexibility of protein 's backbone which can be assessed through measuring rmsf value . the results of the comparative analysis between these drugs and their effects upon sars-cov-2 main protease are illustrated in figure 6 ( b ) . closer scrutiny of figure 6 ( b ) exhibits the binding of saquinavir diminished the fluctuations of the protein 's backbone . and behavior is also can be seen from figure 6 ( b ) where the binding of both ritonavir and remedisivir led to reducing the flexibility of the protein . the radius of gyration ( rg ) is a definition of system 's density , and substantially influences the folding rate and stability of proteins . rg was employed to assess the compactness of all complexes . in this work , rg values are in agreement with rmsf values where there are no significant differences between apo form and hollo forms as presented in figure 6 ( c ) . this reveals that protein remained stable and compact all through the 50 ns time . the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds is a vital aspect to give an impression about the stability of drug and protein . also , the number of hydrogen bonds is relevant to the binding scores of molecular docking process . we calculated the hydrogen bonds over time to validate the stable interactions between top three drugs and their corresponding target . as seen in the figure 6 ( d ) the ritonavir has highest order of hydrogen bonding ( the average =3.35 ) , while saquinavir has an average of 1.68 . \n\n principle component analysis ( pca ) \n\n the essential dynamic method is a tool to explore the dynamical behavior in the space of sars-cov-2 main protease combined with saquinavir , ritonavir , and remedisivir . basically , the comparison of the drug-bound sars-cov-2 mpro and drug-unbound was made as reference . in order to further understand the configurational space , we selected the first two principal components ( pc1 , pc2 ) to analyze their projection of trajectories during the simulations of ligand free and ligand bound sars-cov-2 mpro of the phase space ( shown in figure 7 ) . during the four system simulations , the results clearly show that the unbound ligand protein covered a wider region of phase space , while all three drug-protein system occupied a smaller region of phase space . especially , saquinavir reduced the essential dynamics to lowest degree of functional motions as compared with another drugs . moreover , the pca results suggest that the drug-bound sars-cov-2 mpro is more stable than ligand-unbound sars-cov-2 mpro form of sars-cov-2 mpro . in short , the pca results are also in agreement with the rmsd and rmsf results , which enhance the validity of the performed analysis . \n\n two-dimensional projection of motion of trajectory of sars-cov-2 mpro bound with drugs over the pc1 and pc2 . \n\n discussion \n\n sars-cov-2 causes major pandemic health issue since its spread across the world and can infect humans mainly respiratory system causing severe pneumonia with no vaccine and drug treatment available . prior study that have referred to the significance of molecular docking to determine effective treatment in short time ( wu , et al. , ) . in reviewing the literature , we took the advantage of possibility of fda available drugs that can be as a covalent warhead to inhibit the sars-cov-2 mpro with cys145 . an initial objective of the project was to identify effective and applicable treatment . the present study focused on the main protease ( mpro ) , especially pdb id ( 6lu7 ) as a potential target for several marketed drugs as possible therapeutic option to combat the virus to see the capability of these drugs to bind with the cysteine 145 residue which is available in the binding site of sars-cov-2 main protease . the mpro in sars-cov-2 is necessary for the proteolytic maturation of the virus targeting this protein to limit the expansion of infection by hindering the cleavage of the viral polyprotein . the most interesting finding was that the both saquinavir and ritonavir have the same affinity ( binding energy mmgbsa -72 kcal/mol ) to block binding site of sars-cov-2 with irreversible interactions . this study supports evidence from previous observations that lopinavir/ritonavir can inhibit sars-cov-2 ( lim et al. , ) . another important outcome was that the remdesivir comes in second rank with binding affinity ( mmgbsa = -65 kcal/mol ) . whereas previous research has established that remdesivir can inhibit sars-cov-2 m proenzyme through docking results . another significant finding , delavirdine computationally showed the ability to form irreversible covalent bond of -57.65 kcal/mol mmgbsa binding energy . moreover , indinavir and cefuroxime axetil exhibited the possibility to halt the pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro by forming stable interaction through covalent bonding and hydrogen bonding ( mmgbsa binding energies -54 kcal/mol ) . furthermore , oseltamivir and prevacid exhibited same affinity to bind with sars-cov-2 protease through one covalent bond and one hydrogen bond ( -51 kcal/mol ) , which is a good explanation for the activity of oseltamivir ( peeri et al. , ) . in this study , results obtained show the binding affinity of drugs to an active site depends on several factors mainly the ability of a compound to form a covalent bond with amino acid residues of the mpro ( cys145 ) and length of a covalent bond , the number of h-bonds that can form with a pocket of the active site and type of nucleophilic addition of unsaturated bonds . in this concept , the structural features in saquinavir and ritonavir like free amine group ( -nh2 ) , hydroxyl groups ( -oh ) , carbonyl groups ( c=o ) in addition to ether group play key structural feature to form h-bond . results show the promising activities for antiretroviral drugs saquinavir that used for hiv/aids more than ritonavir and remdesivir followed by lopinavir as the best drugs to bind covalently toward sars-cov-2 mpro with lowest energy of binding . as discussed above , saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir , and prevacid showed the ability to block the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro by forming covalent bond and stabilized with hydrogen bonding . \n\n these outcomes are contrary to that of kandeel and al-nazawi ( 2020 ) , they found that ribavirin , telbivudine , vitamin b12 , and nicotinamide can be can form non-bonding interactions . whilst our results showed that , saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir can form irreversible interactions , which are considered an effective way for viral infections . \n\n in the present work , comparative molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir on the conformational and dynamical demeanor in either apo or hollo forms to understand the inhibitory possibility at atomic level . an initial mission of the project was to identify rapid , effective , safe , and available for large proportions of people , so we run covalent docking and mmgbsa to sift the possibility of these drug to form irreversible interactions . therefore , we had chosen these drugs because they carry covalent warheads that can bind covalently to the target . but the docking results are not adequate , so we run md simulations examine how much these drugs are able to form stable interactions with targeted protein . one interesting finding is the rmsd of protein backbone in apo status has higher average value , whereas the binding with top three drugs diminished these rmsd average . another important finding was that the rmsf of protein 's backbone be less flexible when it compared to apo form of sars-cov-2 main protease . it is somewhat surprising that the binding of three drugs have not noted in rg values . it is not yet clear whether the top three drugs can show an evidence to inhibit the targeted protein , thereby we lean on the principal component analysis to analyze the md trajectories to judge without dispute . the most obvious finding to emerge from 2d pca analysis is that the binding of under investigated drugs caused stately impact on essential dynamics of protein by reducing its essential dynamics to its least possible motions . these results seem to be consistent with rmsd results . a possible explanation for this might be that binding of the drugs make the binding site much narrower due to hydrogen bindings this makes the 3d structure of targeted protein more rigid so it will lose its biological functions . it is possible , therefore , that using these available drugs in two ways : either alone or in combined way . these findings suggest the possible use of nominated drugs against sars-cov-2 in short time as approved by covalent docking screening . also , the present results are significant in at least directing the clinicians to use these safe drugs to stop development of corona virus and second giving hope that available drugs that can be efficient treatment . \n\n conclusions \n\n coronavirus today emphasizes as a potential threat to all people worldwide . although extensive researches have been directed to stop sars-cov-2 , but till now there is no medication . meanwhile , the spreading with complicated crisis requires immediate therapy to overcome the spread and minimize mortality of sars-cov-2 . the aim of the present study was to discover effective treatment through repurposing some of available fda-approved drugs against sars-cov-2 mpro . where , they can provide covalent warheads in virtual screening . the most prominent finding to emerge from this study is that the affinity of covalent binder toward sars-cov-2 mpro is ranked : saquinavir > ritonavir > remdesivir > delavirdine > cefuroxime axetil > oseltamivir = prevacid . one of the more noteworthy findings in this study is that md simulation analysis that saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir can form stable interaction inside the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro . also , they restricted the essential motions of protein . overall , the results of screening toward mpret encourage for further clinical evaluations . they can be easy to reach and exploit as persuasive treatments for sars-cov-2 . \n\n acknowledgements \n\n authors thankful for staff membered of gaziantep university institute of health sciences , department of bioinformatics and computational biology . \n\n

00001000	strength , weakness , opportunity , threat ( swot ) analysis of the adaptations to anatomical education in the united kingdom and republic of ireland in response to the coivd-19 pandemic . \n\n the covid-19 pandemic has driven the fastest changes to higher education across the globe , necessitated by social distancing measures preventing any face to face teaching . this has led to an almost immediate switch to distance learning by higher education institutions . anatomy faces some unique challenges . intrinsically , anatomy is a three-dimensional subject that requires a sound understanding of the relationships between structures , often achieved by the study of human cadaveric material , models and virtual resources . this study sought to identify the approaches taken in the united kingdom and republic of ireland to deliver anatomical education through online means . data were collected from 14 different universities in the united kingdom and republic of ireland and compared adopting a thematic analysis approach . once themes were generated , they were collectively brought together using a strength , weakness , opportunity , threat ( swot ) analysis . key themes included the opportunity to develop new online resources and the chance to engage in new academic collaborations . academics frequently mentioned the challenge that time constrains could place on the quality and effectiveness of these resources ; especially as in many cases the aim of these resources is to compensate for a lack of exposure to cadaveric exposure . comparisons of the actions taken by multiple higher education institutions reveals the ways that academics have tried to balance this demand . discussions will facilitate decisions being made by higher education institutions regarding adapting the curriculum and assessment methods in anatomy . 
10001000	early trends for sars-cov-2 infection in central and north texas and impact on other circulating respiratory viruses . \n\n introduction : rapid diagnosis and isolation are key to containing the quick spread of a pandemic agent like sars-cov-2 , which has spread globally since its initial outbreak in wuhan province in china . sars-cov-2 is novel and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal viruses is just becoming apparent . we present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of march , 2020 . methods : this is a retrospective cohort study post launching of sars-cov-2 testing at baylor scott and white hospital ( bswh ) , temple , texas . testing for sars-cov-2 was performed by real-time rt-pcr assay and results were shared with state public health officials for immediate interventions . results : more than 3500 tests were performed during the first two weeks of testing for sars-cov-2 and identified 168 ( 4.7 % ) positive patients . sixty-two ( 3.2 % ) of the 1,912 ambulatory patients and 106 ( 6.3 % ) of the 1,659 ed/inpatients tested were positive . the highest rate of infection ( 6.9 % ) was seen in patients aged 25-34 years , while the lowest rate of infection was seen among patients aged < 25 years old ( 2 % ) . county-specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions . incidentally , this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of seasonal respiratory virus infections , perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness about sars-cov-2 among the general public , as well as the social distancing measures implemented in response to sars-cov-2 . data extracted for bswh from the cdc 's national respiratory and enteric virus surveillance system ( nrevss ) site revealed that influenza incidence was 8.7 % in march 2020 , compared to 25 % in march 2019 . conclusions : this study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management . this study provided sars-cov-2 testing data from ambulatory and inpatient population . epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like sars-cov-2 . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved . 
01000000	reverse vaccinology approach to design a novel multi-epitope vaccine candidate against covid-19 : an in silico study \n\n abstract \n\n at present , novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov , the causative agent of covid-19 ) has caused worldwide social and economic disruption . the disturbing statistics of this infection promoted us to develop an effective vaccine candidate against the covid-19 . in this study , bioinformatics approaches were employed to design and introduce a novel multi-epitope vaccine against 2019-ncov that can potentially trigger both cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell immune responses and investigated its biological activities by computational tools . three known antigenic proteins ( nucleocapsid , orf3a , and membrane protein , hereafter called nom ) from the virus were selected and analyzed for prediction of the potential immunogenic b and t-cell epitopes and then validated using bioinformatics tools . based on in silico analysis , we have constructed a multi-epitope vaccine candidate ( nom ) with five rich-epitopes domain including highly scored t and b-cell epitopes . after predicting and evaluating of the third structure of the protein candidate , the best 3 d predicted model was applied for docking studies with toll-like receptor 4 ( tlr4 ) and hla-a * 11:01 . in the next step , molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation was used to evaluate the stability of the designed fusion protein with tlr4 and hla-a * 11:01 receptors . md studies demonstrated that the nom-tlr4 and nom-hla-a * 11:01 docked models were stable during simulation time . in silico evaluation showed that the designed chimeric protein could simultaneously elicit humoral and cell-mediated immune responses . \n\n communicated by ramaswamy h. sarma \n\n introduction \n\n coronavirus disease covid-19 outbreak began in late december 2019 in wuhan , the capital of hubei province , china ( wang et al. , ) . scientists from all over the world are attempting to investigate this novel virus , known as 2019-ncov , which is highly contagious , and to discover effective interventions to control and prevent the disease ( heymann , ; huang et al. , ) . coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses ( ssrna+ ) belonging to the coronaviridae family . human coronaviruses hcov-229e , hcov-nl63 , hcov-oc43 , and hcov-hku1 are observed in almost one-third of the common cold ( lim et al. , ) . however , recently some cases of human coronavirus infections have led to fatal endemics , including sars ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) , mers ( middle east respiratory syndrome ) and covid-19 that are common diseases between humans and animals whose belong to the genus betacoronavirus of the coronaviridae family ( al-tawfiq et al. , ) . so far , the novel covid-19 has caused more than 700,000 illnesses and more than 33,000 deaths worldwide ( w.h.o. , 2020 ) . the genome size of this virus is about 30 kb and encodes structural and non-structural proteins like other coronaviruses . structural proteins include s protein ( spike ) , e protein ( envelope ) , m protein ( membrane ) , and n protein ( nucleocapsid ) ( ahmed et al. , ) . the increasing rate of covid-19 disease and the high morbidity necessitate the development of a specific and safe vaccine candidate as soon as possible . there is very little known actually about the pathogenesis of the virus ; therefore , an immunoinformatics-based approach to investigate the immunogenic epitopes and vaccine design using data from proteins sequencing of the covid-19 is required . \n\n n protein is the only structural protein that associates with replicase-transcriptase complexes and binds with genomic rna in coronaviruses ( cong et al. , ) . this protein is multifunctional and one of the most crucial structural components of coronaviruses . n protein is a structural and antigenic protein that is involved in packaging , transcription , and replication coronaviruses ( 4 ) . this data showed that n protein is a suitable candidate for targeting drug and vaccine design because this protein is conserved , antigenic and multifunctional ( 6 ) . leung and et al . concluded that n protein can be a suitable vaccine candidate against sars-cov because induce strong antibody and this process may trigger cytokine production ( leung et al. , ) . coronaviruses m protein also has a key role in the assembly of virions . the sars-cov m protein can interact with n protein and make a network of interactions with the genomic rna ( he et al. , ) . ong and et al . the covid-19 antigens such as s , n and m proteins introduced as a vaccine candidate ( 6 ) . this protein has also been studied as an epitope vaccine candidate against sars-cov ( 7 ) . \n\n open reading frame 3a ( orf3a ) is required for viral replication and virulence of sars cov . severe induction of proinflammatory cytokine is a sign of sars-cov and mers-cov infections . orf3a activates both pro-il-1beta gene expression and il-1beta secretion and leads to severe lung injury . ( siu et al. , ) . also , orf3a has an important role in sars-cov assembly or budding with the participation of m and e proteins ( mcbride & fielding , ) . these proteins are not only involved in the pathogenesis of the covid-19 virus but also have high antigenicity ( chan et al. , ; siu et al. , ; xu et al. , ) . in this study e , m , n , orf10 , orf8 , orf3a and m proteins were evaluated by available bioinformatics tools for designing an efficient multi-epitope vaccine for the stimulation of immune responses against covid-19 infection . \n\n since the covid-19 has been recently discovered , little immunological information is available . preliminary studies based on phylogenetic analyses of the covid-19 whole genome have suggested that this virus is very similar to the sars-cov ( 79.7 % identify ) ( 9 , 14 ) . given the apparent similarity between the two viruses , it could be concluded that previous studies on the protective immune responses against sars-cov may be useful for developing a vaccine for covid-19 . previous studies have suggested that both humoral and cellular immunity play important roles in protective responses against this virus ( deming et al. , ; yang et al. , ) . studies revealed that the formation of antibodies against the n protein of sars-cov , an immunogenic protein that is highly expressed during infection , is relatively common in patients infected with this virus ( liu et al. , ; lin et al. , ) . although these antibodies are effective , they have a shorter lifespan in recovering the patients . in addition to the specific humoral immunity , it has been shown that the cd4+ and cd8+ responses provide long-lasting protection against covid-19 . these studies showed that besides antibody-mediated immune response , cellular immunity is critical to induce protectivity in these infections ( liu et al. , ) . the concept of a multi-epitope vaccine is to efficiently identify and assemble b and t-cell epitopes that are more capable of stimulating the immune system and therefore can induce more potent and effective both arms of immune responses . peptides and epitopes have shown to be desirable candidates for vaccine development due to their relatively easy production , chemical stability , and lack of infectious potential ( patronov & doytchinova , ) . the experimental design and production of multi-epitope vaccines have improved dramatically in recent years . these vaccines are mainly made up of b-cell , cd8+ cytolytic t-cell ( ctls ) and cd4+ helper t-cells ( htls ) epitopes ( chiarella et al. , ) . since the antigenic epitopes of a protein could be predicted and detected , therefore the whole protein is not suitable to stimulate an immune response ( testa & philip , ; zheng et al. , ) . during the development of a vaccine candidate against covid-19 , complex pathogenic mechanisms and numerous pathogenic factors should be considered in vaccine formulation . \n\n in the present study , we aimed to design a novel multi-epitope fusion protein ( nucleocapsid , orf3a , and membrane protein or nom ) containing more efficient antigenic epitopes-rich domains . the biological activity of the engineered fusion protein was assessed by bioinformatics tools using the interaction between the vaccine candidate and the innate immune system receptor ( tlr4 ) and cellular immune system receptor ( hla-a * 11:01 ) . we strongly believe that the outcome of the present report will provide a potential vaccine candidate against 2019-ncov . \n\n materials and methods \n\n in this study , we designed a suitable vaccine candidate against covid-19 , by exploiting the programs of reverse vaccinology ( figure 1 ) \n\n strategies employed in the overall study . \n\n retrieval of protein sequences \n\n at first , the amino acid sequences of proteins were retrieved from the national centre for biotechnology information ( ncbi ) at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov in fasta format and performed for subsequent analysis ( table 1 ) . \n\n name protein accession number fasta nucleocapsid protein qic53221.1 > qic53221.1 nucleocapsid protein [ severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ] [ severe acute

selected six proteins of covid-19 virus ( table 1 ) that have an essential role in virulence and replication of the virus , and previous studies have highlighted the necessity of these proteins in coronaviruses function . after the antigenic analysis of these proteins , three proteins of n , orf3a , and m were selected for final analysis . \n\n prediction of t-cell ( hla class i and ii ) epitopes \n\n 1d sequence-based screening server rankpep was used to identify t-cell epitopes ( reche & reinherz , ) . this server predicts peptide binders to mhc molecules from protein sequences using the position-specific scoring matrix ( pssm ) . we have selected all hla class i alleles from the selection panel of rankpep server for prediction of epitopes of hla class i . to prediction of epitopes of hla class ii , we considered drb1 * 0101 , drb1 * 0301 , drb1 * 0401 , drb1 * 0701 , drb1 * 0801 , drb1 * 1101 , drb1 * 1301 , and drb1 * 1501 that cover hla variability of over 95 % of the human population worldwide ( kruiswijk et al. , ) . \n\n b-cell epitopes ( linear ) identification \n\n for the prediction of b-cell epitopes , the amino acid sequence was analyzed using bepipred and kolaskar & tongaonkar antigenicity ( http : //www.iedb.org/ ) servers ( vita et al. , ) . bepipred for linear epitope prediction uses both hidden markov model and amino acid propensity scales methods . kolaskar and tongaonkar evaluate the protein for b cell epitopes using the physicochemical properties of the amino acids and their frequencies of occurrence in recognized b cell epitopes ( kolaskar & tongaonkar , ; mirza et al. , ) . \n\n selection of epitope-rich domains and the final sequence \n\n according to the prediction results of the servers used , b cell epitopes and hla class i and ii epitopes that have had high scores were extracted and combined to generate multi-epitope protein . b cell and t cell epitope-rich domains of n , orf3a and m proteins were selected and joined to each other with an aaa linker . \n\n antigenicity and allergenicity evaluation \n\n antigenicity of designed recombinant protein predicted using the vaxijen v2.0 server . the vaxijen classified antigens based on auto cross-covariance ( acc ) transformation of protein sequences into uniform vectors of principal amino acid properties which is a novel alignment-independent method and overcome the limitations of alignment-dependent sequence methods ( doytchinova & flower , ) . the prediction of vaccine candidate allergenicity is essential . the allergenicity of the designed protein was computed by allertop ( http : //www.ddg-pharmfac.net/allertop/ ) . allertop method predicts recombinant protein allergenicity on auto cross-covariance acc that describe residue hydrophobicity , size , abundance , helix- and beta-strand forming propensities ( dimitrov et al. , ) . allertop v.2 has the highest accuracy ( 88.7 % ) compared to several servers for allergen prediction ( dimitrov et al. , ) . \n\n the physicochemical parameters \n\n the analyzed parameters consisted of the molecular weight , theoretical pi , amino acid composition , atomic composition , extinction coefficient , estimated half-life , instability index , aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathicity that were evaluated by protparam online server ( http : //us.expasy.org/tools/ protparam.html ) ( gasteiger et al. , ) . \n\n secondary and tertiary structure prediction \n\n gor was used for the designed protein secondary structure prediction ( https : //npsa-prabi.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat.pl ? page=/npsa/npsa_gor4.html ) ( kloczkowski et al. , ) . gor4 predict protein secondary structure using information theory . \n\n the tertiary structure was built using the galaxy web . galaxyweb server ( http : //galaxy.seoklab.org/ tbm ) is based on the tbm method . this server detects similar proteins and alignment with the target sequence , then make the model and finally perform model refinement ( shin et al. , ) . \n\n tertiary structure refinement and validation \n\n the best-modeled structure was refined using the galaxy refine server at ( http : //galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi ? type=refine ) . galaxy refined the model by molecular dynamics simulation . this method showed one of the best performances in improving protein structure quality . \n\n analysis of the final 3 d model was made using molprobity , prosa and ramachandran plot . ramachandran plot obtained from rampage calculates torsional angles residue-by-residue in protein and indicates that residues are in allowed , favored or outlier regions ( oberholser , ) . prosa web used to recognize the errors in the generated 3 d models using atomic coordinates of the model . prosa web was created z-score ( overall model quality ) and a plot of residue energies of proteins ( wiederstein & sippl , ) . clash analysis is very important for the validation of proteins . molprobity is a structure-validation web service that calculates the clash score , protein-geometry score , poor rotamers , ramachandran plot , and molprobity score . \n\n defining discontinuous b-cell epitopes of designed protein \n\n the interaction between antigen epitopes and antibodies is very essential to eliminate the infection . conformational epitopes are the most important and the most prevalent epitopes that are recognized by antibodies . all conformational epitope prediction methods require the 3 d structures of proteins . discontinuous epitopes of recombinant protein predicted using the ellipro server . this web-based predicts discontinuous epitopes based on protein-antibody interactions . ellipro server predicts conformational and linear b cell epitopes using thornton 's method and by modeller program or blast search of pdb predict and visualize of antibody epitopes ( ponomarenko et al. , ) . \n\n obtaining and preparing the structures of immune receptors and nom recombinant protein \n\n the crystallographic structures of tlr4 ( pdb id : 2z62 ( kim et al. , ) ) and hla-a * 11:01 ( pdb id : 5wjl ( culshaw et al. , 2017 ) ) were obtained from the pdb database ( berman et al. , ) . the structures were cleaned and crystallographic waters and co-crystallized molecules were deleted and only the monomer forms of each receptor were kept . then , the structures of the two receptors and the nom protein were prepared by the dock prep tool in ucsf chimera software ( pettersen et al. , ) where hydrogen atoms and charge were added to the structures to make them ready for the next step . in the next step , to stabilize and relax the structures in an aqueous physiological environment , each of the monomer form of the receptors and the nom protein were simulated for 100 ns . the details of the md simulation will be explained later . \n\n protein-protein molecular docking and refinement \n\n after the md simulation of each receptor and the nom recombinant protein , the last frame of the trajectory of each simulation was extracted and used as the input structures for protein-protein molecular docking . the patchdock webserver ( schneidman-duhovny et al. , ) with default parameters was used to predict the best positions and orientations where the two proteins can have the highest number of favorable interactions . afterward , the top 10 solutions were subjected to firedock webserver ( andrusier et al. , ; mashiach et al. , ) to refine the interaction of protein-protein complexes resulted from molecular docking . the top two complexes from coronavirus nom protein-tlr4 and nom recombinant protein-hla-a * 11:01 complexes were chosen based on global energies . these four complexes were then taken to the next step , md simulation . \n\n molecular dynamics simulation \n\n after performing the protein-protein molecular docking and finding the best orientations of the vaccine candidate and the receptor proteins to interact with one another , the two best-scored complexes were subjected to md simulation . all of the md simulations were done by gromacs 2018 package ( abraham et al. , ) and opls-aa force field ( jorgensen et al. , ) . the monomer form of each protein and also the docked complexes were placed in the center of a triclinic box with a distance of 1 nm from all edges and solvated with tip3p water model ( jorgensen et al. , ) . then , sodium and chloride ions were added to produce a neutral physiological salt concentration of 150 mm . each system was energy minimized , using the steepest descent algorithm , until the fmax was found to be smaller than 10 kj.mol-1nm-1 . all of the covalent bonds were constrained using the linear constraint solver ( lincs ) algorithm ( hess et al. , ) to maintain constant bond lengths . the long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh ewald ( pme ) method ( darden et al. , ; essmann et al. , ) and the cut off radii for coulomb and van der waals short-range interactions were set to 0.9 nm . then 100 ps nvt ( constant number of particles ( n ) , volume ( v ) , and temperature ( t ) ) and 300 ps npt ( constant number of particles ( n ) , pressure ( p ) , and temperature ( t ) ) equilibrations were performed for each system . after the necessary equilibrations , 100 ns of production run were performed for each of the four complexes . finally , simulations were carried out under the periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , set at xyz coordinates to ensure that the atoms had stayed inside the simulation box , and the subsequent analyses were then performed using gromacs utilities , vmd ( humphrey et al. , ) and uscf chimera , and also the plots and the figures were created using daniel 's xl toolbox ( v 7.3.2 ) add-in ( kraus , ) and ezmol ( reynolds et al. , ) . all of the computations were performed on an ubuntu desktop pc , with a [ intel ( r ) xeon ( r ) cpu e5-2630 v3 + nvidia geforce gtx 1080 ] configuration . \n\n mmpbsa binding free energy \n\n the binding free energies of the protein-protein complexes were calculated by molecular mechanics-poisson-boltzmann solvent-accessible surface area , mmpbsa method ( kollman et al. , ) using g_mmpbsa package ( kumari et al. , ) . in this method , the binding free energy is the result of the free energy of the complex minus the sum of the free energies of the ligand and the protein . in our case , the nom recombinant protein is defined as the ligand and the immune receptors are defined as the receptors . the mmpbsa calculation was done for every ns of each simulation trajectories . \n\n results and discussion \n\n defining t-cell epitopes \n\n the results of several studies have shown that strong virus-specific t-cell response is required for the elimination of respiratory virus infections such as sars-cov and influenza a and para-influenza . these studies conclude that future vaccine interventions should also consider strategies to enhance t cell response to provide robust long-term memory ( channappanavar et al. , ; janice oh et al. , ) . studies have shown that high levels of t cell responses against n protein were found 2 years after the patient 's recovery ( peng et al. , ) . antibodies are essential to combat sars-cov infection , and the body needs sars-cov specific cd4+ t helper cells to produce these specific antibodies . also , cd8+ cytotoxic t cells are important for recognizing and killing infected cells , especially in the lungs of infected individuals . we used the rankpep server which covers almost all hla supertypes to predicted different epitops from n , orf3a and m proteins sequence according to hla i and hla ii alleles . antigenic epitopes with high binding affinity score were predicted that are summarized in table 2a-b . \n\n antigen hla_a0201 hla_a0204 hla_a0206 hla_b0702 hla_b51 hla_b5401 hla_b5301 nucleocapsid protein 316-324 299-307 66-74 343-351 66-74 45-53 gmsrigmev

such as measles and rubella reflects the importance of protective antibodies . protection against virus infection such as coronaviruses depends on the simulation of neutralizing antibodies in addition to the t cell-mediated immunity . while cytotoxic lymphocytes can kill infected cells , antibodies have the potential to eliminate infected cells and prevent the infectious virus from infecting a cell ( neutralization ) . sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies block viral entry ( dorner & radbruch , ; hsueh et al. , ) . in this study , for the linear epitope prediction , the bepipred server was employed . bepipred analysis revealed several continuous predicted epitopes of n , orf3a and m proteins . for cross-checking the predicted epitopes , the sequence of all three proteins was also predicted by kolaskar & tongaonkar antigenicity . the linear b-cell epitopes are represented in ( table 3 ) . given that both cellular and humoral immune responses are essential against coronaviruses infection ( janice oh et al. , ) , finally , epitopes that were shared between b cell and t-cell were selected . \n\n selected targets for designing the final vaccine \n\n the main strategy in the present study was to design and construct a novel multi-epitope protein from covid-19 based on in silico methods to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses . due to the low immunogenicity of the epitope , we chose epitope-rich domains to generate a more diverse and robust response ( wieser et al. , ) . based on in silico analysis , five epitope-rich domains including highly scored and shared epitopes between t and b-cell epitopes were selected and joined to each other with a three aaa linker ( table 4 ) . the schematic diagram of designed vaccine domains with linker 's sites has been shown in figure 2 . \n\n the schematic diagram of the vaccine candidate construct consists of n , orf3a and m proteins epitopes of the covid-19 linked together with aaa linkers . \n\n antigen server

allergenicity \n\n prediction of the vaccine candidate antigenicity represents a numerical criterion for the capability of the vaccine to bind to the b- and t-cell receptors and increase the immune response in the host cell . vaxijen v2.0 was used to predict the antigenicity of the designed protein . vaxijen analysis of nom protein showed potent antigenicity 0.5999 with a 0.4 % threshold . the results indicate that the designed protein sequences without adjuvant are antigenic . \n\n allergen proteins induce an ige antibody response ( dimitrov et al. , ) . the designed vaccine candidate must not show an allergic reaction to the body . the allergenicity of the sequence was predicted using the allertop tool . based on prediction approaches in allertop , this protein was not recognized as an allergen . \n\n the physicochemical parameters and protein secondary structure prediction \n\n primary structure analysis nom designed protein ( 337 aa ) has a molecular weight of 37513.57 d. the total number of positively charged residues ( arg + lys ) and negatively charged residues ( asp + glu ) were 19 and 32 respectively . the theoretical isoelectric point ( pi ) was calculated at 9.62 . the instability index ( < 40 ) indicates that the designed protein has high stability for the initiation of an immunogenic reaction . the instability index ( ii ) was 35.75 which classifies the protein as stable . the aliphatic index of nom recombinant protein was calculated 97.92 and indicates this protein has stability in several temperatures . \n\n natively unfolded protein regions and alpha-helix are important forms of structural antigens that can be arranged in their native structure and thus identified by antibodies that are produced in response to infection . ( shey et al. , ) . the composition of the predicted secondary structure of the nom multi-epitope vaccine candidate was 43.92 % ( alpha helix ) , 16.02 % ( extended strand ) , and 40.06 % ( random coil ) . all this information indicates the designed protein is suitable as a vaccine candidate . \n\n tertiary structure prediction and validation \n\n three-dimensional structure was modeled by galaxyweb for our designed protein ( figure 3a ) . this model was used for evaluation and refinement . for validation of the model , prosa-web , ramachandran plot and molprobity were used that compare and analyze the protein structure . the prosa web determined z-score for the best predicted 3 d model ( figure 3b ) . the z-score of the nom predicted model was -4.42 , which is within the range of scores typically found for native proteins of similar size . the ramachandran plot indicates that most of the residues are found in the favored and allowed regions ( 99.7 % ) and only 0.3 % in the outlier region , this shows that the quality of the designed model is satisfactory . phe 282 , asn311 , tyr228 , lys194 , asp223 , ser229 , ser4 , his197 , tyr68 residues were observed in the allowed and outlier regions of ramachandran plot ( figure 3c ) . in molprobity analysis , the all-atom clash score was 9.37 , the molprobity score was 2.21 . all structural images were created using pymol ( the pymol molecular graphics system , version 1.1 , schrodinger , llc ) . \n\n ( a-c ) prediction and validation of tertiary structure of the nom recombinant protein using ( a ) prediction of the

b-cell epitopes from the 3 d structure of nom recombinant protein . discontinuous b-cell epitopes were predicted with scores ranging from0.679 to 0.945 . amino acid residues , the number of residues , sequence location as well as their scores have been listed in tables 5 . the graphical representation of the discontinuous epitopes has been displayed in figure 4 . \n\n three-dimensional

conformational b-cell epitopes from vaccine protein using ellipro server . \n\n establishing the stability of the initial structures \n\n a vaccine can interact with different receptors of the immune system . we have docked designed final constructs ( nom ) with tlr4 and hla-a * 11:01 receptors . the interaction between these receptors and nom recombinant protein induce different immune responses . to achieve a stable and relaxed state of the nom recombinant protein and the immune receptors , a md simulation of 100 ns was performed for each structure . these simulations ensure that the structures are stable enough to be used for protein-protein molecular docking . after 100 ns of the production run , as it is shown in figure 5 , the rmsd ( root mean square distance ) values of the monomers show that the backbone structure of tlr4 ( pdb id : 2z62 ) is very rigid and stable . the structure of the nom recombinant protein also reached stability after about 25 ns after a considerable structural change . the backbone structure of the hla-a * 11:01 ( pdb id : 5wjl ) , however , showed big spikes in the rmsd values but all three structures were visually inspected and were considered stable enough for the next step of the project . \n\n the rmsd values of the simulated monomer forms of the proteins throughput the 100 ns of production runs . \n\n protein-protein molecular docking \n\n to find the best orientation for optimal interaction of the nom protein with the immune receptors we decided to use protein-protein molecular docking . we used patchdock webserver which concentrates on recognizing and matching patterns of the surfaces of the proteins to put them in the best possible positions . afterward , the top 10 best solutions were subjected to the firedock webserver to refine the docked structures . the firedock algorithms refine the docked complexes by side-chain rearrangement and soft rigid-body optimization . the ranking of the docked complexes is based on short-range , long-range , attractive and repulsive interaction energies between the residues of the two proteins , which are all summed up in the global energy or the binding energy of the complexes . we considered global energy as the main criterion for choosing the best complexes and chose the two top-scored solutions with the best global energy . as it is shown in table 6 , the solution numbers 5 and 6 from the nom-tlr4 complex and the solution numbers 2 and 3 , from nom-hla-a * 11:01 complex , were chosen for further calculations . the total energy plots of the simulations are shown in figure 6 . the results showed a strong interaction between designed protein amino acids and receptors . the interactions between the binding receptors and the docked nom protein were visualized using the ucsf chimera program . residues of hla-a * 1101 ( glu53 , asn174 , gly56 , asn174 , glu53 , pro57 ) participated in the interaction with arg49 , ser97 , gln91 , met102 , arg49 and gln91 residues of the candidate vaccine . also , nine residues of tlr4 ( tlr4 lys123 , ile319 , thr66 , ser90 , lys124 , lys46 , his85 , lys123 ) participated in the interaction with ser45 , glu199 , gln91 , ala84 , met328 , gln65 , ser90 , glu68 residues of the designed candidate vaccine . \n\n the total energy plots of the simulations . \n\n complex no of solution glob

simulation of top scored solutions \n\n after the protein-protein molecular docking , 4 solutions were chosen for md simulation , solution numbers 2 and 3 from nom protein-hla-a * 11:01 complex and solution numbers 5 and 6 from nom protein-tlr4 complex . each was simulated for 100 ns . to examine their stability throughout the simulations period , the rmsd values of each protein was analyzed . as it is shown in figure 7 , each protein has different rmsd values and in some of them , the backbone atoms have considerable movements during the simulations . the reason is that the interactions can get optimized and rearranged by introducing water molecules and physiological conditions . the rmsd values of tlr4 in nom protein-tlr4 complexes and the values of hla-a * 11:01 in nom protein-hla-a * 11:01 complexes are very stable and the average values do not reach very high values . however , the rmsd values of the nom protein in every complex reach high values which means that the structure of the vaccine has more movements to refine the interactions with the immune receptors . however , the interactions between the nom recombinant protein and the immune receptors are quite strong and mmpbsa binding energy calculations exhibit great binding energies . as it is shown in table 7 , the van der waals and electrostatic energies of the complexes are strong enough to keep the two proteins in contact with each other . moreover , the deviation of each value is very small which means that the interactions are very stable and consistent throughout the simulations . in another word , the higher scale of rmsd values with consistent binding energies only show that the structure of the nom protein is well optimized for interacting with the immune receptors . \n\n the rmsd

cfvlaavyrinwitggiaiamaclvglmwlsyfiasf \n\n five epitope-rich domains were selected \n\n in addition to the analysis described above , to analyze the fluctuations of the backbone atoms of structures of the proteins , we decided to perform rmsf ( root mean square fluctuation ) analysis . in this analysis , the average value of fluctuation of each residue during the simulation is plotted , figure 8 . as it is shown in figure 8a , the rmsf values of nom recombinant protein in five simulations indicate that the fluctuation of the monomer form of the vaccine in many regions is considerably more than the complex forms . this is a direct indication that the nom recombinant protein is much more stable when it is in complex with the two immune receptors . furthermore , the rmsf values of the nom recombinant protein in complex with hla-a * 11:01 are lower compared with that of nom recombinant protein in complex with tlr4 . also , with the evidence that the binding energies are also lower , we can conclude that nom recombinant protein can bind to the hla-a * 11:01 better than the other immune receptor . \n\n the rmsf values of each protein in the simulated complexes compared to the simulated monomer forms of the proteins throughout the 100 ns of production runs . a , the comparison of the rmsf values of nom recombinant protein in the complexes with the monomer form . b , the comparison of the rmsf values of hla-a * 11:01 in the complexes with the simulated monomer form . c , the comparison of the rmsf values of tlr4 in the complexes with the simulated monomer form . \n\n the graphical illustration of the monomer forms and the complex forms of the nom recombinant protein and the hla-a * 11:01 and tlr4 immune receptors . \n\n in figure 8b and figure 8c , the rmsf values of the monomer forms of the immune receptors show lower values compared to the complex forms . this behavior is exactly the opposite of the nom designed protein . this can be an indication that the structures are very stable in their natural function and their structures considerably change when they get into contact with the designed nom protein . furthermore , the structural illustration of the monomer forms and also the complex forms of the vaccine and the immune receptors , figure 9 , shows that the vaccine can fill the cavities and bind tightly to them , as it was proved by the binding energies . \n\n conclusion \n\n covid-19 pandemic is much more than a health crisis . it leads to a political , social and economic crisis in the world . the development of a safe and effective vaccine could reduce the rate of this infection . immunoinformatics methods are valuable in reducing time and cost in vaccine design and other fields of life sciences . we have predicted and validated nom recombinant protein against hla-a * 11:01 and tlr4 receptors . our evaluation was based on vaccine candidate structural analysis and molecular docking and md simulations study . the nom-tlr4 and nom-hla-a * 11:01 complexes were very stable in their natural function with strong molecular interactions in around 100 ns . higher binding energy even after the md simulation of 100 ns confirmed the stability and specificity nom-tlr4 and nom- hla-a * 11:01 interaction . our vaccine candidate can stimulate both cellular and humoral immunity , given that b and t-cell epitopes have been selected in the final construct . taken all together , according to physicochemical evaluations as well as structural and immunological analyses , nom recombinant protein could be considered as a possible vaccine candidate against covid-19 . \n\n acknowledgements \n\n this work was supported by the hormozgan university of medical sciences under grant [ number : hums-rec.1398.647 ] , bandar

february , 2020 , china has 70 635 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , including 1772 deaths [ 1 ] . human-to-human spread of the virus via respiratory droplets is currently considered to be the main route of transmission . however , exhaled air dispersion during non-invasive respiratory support may increase the risk of coronavirus transmission , and requires more attention from medical personnel and patients . \n\n non-invasive respiratory support plays an essential role in the treatment of covid-19 . more awareness is needed of viral transmission through exhaled air . http : //bit.ly/39knrrf \n\n to the editor : \n\n as of 17 february , 2020 , china has 70 635 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , including 1772 deaths . human-to-human spread of the virus via respiratory droplets is currently considered to be the main route of transmission . however , exhaled air dispersion during non-invasive respiratory support may increase the risk of coronavirus transmission , and requires more attention from medical personnel and patients . \n\n according to the chinese centre for disease control and prevention , among 72 314 reported cases in mainland china ( 44 672 confirmed cases , 16 186 suspected cases , 10 567 clinically diagnosed cases , and 889 asymptomatic infected cases ) as of 11 february , 1716 medical staff were infected . notably , wang et al . analysed the clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalised cases with covid-19 and found that the nosocomial infection rate in the study was about 41.3 % , with 17 inpatients and 40 medical staff . given the high use of respiratory support to treat dyspnoea and respiratory failure induced by covid-19 , viral transmission through exhaled air should be considered . \n\n when oxygen is delivered through nasal catheter , mask or non-invasive ventilation ( niv ) , substantial exhaled air is released into the air , which can increase dispersion of the virus , and subsequently increase the risk of nosocomial infection . prior studies have suggested that the application of high-flow nasal cannula ( hfnc ) , niv through the specific mask with optimised vent holes or the helmet with a double-limb circuit may lower the risk of airborne transmission . performing non-invasive respiratory support in a single , well-ventilated , negative pressure ward is also considered a safe option . currently , however , the majority of patients are still receiving respiratory support through nasal catheter or common mask in general wards or emergency departments with limited medical resources . the potential for airborne transmission in this population has not received enough attention . furthermore , a significant proportion of suspected patients with mild to no symptoms who are managing at home may also require long-term home oxygen or niv treatment ( e.g . patients with advanced staged copd ) . these patients may increase the risk of family cluster infections by the widespread dispersion of exhaled air in their homes . \n\n non-invasive respiratory support plays an essential role in the treatment of covid-19 , and more awareness is needed regarding the increased risk of viral transmission from exhaled air . medical staff should utilise personal protective equipment when providing respiratory support therapy . patients should wear a medical mask when receiving conventional oxygen therapy or hfnc in order to reduce air dispersion . when performing niv therapy , because helmet resources are limited and they are not frequently used in routine clinical practice , we suggest avoiding masks with vent holes and adding a filter between the mask and the vent valve to reduce viral transmission . patient beds should be at least 1 m from one another and the ward air circulation rate needs to be increased . for patients with suspected covid-19 infection receiving long-term respiratory support at home , it is recommended that they stay in a single , well-ventilated room to avoid potentially infecting their family members . \n\n shareable pdf \n\n conflict of interest : l. guan has nothing to disclose .

00010010	early in the epidemic : impact of preprints on global discourse about covid-19 transmissibility \n\n since it was first reported by who in jan 5 , 2020 , over 80 000 cases of a novel coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) have been diagnosed in china , with exportation events to nearly 90 countries , as of march 6 , 2020 . given the novelty of the causative pathogen ( named sars-cov-2 ) , scientists have rushed to fill epidemiological , virological , and clinical knowledge gaps : resulting in over 50 new studies about the virus between january 10 and january 30 alone . however , in an era where the immediacy of information has become an expectation of decision makers and the general public alike , many of these studies have been shared first in the form of preprint papers : before peer review . \n\n for the past three decades , preprint servers have become commonplace in the scientific publication ecosystem , and covid-19 has prompted a seemingly unprecedented use of these platforms . although peer-review is crucial for the validation of science , the ongoing outbreak has showcased the speed with which preprints can disseminate information during emergencies . in this comment , we used both preprint and peer-reviewed studies that estimated the transmissibility potential ( ie , basic reproduction number [ r 0 ] ) of sars-cov-2 on or before feb 1 , 2020 to investigate the role that preprints have had in information dissemination during the ongoing outbreak . we also analysed the agreement of preprint estimates compared with those presented by peer-reviewed studies and propose a consensus-based approach for evaluating the validity of preprint findings during public health crises . for our analysis , we collected publicly available data from scientific studies , news reports , and search trends pertaining to sars-cov-2 and its r 0 . defined as the average number of secondary infections that a new case might transmit in a fully susceptible population , estimates of r 0 can provide decision makers with insights into the epidemic potential of a given outbreak . \n\n relevant news reports were discovered through mediacloud and search trends by use of google search trends , and both served as a proxy indicator for information dissemination . meanwhile , relevant scientific studies were discovered through a combination of searches executed with use of google scholar and , to address possible delays in indexing , four popular public preprint servers ( ie , arxiv , biorxiv , medrxiv , and social science research network [ ssrn ] ) that we believe are representative of the relevant preprint literature . search terms and specifications for each data source are outlined in the appendix ( p 2 ) . all studies discovered through google scholar , arxiv , biorxiv , medrxiv , and ssrn were manually checked for relevance to the topic area of interest . we retained only studies that included estimates for the r 0 associated with sars-cov-2 in the body of the text . \n\n r0 mean and range estimates from 11 different studies of covid-19 as a function of time \n\n for preprints that were revised before publication of the first relevant peer-reviewed study on jan 29 , the version number is indicated between parentheses as ( n ) . when multiple r0 estimates were presented in a single study because of the use of multiple approaches , the version number is followed by a single decimal place to indicate the approach used ( n.n ) . if a first author published more than one relevant independent study before feb 1 , the version number is followed immediately by an alphabetical marker ordered by date of publication ( nx ) . ranges presented vary by study ( eg , 95 % ci , 95 % credible interval , and so on ) and are presented in the appendix ( p 3 ) . r0=basic reproduction number . \n\n after this initial data discovery phase , which yielded 11 individual studies , date of first publication , publication platform , review status ( ie , preprint vs peer-reviewed ) , and methodological details were manually curated from each study ( appendix p 3 ) . r 0 estimates were also extracted from each study for further analysis . in the event of multiple r 0 estimates : because of preprint revisions after the first version or the use of multiple approaches in a single study : each estimate was recorded and treated as a separate entry to represent all available knowledge at any given point in time ( appendix p 3 ) . given that the first known preprint estimates for r 0 were posted to ssrn by us on jan 23 , we plotted search trend fractions and news report volume between jan 23 and feb 1 ( appendix p 4 ) . baseline data for both sources before jan 23 , 2020 , yielded negligible search trend interest and news report volume , and data collected up to feb 9 , 2020 , showed diminishing interest and volume after the catchment window ( appendix p 4 ) . to illustrate when each of the 11 relevant studies became available to the public , indicator bars were overlaid against the search trend and news report data by date of publication ( appendix p 4 ) . we then plotted each of the 16 r 0 estimates produced by the 11 studies , including both the mean and the estimate range ( eg , 95 % ci , 95 % credible interval , and so on ) presented ( appendix p 3 ) . estimates were plotted by date of publication and alphabetically there-in , offering a side-by-side comparison of preprint versus peer-reviewed results ; averages and 95 % cis were also computed for both groups ( figure ) . \n\n google search trends and mediacloud data suggested that both general ( ie , search ) interest and news media interest in the r 0 associated with covid-19 peaked before the publication of relevant peer-reviewed studies during the early stages of the epidemic . in the selected time frame , search interest peaked on jan 27 after a sharp increase between jan 23 and jan 25 immediately after the publication of five early preprint studies : all of which estimated r 0 : in biorxiv , medrxiv , and ssrn . meanwhile , news media interest peaked on jan 28 , coinciding with a sixth preprint study published in arxiv ( appendix p 4 ) . the first peer-reviewed estimates were then published by li and colleagues in the new england journal of medicine on jan 29 at 17:00 h ( eastern standard time ) , followed by four additional peer-reviewed studies in eurosurveillance , the international journal of infectious diseases , the lancet , and journal of clinical medicine up to feb 1 . average r 0 estimates across the preprint group were 3 61 ( 95 % ci 2 77-4 45 ) and 2 54 ( 2 17-2 91 ) across the peer-reviewed group : showing overlap in 95 % cis despite a wide diversity of modelling methods and data sources used both in-group and across-group ( appendix p 3 ) . although the average mean for the preprint group was higher than that for the peer-reviewed group , this effect was driven primarily by two upper-limit outlier estimates ( with r 0 higher than the 95 % ci maximum ; figure ) . exclusion of these two estimates by use of a consensus-based approach based on the 95 % cis yielded an average r 0 estimate of 3 02 ( 95 % ci 2 65-3 39 ) for the preprint group . notably , two studies in the peer-reviewed group had previously been published as preprints . although estimates presented by riou and althaus remained unchanged after peer review , estimates presented by zhao and colleagues were higher before peer review than afterwards . \n\n our findings suggest that , because of the speed of their release , preprints : rather than peer-reviewed literature in the same topic area : might be driving discourse related to the ongoing covid-19 outbreak . although our analysis focused on search trends and news media data as a measure for general discourse , it is likely that preprints are also influencing policy making discussions , given that who announced on jan 26 , 2020 , that they would be creating a repository of relevant studies : including those that have not yet been peer-reviewed . \n\n nevertheless , despite the advantages of speedy information delivery , the lack of peer review can also translate into issues of credibility and misinformation , both intentional and unintentional . this particular drawback has been highlighted during the ongoing outbreak , especially after the high-profile withdrawal of a virology study from the preprint server biorxiv , which erroneously claimed that covid-19 contained hiv `` insertions '' . the very fact that this study was withdrawn showcases the power of open peer-review during emergencies ; the withdrawal itself appears to have been prompted by outcry from dozens of scientists from around the globe who had access to the study because it was placed on a public server . much of this outcry was documented on twitter ( a microblogging platform ) and on longer-form popular science blogs , signalling that such fora would serve as rich additional data sources for future work on the impact of preprints on public discourse . however , instances such as this one described showcase the need for caution when acting upon the science put forth by any one preprint . \n\n with this in mind , taking multiple studies into consideration as presented in our analysis can help operationalise the kind of caution necessitated by preprints while simultaneously allowing for important , robust insights before the publication of a peer-reviewed study in the same topic area . here , we used a simple method in which we plotted the ten r 0 estimates that were posted as preprints before publication of the first peer-reviewed study on jan 29 ; we then took the average of these estimates and excluded the two estimates that qualified as upper-limit outliers : both upon visual inspection and as a function of the 95 % ci . even before outlier elimination , this simple method yielded average r 0 estimates similar to those presented by the peer-reviewed studies subsequently published on and after jan 29 ; however , more complex approaches that incorporate weighted averages based on estimate confidence , similar to traditional meta-analytical methods , offer a promising avenue for future work . such collective , consensus-based approaches will arguably be easiest to use when the research of interest is quantitative in nature ; nevertheless , given that many crucial epidemiological parameters that inform decision making ( eg , incubation period , generation time , and so on ) are quantitative , our proposed approach could work well in these contexts as well . \n\n our work showcases the powerful role preprints can have during public health crises because of the timeliness with which they can disseminate new information . furthermore , given that two of the preprints included in this analysis were later published in peer-reviewed outlets , the evidence shows that that even prestigious journals now permit the sharing of important findings before peer review and that the use of preprint platforms does not jeopardise future peer-reviewed publication . without question , primacy and peer-reviewed publications are key metrics in individual professional advancement ( eg , academic promotion ) ; nevertheless , the impact of preprints on discourse and decision making pertaining to the ongoing covid-19 outbreak suggests that we must rethink how we reward and recognise community contributions during present and future public health crises . \n\n references \n\n\n\n

01100000	potential cytoprotective activity of ozone therapy in sars-cov-2/covid-19 . \n\n ( 1 ) background : the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) disease ( covid-19 ) in china at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak . systemic ozone therapy ( ot ) could be potentially useful in the clinical management of several complications secondary to sars-cov-2 . the rationale and mechanism of action has already been proven clinically in other viral infections and has been shown in research studies to be highly effective at decreasing organ damage mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress . this review summarizes the ot studies that illustrate the possible cytoprotective mechanism of action of ozone and its physiological by-products in target organs affected by sars-cov-2 . ( 2 ) methods : this review encompasses a total of 74 peer-reviewed original articles . it is mainly focused on ozone as a modulator of the nf-kappa b/nrf2 pathways and il-6/il-1beta expression . ( 3 ) results : in experimental models and the few existent clinical studies , homeostasis of the free radical and antioxidant balance by ot was associated with a modulation of nf-kappa b/nrf2 balance and il-6 and il-1beta expression . these molecular mechanisms support the cytoprotective effects of ot against tissue damage present in many inflammatory diseases , including viral infections . ( 4 ) conclusions : the potential cytoprotective role of ot in the management of organ damage induced by covid-19 merits further research . controlled clinical trials are needed . 
01001000	perspective from ecuador , the second country with more confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in south america : a review \n\n to face the pandemic outbreak of a novel coronavirus many countries developed a series of containment methods ; however , developing countries in south america had reacted apathetically to this worldwide concern . ecuador 's response to the novel virus coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) started on february 26 , 2020 , one month after the outbreak began in china . as of today , the countries with more confirmed cases in south america are brazil and ecuador . although brazil has two times the number of cases than ecuador ( brazil : 700 cases per 100000 people vs. ecuador : 400 cases per 100000 ) , the huge population difference between the two countries raises concerns about the public health policies implemented by the ecuadorian government . even though there is no cure for covid-19 , chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are promising alternatives . the covid-19 pandemic outbreak has shown that there is room for improvement in the healthcare systems worldwide and the disastrous results on the fragile often unprepared are those systems in developing countries . \n\n introduction and background \n\n alarm bells over the world started to ring after the news regarding a case of pneumonia caused by a novel virus in wuhan , china . the virus supposedly originated in one of the largest markets in wuhan . on january 7 , 2020 , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) isolated the virus and called it severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) . the disease caused by this virus was named coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) by the world health organization ( who ) . \n\n even though the majority of cases present with flu-like symptoms , 3.4 % of patients develop severe pneumonia , septic shock , respiratory failure , and multiorgan failure leading to a fatal outcome . \n\n on january 30 , 2020 , the who declared the covid-19 outbreak a global health emergency . countries applied many measures , hoping to contain the spread of the disease ; for example , restricting mobility and quarantines . additionally , incoming flights from countries with a high prevalence of the disease were suspended , first from china and then followed by italy and spain . \n\n in south america , brazil is the country with the highest number of covid-19-confirmed cases followed by ecuador . although brazil has two times the number of cases than ecuador , it is important to analyze the prevalence of the disease in the context of the countries ' population . while brazil , with a population of 212,559,417 , has a total of 1,549 confirmed cases ( 0.007 % ) ; ecuador , with a population of 17,567,751 , has 789 confirmed cases ( 0.004 % ) . the greater ratio of cases per population in ecuador raises the concern about the efficacy of the containment measures and public health policies taken by the country . \n\n the limitations of the healthcare systems in developing countries increase their chances of being affected more during a pandemic outbreak . \n\n review \n\n confirmed cases and ecuadorian response \n\n after the announcement that covid-19 was spreading rapidly across asian countries , european countries went into an alarm state and started to design containment measures while south american countries reacted apathetically , delaying decisions on preventive measures , underestimating the severity of the events . \n\n ecuador 's response to the novel virus covid-19 started on february 26 , 2020 . the set of measures included monitoring the temperature and other covid-19-related symptoms in travelers from high-risk countries . on february 29 , 2020 , ecuador confirmed the first case of covid-19 . the patient had arrived from spain two weeks before the diagnosis was made . \n\n after the who declared covid-19 as a pandemic outbreak on march 11 , 2020 , ecuador declared a national health emergency . all non-essential activities were suspended indefinitely and the use of virtual platforms was encouraged for academic activities , jobs , and medical care . as did other countries did , ecuador also closed its land , air , and sea borders to citizens and non-citizens for 21 days . restrictions to vehicular or pedestrian traffic and a national curfew from 7 pm to 5 am also took place . \n\n despite these measures , the virus continued spreading across the ecuadorian provinces . on march 23 , 2020 , 789 confirmed patients with covid-19 and 18 deaths related to the virus were reported by the ministry of health of ecuador . the mortality rate was similar to other countries . the number of confirmed patients increased , so did the number of people in epidemiological monitoring and quarantine . \n\n the infection risk in physicians also increases in countries with a high prevalence of sars-cov-2 . in italy , more than 3,000 health providers were infected becoming an increasing concern among health providers worldwide . in ecuador , 24 doctors have been tested positive for the virus one month after the first patient 's admission with covid-19 . the rising number of physicians testing positive for covid-19 raises concern amid a growing outcry over the shortage of protective equipment and medical supplies . \n\n guayas , with 607 confirmed cases , is by far the most affected province by covid-19 in ecuador . measures applied in the rest of the country with relative success failed in this province . the out-of-control increase in confirmed cases poses the risk of collapsing the health care system there . this situation led the government to declare the province as a national security zone , leaving operational planning to the army . \n\n transmission \n\n the transmission was described as animal-to-person in affected patients at the huanan seafood wholesale market of wuhan . at the moment , person-to-person transmission and fomite transmission have been linked with the spread of the illness . li compiled information on the dynamics of the novel virus , estimating a transmission rate of r0 2.2 for covid-19 . in addition , cascella mentions that close contact with an infected person is needed to transmit the virus . therefore , relatives and health professionals are at greater risk . \n\n there are some discrepancies about the transmission . while some studies support the animal-to-human transmission , including a case of a pet that tested positive for covid-19 , the cdc states that there is no evidence that pets can transmit the virus or present the symptomology of infection . \n\n prevention \n\n the main goal in the control of a pandemic outbreak is to achieve r0 less than 1 ( one positive patient can infect less than one extra person ) . to reach this goal , prevention is paramount . \n\n the who and cdc recommend avoiding contact with symptomatic people and agglomerations . basic hygiene practices , such as constant hand washing and the use of face masks in symptomatic patients , are also recommended to prevent the spread of the virus . \n\n many countries utilized quarantine and mobilization restrictions to control the spread ; however , these measures may not be sufficient in developing countries such as ecuador . \n\n pathophysiology \n\n the cause of covid-19 is a ribonucleic acid ( rna ) virus of the coronaviridae family called sars-cov-2 . although the exact pathophysiology of sars-cov-2 is unknown , its structural similarity with other viruses of the coronaviridae family allows an understanding of its dynamics and the evolution of the disease . the clinical presentation may vary from flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia similar to sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n channappanavar and granlinski mention that the most aggressive strains of the coronavirinae family , like sars-cov , have protein e in their envelope that stimulates nf-kb , a protein complex involved in cellular responses , including stress , cytokine signaling , response to viral infections , and apoptosis . protein e , along with other proteins , interferes with the host immune response ( tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) alpha and interleukin 6 ( il-6 ) ) . these processes produce uncontrolled inflammation , resulting in lung edema and fibrosis . \n\n treatment \n\n efforts to control covid-19 had been made by many countries , starting with investigations to develop a vaccine from the attenuated or inactive virus . the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases announced the beginning of the first trial on 45 volunteers between 18 and 55 years old . this first phase is estimated to last for six weeks . the kaiser research institute is evaluating the feasibility of the mrna-1723 vaccine . \n\n the management of patients with acute respiratory syndrome consists of assisted oxygen ventilation to achieve a saturation percentage of oxygen ( spo2 ) of 90 % and antipyretics . \n\n multiple drugs are being studied to treat covid-19 , with promising results . in the united states and china , a randomized clinical trial has been initiated to test the efficacy of remdesivir . at the moment , oseltamivir , a neuraminidase inhibitor , has been used more extensively . \n\n chloroquine , a drug used worldwide , has a promising effect in the treatment of severe pneumonia by covid-19 at a dose of 500 mg2 times a day ; however , zhou questions its use due to its side effects . instead of using chloroquine , zhou suggests hydroxychloroquine as an alternative treatment . hydroxychloroquine seems to attenuate the progression to more severe scenarios of covd-19 infection , although its dosage still needs further study . \n\n conclusions \n\n the low mortality of covid-19 may be the reason for developing countries underestimating the magnitude of this pandemic outbreak . the health care systems risk collapsing due to the increasing number of confirmed patients who need intensive care and the spread of the disease in health providers . the high demand for financial and human resources by this disease leads to a collateral increase in mortality from other causes . the covid-19 pandemic outbreak has shown that there is still room for improvement in healthcare systems worldwide to prevent its catastrophic impact , especially on the fragile and often unprepared systems in developing countries . \n\n the authors have declared that no competing interests exist . \n\n references \n\n cnn . ? cual es la tasa de mortalidad del coronavirus ?

10000000	multistage ct features of coronavirus disease 2019 . \n\n objectives : to determine imaging features of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in different stages , and to provide foundations for early diagnosis and treatment . methods : ct image data of 187 covid-19 patients were analyzed in the period of hospitalization . ct scanning was performed on admission and repeated every 3 days . the improvement time of clinical symptoms and the image changes of follow-up ct were statistically analyzed . results : all 187 patients ' nucleic acid test were positive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) . the early ct images of lung in 187 cases ( 100 % ) showed multiple patchy and ground-glass opacities with fine mesh and consolidation shade , which mainly distributed in pulmonary band or under the pleura . in the progressive stage , the pulmonary lesions in 146 cases ( 78.1 % ) were mainly consolidation , accompanied by air bronchogram , thickening of blood vessels , and interstitial changes . severe pulmonary ct images in 15 cases ( 8 % ) showed diffuse lesions in both lungs , displaying consolidation , or `` white lung '' . the ct imaging features in 185 cases ( 98.9 % ) at the absorptive period showed that the lesions diminished and fibrogenesis . the imaging features of 6 times of lung ct examination in one case showed continuous progress . the original lesion in one case was obviously absorbed , but new lesions appeared under the pleura of both lungs at the third review of ct scanning . the changes of ct imaging lesions during follow-up were significantly different in different clinical symptoms improvement time ( p < 0.01 ) . conclusions : images of covid-19 in various stages have special characteristics . the change of clinical symptoms is synchronous with the change of reexamination ct . follow-up ct can reflect the trend of clinical changes . repeat ct examination plays an important role in the early clinical diagnosis and the evaluation for the therapeutic effect on covid-19 patient .

00000100	covid-19 pneumonia with hemoptysis : acute segmental pulmonary emboli associated with novel coronavirus infection . \n\n recent retrospective studies from wuhan , china suggest novel coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) may be associated with a hypercoagulable state and increased risk for venous thromboembolism . the overlap in the signs and symptoms of covid-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) and covid-19 with concurrent pulmonary embolism creates a diagnostic challenge for emergency medicine physicians in patients already at risk for renal impairment . however , identifying features atypical for covid-19 alone may play a role in the judicious use of computed tomography angiography among these patients . hemoptysis is seen in roughly 13 % of pulmonary embolism cases and infrequently reported among covid-19 infections . additionally , the presence of right heart strain on electrocardiography ( ekg ) is a well described clinical presentations of pulmonary embolism not reported commonly with covid-19 infections . 
00000001	a uk-wide british society of thoracic imaging covid-19 imaging repository and database : design , rationale and implications for education and research \n\n introduction \n\n the number of cases of covid-19 continues to rise in the uk and around the world . the precise role for computed tomography ( ct ) in the diagnosis and triage of suspected cases , assessing for complications , and surveillance is subject to change and are explored in other articles in this edition ; however , keeping the uk diagnostic community fully informed of emerging guidance during the covid-19 outbreak is critical . this can be achieved as a collaborative effort by feeding a central library of the medical examples encountered and rapidly sharing expert opinions to frontline medical care staff , nationally and internationally . \n\n the british society of thoracic imaging ( bsti ) , in conjunction with cimar uk 's imaging cloud technology ( cimar.co.uk ) , have designed , built , and deployed a simple , free to use , anonymised , and encrypted online portal to upload and refer imaging of patients with either confirmed or suspected covid-19 . from these cases , the bsti are providing an imaging database of known uk patient examples for reference and teaching . the aim is to disseminate breaking clinical and diagnostic advice rapidly to frontline healthcare staff nationally , using real imaging examples encountered across the country . \n\n all imaging and supporting data are stored at uk cloud ( https : //ukcloudhealth.com ) with no identifiable metadata . imaging can be uploaded at http : //bit.ly/bsticovid19_database . the published teaching library and its content will be accessible without a login via the bsti website ( https : //bit.ly/bsticovid19_teaching_library ) . \n\n the role of registries in radiology \n\n registry data can be essential in the development of radiology diagnosis and shared learning . they have sometimes changed practice , for example , the identification of high rates of morbidity in patients undergoing emergency biliary procedures via the swedish registry gallriks , and complications in vascular surgery via vascular registries . \n\n the royal college of radiologists document `` setting up a regional or national digital teaching archive '' makes clear that such databases are needed for developing the knowledge and skills of radiology trainees , but would also significantly benefit trained radiologists . this is perhaps even more pertinent in the face of a new virus whose imaging features can be varied and unfamiliar . indeed , it has long been recognised that breaking down technological barriers to contributing imaging studies directly from a picture archiving and communications system ( pacs ) viewer to a central imaging repository would make teaching and research in the national health service ( nhs ) more efficient and accurate . overcoming such a bottleneck would also deliver the potential to exponentially upskill the radiology workforce in the early and accurate diagnosis of covid-19 , in what is currently a highly dynamic situation . by bringing together thoracic ct expertise across the uk , a central covid-19 imaging repository and database can help reduce unwarranted diagnostic variation , provide better quality care for patients , and provide a resource to accumulate knowledge rapidly . such a database would also allow real-time tracking of confirmed ct cases and allow improved understanding of the significance of cases with positive ct findings , but negative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( rt-pcr ) results . this will help collate valuable information for the nhs and public health england . \n\n technical aspects and registry design \n\n refer a case ( upload link ) : https : //bit.ly/bsticovid19_database . \n\n teaching library access : https : //bit.ly/bsticovid19_teaching_library . \n\n the platform is provided free of cost by cimar.co.uk , a uk-hosted cloud-pacs and image sharing service , ( powered by ambra health inc. technology ) . more than 9 billion images are hosted globally by this cloud , across 55 countries , connecting thousands of hospitals and imaging sites for over 700 clinical trials . the service is increasingly used by the nhs to solve imaging storage , interoperability , and rapid sharing needs . referred cases can be uploaded from any hospital or location . they will then be routed through a restricted access workflow to a panel of bsti diagnostic experts for approval and annotation , prior to general access to healthcare professionals being granted . all cases will be automatically anonymised by the cloud-software at the point of upload and access does not require changes to individual/organisation firewalls . all connections are secure and encrypted ( https/tls1.2 ) . no hardware is required . \n\n users can view the published teaching library , diagnostic observations , and training materials online using chrome , firefox , safari , apple or pc machines , as well as any other browser or mobile device . a diagnostic food and drug administration ( fda ) approved html5 viewer loads automatically for the user , so no special software , downloads , or installations are required to access and use the resource . \n\n the requirement for data protection impact assessment ( dpia ) forms will be the decision of each individual trust ; however , completed and signed-off dpia from the royal united hospitals bath , nhs foundation trust , is available as a template if required ( see electronic supplementary material appendix s1 ) . a `` frequently asked questions '' document is also available ( see electronic supplementary material appendix s2 ) . it is also now noted that the information commissioner has assured nhsx that she can not envisage a situation where she would take action against a health or care professional clearly trying to deliver care related to the covid-19 crisis . all data is anonymised from the point of upload through to its viewing . the full dataset will only be viewable by the bsti covid-19 imaging repository and database panel ( and other agreed parties with suitable clinical expertise ; the software has role-based access only ) . from the core imaging repository and database , teaching material will be published and refreshed on a regular basis . the imaging will only be stored for as long as the bsti executive committee deems it necessary . for bsti-appointed expert panel members , access to the full dataset is through a pre-registered login with a strong ( forced renewable ) password . access is audited , captured , and all usage is logged . the published teaching library and its content can be accessed without a login as a freely accessible teaching resource for radiologists . \n\n the bsti covid-19 registry : education \n\n the reported chest radiography and ct signs in covid-19 vary depending upon time of imaging from symptom onset and disease severity . patients with covid-19 may present to any hospital initially and radiologists have a duty to be aware of findings that are compatible with the diagnosis . there is a national shortage of radiologists , with the current shortfall estimated to be 1,104 . of existing radiologists , `` chest/lung '' is the fifth most popular subspecialty interest , but the provision of subspecialty thoracic radiology also varies dramatically across the uk . the bsti aim to produce a resource that helps to upskill all radiologists in the evolving clinical climate of covid-19 . in addition , webinars using content from the bsti covid-19 database are planned in conjunction with the royal college of radiologists . \n\n the bsti covid-19 database : research \n\n as of 8 march 2020 , there were 585 published articles on pubmed ( https : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed ) using the search phrase `` covid-19 '' . the world health organization has set covid-19 research as a priority . the largest imaging study in covid-19 ( in more than 1,000 patients from china ) raised the question of the role of ct in diagnosis , particularly in patients who are at high clinical risk , but had a negative initial real-time rt-pcr for the virus ; however , as the authors acknowledge , `` clinical and laboratory data were limited during this urgent period when regional hospitals were overloaded '' . consequently , it is uncertain if the ct findings are simply an epiphenomenon of the clinical or laboratory findings . through a united effort to submit cases to the bsti covid-19 imaging repository and database across the entire nhs , there is a real opportunity to add to the evidence base in the diagnosis and risk stratification of cases . the case upload with be accompanied by brief clinic metrics ( including patient age , sex , white cell count , c-reactive protein , p02 , indication for the imaging , rt-pcr status , prior imaging ) , which will help understand the temporal trends in imaging and the relevance of imaging findings in the context of known clinical and laboratory data . \n\n unfortunately , covid-19 is now a global pandemic , and the database has the potential to rapidly upscale to host nested registries for other countries and provide a global imaging perspective . all contributors will be considered collaborators on research outputs . \n\n summary \n\n for the bsti covid-19 imaging repository and database to realise its potential in education and research in the uk and across the globe , we call on all radiologists to engage and upload cases . every case of covid-19 counts . \n\n conflict of interest \n\n the authors declare no conflict of interest . \n\n references \n\n an update on covid-19 for the radiologist : a british society of thoracic imaging statement \n\n a statement from the british society of thoracic imaging statement : considerations in designing local imaging diagnostic algorithms \n\n mortality after a cholecystectomy : a population-based study \n\n vascular services quality improvement programme \n\n\n\n the royal college of radiologists \n\n world health authority . world experts and funders set priorities for covid-19 research \n\n correlation of chest ct and rt-pcr testing in coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in china : a report of 1014 cases \n\n supplementary data \n\n the following are the supplementary data to this article : \n\n supplementary data to this article can be found online at https : //doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2020.03.005 . 
00000100	how do we decide to de-isolate covid-19 patients ? \n\n since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in december 2019 , the number of individuals affected by the disease has rapidly risen . it has been suggested that the disease is contagious during the incubation period in infected patients . however , the duration for which the disease remains contagious in the patients is not known . it is not known as to how and when can a decision be made to de-isolate these patients to avoid the transmission of the causative virus i.e . severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) . serial collections of oropharyngeal swab and sputum specimens are recommended by the taiwan centers for disease control and prevention ( taiwan cdc ) to detect sars-cov-2 from the upper airways in covid-19 patients . based on this , we hypothesized that virus detection from the upper airways may have a direct correlation with the possibility of transmission . in this study , we observed the clinical course and presence of sars-cov-2 rna in serial collections of specimens from the upper airways of two patients with covid-19 . \n\n clinical course of the wife and the husband with covid-19 and the threshold cycle ( ct ) values of rrt-pcr for sars-cov-2 in their oropharyngeal swab and saliva specimens . \n\n fig . 1 \n\n on january 28 , 2020 , a previously healthy non-smoking 44-year-old female , visited the out-patient clinic at the hospital . the patient complained of having a fever and headache since january 27 , 2020 ( fig . 1 ) . physical examinations revealed a body temperature of 39.3 c , and an oxygen saturation of 96 % in room air . the patient had not traveled abroad in the past three months and lived with her husband and their 18-year-old son . her 43-year-old husband , a smoker without any systemic disease , worked in the hanyang district of wuhan city , china and returned to taiwan on january 12 , 2020 . thereafter , he developed rhinorrhea on january 21 , 2020 , and later visited the clinic . he denied any history of being involved with the huanan seafood wholesale market in wuhan . his chest x-ray showed no abnormal findings . after he was prescribed antihistamines , his rhinorrhea quickly improved after three days . \n\n laboratory data of the wife revealed mild lymphopenia ( 642/mul ; reference range , 650-4300/mul ) and an elevated level of alanine aminotransferase ( 38 units/l ; reference range , 7-35 units/l ) . rapid antigen tests for influenza a , b , and adenovirus from throat swabs of the patient were all negative . under the suspicion of a covid-19 infection from her husband , she was admitted to the airborne isolation unit . we notified the taiwan cdc immediately . according to the guidelines of the taiwan cdc , an oropharyngeal swab and a sputum specimen must be examined for a suspected covid-19 patient . however , an oropharyngeal swab and saliva specimens were obtained because she had no respiratory symptoms . the taiwan cdc laboratory confirmed that the wife 's oropharyngeal swab was positive for sars-cov-2 rna using a real-time-reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( rrt-pcr ) assay . we immediately performed an oropharyngeal swab test for the husband . his oropharyngeal swab also showed a positive result . he was also admitted to the isolation unit . \n\n during the wife 's hospitalization , she was prescribed diclofenac as she complained about having a severe headache . she suffered from a general skin rash and face swelling after taking the medicine . we discontinued all prescriptions and administered three doses of intravenous 4 mg dexamethasone , 12 h apart , for her suspected hypersensitivity to non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs . her rash and face swelling subsided soon . on the fifth day of observation , her fever and headache improved . during admission , her chest x-ray did not show any abnormal infiltrates . \n\n serial collections of oropharyngeal swab and saliva specimens were performed according to the guidelines of taiwan cdc . the aforementioned tests returned positive and then negative results on day 17 and 19 , respectively , since the onset of the illness ( fig . 1 ) . subsequently , her swab and saliva specimens showed positive results again . on days 28 , 30 , and 32 , since the onset of the disease , the swab and saliva specimens showed negative results on all the three days . the patient 's stool sample tested negative on day 9 . we decided to discontinue her isolation after discussing with the experts of the taiwan cdc on day 33 . \n\n during the husband 's hospitalization , his oropharyngeal swab and saliva both tested positive on day 15 since the onset of the illness . on the 17th , 19th , 21st days , his oropharyngeal swab and saliva specimens tested negative . his stool sample showed a positive result on the 17th day of the illness , but then a negative result on the 19th day . isolation for him was discontinued on the 22nd day of the illness . \n\n according to the previous reports , the presentations were variable for the covid-19 patients . patients may be asymptomatic or may present with a mild cough , a fever , respiratory failure , acute respiratory distress syndrome , or potentially fatal outcomes . the contagious period of sars-cov-2 infection is not known . consequently , it is debatable as to when covid-19 patients can be de-isolated . we hypothesized that transmission via respiratory droplets is possible when the viruses are detectable in the patients ' upper airways . the taiwan cdc guidelines recommend serial collections of upper airway specimens for detecting the virus . \n\n our observations showed that the wife had more severe symptoms , such as a fever and headache , than the husband , and she received corticosteroid therapy for her hypersensitivity . she had much longer and intermittent virus detections from her upper airway in comparison to her husband . the wife may have had a higher viral load than the husband since she showed severe symptoms . it might also be more difficult for her to achieve virus clearance from the upper airway . moreover , since she was on corticosteroid therapy , the influence on viral clearance is not known . however , this factor may prolong virus shedding according to other coronavirus observations . individual immune responses for virus clearance may also influence the results . \n\n furthermore , live viruses are related to true transmission . we do not know whether the positive results of rrt-pcr refer to a persistent infection or to the presence of residual sequences of viral rna , as we did not perform virus cultures . the taiwan cdc guidelines have been upgraded to mention that the patients who show three continuous negative results of rrt-pcr from oropharyngeal swabs and sputum ( or saliva ) specimens from the upper airways can be de-isolated . in this case , we de-isolated the patients on february 28 , 2020 , based on the three consecutively negative results , \n\n three additional issues have been raised in this report . firstly , we collected saliva specimens in addition to oropharyngeal swabs of our patients for sars-cov-2 testing . previous studies have mentioned that the sars-cov2 was also detected in the saliva of covid-19 patients and serial saliva viral load monitoring generally showed a declining trend . saliva is considered a promising non-invasive specimen for diagnosis and monitoring . secondly , the rrt-pcr results in oropharyngeal swab and saliva samples turned to positive from negative were observed in the wife . this might be due to the variations in quality for sample collection and the viral loads , especially when prior series of samples with high cycle threshold values were noted . thirdly , our patient was prescribed with diclofenac , a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( nsaid ) for headache relief . diclofenac and ibuprofen are commonly used nsaids for pain-relieving agents . a previous study shows that ibuprofen could increase the binding affinity between sars-cov2 and its target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) , which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung , intestine , kidney , and blood vessels , and increased the risk of developing severe illness of covid-19 . acetaminophen seems to be a better choice than ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatory drugs . however , these preliminary observation and speculations need further investigation in the future . \n\n in conclusion , the wife had a more severe course of the disease and was under corticosteroid treatment . the virus was detected for a longer period in the upper airway of the wife as compared to her husband . however , we still do not know the actual contagious period of sars-cov-2 infection . currently , the rrt-pcr results of serial specimens from the upper airways are the only way to decide whether covid-19 patients can be de-isolated . further studies on individual immune responses against the virus infection are required . methods to distinguish a persistent infection from residual viral rna sequences are also required . furthermore , epidemiological data of the contagion may need to be collected and analyzed to understand the actual contagious period of sars-cov-2 infection . \n\n references \n\n a novel

01100000	the contribution of diabetic micro-angiopathy to adverse outcomes in covid-19 \n\n increasing evidence points to endothelial cell dysfunction as a key pathophysiological factor in severe coronavirus disease-19 ( covid-19 ) , manifested by platelet aggregation , microthrombi and altered vasomotor tone . this may be driven by direct endothelial cell entry by the virus , or indirectly by activated inflammatory cascade . major risk groups identified for adverse outcomes in covid-19 are diabetes , and those from the black , asian and ethnic minority ( bame ) populations . hyperglycaemia ( expressed as glycated haemoglobin or mean hospital glucose ) correlates with worse outcomes in covid-19 . it is not known whether hyperglycaemia is causative or is a surrogate marker - persistent hyperglycaemia is well known as an aetiological agent in microangiopathy . in this article , we propose that pre-existing endothelial dysfunction of microangiopathy , more commonly evident in diabetes and bame groups , makes an individual vulnerable to the subsequent 'endothelitis ' of covid-19 infection . \n\n there is emerging understanding that coronavirus disease-19 ( covid-19 ) induced respiratory complications appear to have a distinct pattern that differs from typical adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) . it is characterised by a dissociation between relatively well-preserved lung mechanics and the severity of hypoxemia . a possible explanation for the severe hypoxemia occurring in compliant lungs , is the loss of lung perfusion regulation and hypoxic vasoconstriction . coagulation dysfunction also appears to be common in severe covid-19 , with fatal cases exhibiting diffuse microvascular thrombosis , suggesting a thrombogenic microangiopathy . \n\n it is becoming increasingly recognised , therefore , that endothelial damage and pulmonary microvascular thrombosis are central to the clinical severity of covid-19 . endothelial access by the virus is mediated via the protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) , which is highly expressed on vascular tissue . replication of virus within the host cell can cause direct cellular damage and release of pro-inflammatory signals . angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ( ace-2 ) consumption by viral entry would be predicted to increase local angiotensin-ii concentration , contributing to vasoconstriction , endothelial activation , and pro-inflammatory cytokine release - inducing further alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial cell damage . endothelial cell involvement may then spread across vascular beds of different organs . \n\n both diabetes and ethnicity appear to be additional risk factors emerging in clinical sequelae of the covid-19 pandemic . within the hospitalised covid-19 population , individuals with diabetes are over-represented . a systematic review reported a significant association between diabetes and covid-19 infection severity ( odds ratio 2.67 , 95 % ci 1.91-3.74 ) . subsequent data from china estimated mortality rates near 10 % in diabetes , from a sample of 72,314 confirmed cases . the most recent publication , comprising 7,336 patients , showed the risk of fatal outcome from covid-19 was up to 50 % higher in patients with diabetes . furthermore , well-controlled blood glucose was associated with lower hospital mortality than poorly controlled glucose ( hazard ratio 0.14 ) . \n\n diabetes is characterised , not only by hyperglycaemia , but also endothelial dysfunction and microcirculatory impairment . microvascular disease ( either retinopathy or nephropathy ) is present in over one-third of newly-diagnosed patients with type-2 diabetes ( t2d ) . the consequences of endothelial dysfunction include dysregulation of vasodilation , fibrinolysis , and anti-aggregation - classically leading to macrovascular disease - and may contribute to microvascular disease retinopathy , nephropathy and neuropathy . however , evidence of microvascular dysfunction in one organ is a marker of systemic injury . it is increasingly recognised that there are microvascular pulmonary complications of diabetes ( 'diabetic lung ' ) . it has been suggested that reduced pulmonary diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide ( dlco ) may be attributed to vascular injury of pulmonary capillaries related to diabetic microangiopathy . importantly , the functional impairment was directly related to the degree of glucose control ( glycated haemoglobin - hba1c ) and the presence of diabetic microvascular complications including retinopathy , neuropathy , and microalbuminuria in a sex-specific manner . the relationship of impaired gas exchange with diabetes was observed , even in those who had never smoked . in these individuals , the pulmonary microvasculature may be poorly prepared to meet the challenge of covid-19 infection . \n\n the black , asian and minority ethnic ( bame ) community have suffered disproportionally from covid-19 . bame , although only 13 % of the united kingdom population and a younger age distribution , accounts for one third of all covid-19 cases and 34 % of critically-ill covid-19 patients . the mechanisms underlying the disproportionate effect of covid-19 infection on bame patients remain incompletely understood . however , bame groups have a disproportionally high prevalence of t2d and disparities have been observed in diabetes control , monitoring and presence of microvascular complications in the bame , compared to white population . in this context , dysglycaemia ( both hba1c and mean glucose ) associating with adverse outcomes in covid-19 , may be surrogates for the presence and severity of underlying microvascular disease . the prevalence of prediabetes among adults is approximately 38 % and 35 % , in the united states and united kingdom respectively . prediabetes is also over-represented in bame population . in the uk , the hazard ratio for prediabetes in south asians was 1.67 ( 1.12 to 2.50 ) and for blacks 1.45 ( 0.92 to 2.27 ) , compared to the white population . although it is alluring to think that people with prediabetes are protected from microvascular disease ; early stages of retinopathy , nephropathy , and neuropathy have been reported in people with prediabetes , with a prevalence of up to 10 % . \n\n microvascular disease and endothelial dysfunction may underlie adverse outcomes in covid-19 and may represent the pathophysiological key missing link that identifies susceptible populations and may require specific treatment . analyses of data on patients with covid-19 should include details of diabetes complications and age , to untangle the complex interaction between ethnicity , diabetes and covid-19 outcomes . \n\n conflict of interest \n\n the authors declare no conflict of interest . \n\n funding \n\n the authors received no funding from an external source . \n\n references \n\n covid-19 does not lead

11000000	clinical characteristics of 145 patients with corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in taizhou , zhejiang , china . \n\n objective : the aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of corona virus disease 2019 in taizhou , china . methods : a single center retrospective observational study was performed between jan 1 , 2020 and mar 11 , 2020 at taizhou public health medical center , zhejiang , china . all patients with confirmed corona virus disease 2019 were enrolled , and their clinical data were gathered by reviewing electronic medical records . outcomes of severely ill patients and non-severely ill patients were compared . results : of 145 hospitalized patients with covid-19 , the average age was 47.5 years old ( standard deviation , 14.6 ) and 54.5 % were men . hypertension was the most common comorbidity ( 15.2 % ) , followed by diabetes mellitus ( 9.7 % ) . common symptoms included dry cough ( 81.4 % ) , fever ( 75.2 % ) , anorexia ( 42.8 % ) , fatigue ( 40.7 % ) , chest tightness ( 32.4 % ) , diarrhea ( 26.9 % ) and dizziness ( 20 % ) . according to imaging examination , 79.3 % patients showed bilateral pneumonia , 18.6 % showed unilateral pneumonia , 61.4 % showed ground-glass opacity , and 2.1 % showed no abnormal result . compared with non-severely ill patients , severely ill patients were older ( mean , years , 52.8 vs. 45.3 , p < 0.01 ) , had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus ( 16.3 % vs. 6.9 % , p = 0.08 ) , had a higher body mass index ( mean , 24.78 vs. 23.20 , p = 0.02 ) and were more likely to have fever ( 90.7 % vs. 68.6 % , p = 0.01 ) , anorexia ( 60.5 % vs. 35.3 % , p = 0.01 ) , chest tightness ( 60.5 % vs.20.6 % , p < 0.01 ) and dyspnea ( 7.0 % vs. 0 % , p = 0.03 ) . of the 43 severely ill patients , 6 ( 14 % ) received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy , and 1 ( 2.3 % ) received invasive mechanical ventilation . conclusions : older patients or patients with comorbidities such as obesity or diabetes mellitus were more likely to have severe condition . treatments of covid-19 is still experimental and more clinical trials are needed . 
00001000	the possible impact of covid-19 on colorectal surgery in italy . \n\n the covid-19 outbreak in italy is stopping access to elective benign disease treatment and changing the approach to malignant disease as well as the outpatients care of those patients treated for colorectal cancer . the lack of knowledge about the possible implications of the spread of the infection during surgery could extend to infect surgeons , surgery nurses and also the anesthesiologists , the results will become evident in the long term . the surgical approach may change going towards less invasive procedures to minimize the aerosolized biological fluids , this approach could reduce the access to first level hospitals changing the entire health care system in the future . 
00001000	optimizing the trauma resuscitation bay during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n the covid-19 global pandemic due to the sars-cov2 ( cov2 ) virus has created the need to adapt hospital workspaces and staffing models , and trauma is no exception . while the optimal configuration of a trauma resuscitation area is debatable , the space needs to be large enough to accommodate the trauma team and ancillary staff . it also needs to have ready access to supplies and equipment to quickly and easily control hemorrhage , secure an airway and initiate fluid resuscitation . lastly , stores of personal protective equipment in the form of fluid resistant gowns , head covering , face shield , and gloves ( both sterile and non-sterile ) should be readily available but under strict access . as cov2 carriers increased in our population in new jersey , we treated each incoming trauma patient as a potentially cov2-positive case and sought to reconfigure out trauma resuscitation area to minimize exposure of our supplies to aerosolized virus . 
00001000	youtube as a source of medical information on the novel coronavirus 2019 disease ( covid-19 ) pandemic . \n\n media coverage on coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) has been extensive , yet large gaps remain in our understanding of the role of social media platforms during worldwide health crisis . the purpose of this study was to assess the most viewed youtube videos on covid-19 for medical content . we coded video characteristics , source , and medical content of the 113 most-widely viewed videos about covid-19 . seventy-nine ( 69.9 % ) videos were classified as useful , and 10 ( 8.8 % ) videos were classified as misleading . independent users were more likely to post misleading videos than useful videos ( 60.0 % vs 21.5 % , p = 0.009 ) . news agencies were more likely to post useful videos than misleading videos ( 72.2 % vs 40.0 % , p = 0.039 ) . useful videos were more likely to present any information on prevalence or incidence ( 79.7 % vs 20.0 % , p < 0.001 ) , as well as information on outcomes or prognosis ( 84.8 % vs 30.0 % , p < 0.001 ) compared to misleading videos . the world health organization contributed one useful video ( 1.3 % ) , while no videos from the center for disease control were included . although youtube generally is a useful source of medical information on the covid-19 pandemic , increased efforts to disseminate accurate information from reputable sources is desired to help mitigate disease spread and decrease unnecessary panic in the general population . 
00001010	estimating the infection fatality rate among symptomatic covid-19 cases in the united states . \n\n knowing the infection fatality rate ( ifr ) of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infections is essential for the fight against the covid-19 pandemic . using data through april 20 , 2020 , we fit a statistical model to covid-19 case fatality rates over time at the us county level to estimate the covid-19 ifr among symptomatic cases ( ifr-s ) as time goes to infinity . the ifr-s in the us was estimated to be 1.3 % ( 95 % central credible interval : 0.6 % to 2.1 % ) . county-specific rates varied from 0.5 % to 3.6 % . the overall ifr for covid-19 should be lower when we account for cases that remain and recover without symptoms . when used with other estimating approaches , our model and our estimates can help disease and policy modelers to obtain more accurate predictions for the epidemiology of the disease and the impact of alternative policy levers to contain this pandemic . the model could also be used with future epidemics to get an early sense of the magnitude of symptomatic infection at the population-level before more direct estimates are available . substantial variation across patient demographics likely exists and should be the focus of future studies .

10000000	comparison of chest ct findings between covid-19 pneumonia and other types of viral pneumonia : a two-center retrospective study . \n\n objectives : to compare the pulmonary chest ct findings of patients with covid-19 pneumonia with those with other types of viral pneumonia . methods : this retrospective review includes 154 patients with rt-pcr-confirmed covid-19 pneumonia diagnosed between february 11 and 20 , 2020 , and 100 patients with other types of viral pneumonia diagnosed between april 2011 and december 2020 from two hospitals . high-resolution ct ( hrct ) of the chest was performed . data on location , distribution , attenuation , maximum lesion range , lobe involvement , number of lesions , air bronchogram signs , hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement , and pleural effusion were collected . associations between imaging characteristics and covid-19 pneumonia were analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression models . results : a peripheral distribution was associated with a 13.04-fold risk of covid-19 pneumonia , compared with a diffuse distribution . a maximum lesion range > 10 cm was associated with a 9.75-fold risk of covid-19 pneumonia , compared with a maximum lesion range < = 5 cm , and the involvement of 5 lobes was associated with an 8.45-fold risk of covid-19 pneumonia , compared with a maximum lesion range < = 2 . no pleural effusion was associated with a 3.58-fold risk of covid-19 pneumonia compared with the presence of pleural effusion . hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement was associated with a 2.79-fold risk of covid-19 pneumonia . conclusion : a peripheral distribution , a lesion range > 10 cm , involvement of 5 lobes , presence of hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement , and no pleural effusion were significantly associated with 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia . key points : a peripheral distribution , a lesion range > 10 cm , involvement of 5 lobes , presence of hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement , and no pleural effusion were significantly associated with covid-19 compared with other types of viral pneumonia . 
00001000	hydatidiform mole in the era of covid-19 pandemic . is there an association ? \n\n in march 2020 , the world health organization considered coronavirus disease-2019 ( covid-19 ) as a worldwide pandemic.1 hydatidiform mole ( hm ) is a non-malignant form of gestational trophoblastic diseases ( gtds ) characterized by failure of fetal development and over proliferation of the trophoblasts.2 in our tertiary care obstetric hospital , we observed a rising incidence of cases diagnosed with hm in synchronization with the onset of covid-19 pandemic . most of cases were primigravidae with no other known risk factors for hm . we tried to put possible explanations for this condition based on the immunological and laboratory parameters of covid-19 disease . 
00011000	the sensitivity and specificity analyses of ambient temperature and population size on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) in different provinces of iran \n\n on 10 april 2020 , iran reported 68,192 covid-19 cumulative cases including 4232 death and 35,465 recovery cases . numerous factors could influence the transmission rate and survival of coronavirus . on this basis and according to the latest epidemiological researches , both ambient temperature ( at ) and population size ( ps ) can be considered as significant transmissibility factors for coronavirus . the analysis of receiver operating characteristics ( roc ) allows measuring the performance of a classification model using the confusion matrix . this study intends to investigate the sensitivity of at and ps on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus in different provinces of iran . for this purpose , the information of each province of iran including the annual average of at and the number of healthy and diseased cases are categorized . subsequently , the sensitivity and specificity analyses of both at and ps factors are performed . the obtained results confirm that at and ps have low sensibility and high sensitivity , respectively . thus , there is no scientific reason to confirm that the number of covid-19 cases in warmer climates is less than that of moderate or cold climates . therefore , it is recommended that the cities/provinces with a population of over 1.7 million people have stricter inspections and more precise controls as their management policy . \n\n graphical abstract \n\n highlights \n\n the population size ( ps ) sensitivity on the spread rate of covid-19 is assessed . \n\n likewise , the ambient temperature ( at ) sensibility is estimated . \n\n the transmission rate of the covid-19 has a low sensibility to the variations of at . \n\n the transmission rate of the covid-19 has a high sensitivity to the variations of ps . \n\n the ps of over 1.7 million can enhance the transmission rate of the covid-19 disease . \n\n introduction \n\n the coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) first manifested itself in wuhan city , hubei province , china . afterward , as an epidemic illness , the coronavirus disease spread swiftly to other provinces of china . finally , covid-19 crossed the boundaries of china and spread to all regions of the world . the data of the world health organization ( who ) show that from 22 january 2020 to 10 april 2020 , almost 1.7 million coronavirus cases have been identified with over 100,000 cases of deaths and 377,000 cases of recovery all over the world ( https : //www.worldometers.info/coronavirus ) . this robust transmission rate of the coronavirus disease has led to the substitution of the epithet 'epidemic ' with 'pandemic ' in the description of this disease . \n\n the coronavirus disease has had a high transmission rate in iran compared with its neighboring countries including bahrain , iraq , kuwait , oman , afghanistan , and pakistan . from 15 february 2020 to 10 april 2020 , iran has acknowledged 68,192 covid-19 cumulative cases encompassing 4232 death and 35,465 recovery cases . although the cumulative statistics of the patients in iran have been reported up to 10 april 2020 , the number of the patients in the provinces is available only until 22 march 2020 ( https : //www.behdasht.gov.ir ) . \n\n many different factors could influence the transmission rate and survival of coronavirus . based on the latest epidemiological researches and laboratory studies , the ambient temperature ( at ) and population size ( ps ) can be considered as the crucial transmissibility factors . for instance , the at and ps parameters could increase or decrease the transmissibility risk and survival period of coronavirus in the air and on surfaces . hence , the sensitivity analyses of at and ps parameters on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus is immensely crucial for improving the safety and survival of mankind . the analysis of the receiver operating characteristics ( roc ) allows measuring the performance of a classification model using the confusion matrix . this research intends to examine the sensibility of at and the sensitivity of ps on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus in different provinces of iran . to this end , the information of each province of iran including the annual average of at and the number of healthy and diseased cases are collected . subsequently , the sensitivity and specificity analyses of both at and ps parameters are performed . \n\n the present work is organized as follows . the materials and data ( including data collection and the study area ) are described in section 2 . the analysis details of the roc curve are presented in section 3 . afterwards , the effectiveness and efficiency of the at and ps parameters on thirty-one numerically simulated provinces of iran are evaluated . moreover , the results of sensitivity and specificity analyses are demonstrated in section 4 . finally , the concluding remarks of this work are summarized in section 5 . \n\n materials and data \n\n data collection \n\n the numbers of daily confirmed cases were collected from the official websites of iran including those of the ministry of health and medical education ( mhme ) ( https : //www.behdasht.gov.ir ) , iran meteorological organization ( imo ) ( http : //www.irimo.ir/far/index.php ) , and the statistical center of iran ( sci ) ( https : //www.amar.org.ir ) . \n\n it is worth mentioning that the number of patients in each province of iran has only been reported until 22 march 2020 , although the cumulative statistics of patients in iran is updated on a daily basis . hereupon , in this research , the statistical data of iran have been collected and classified in each province from 15 february 2020 to 22 march 2020 . \n\n study area \n\n the contour map of the climate zones in iran . \n\n fig . 1 \n\n the islamic republic of iran is a country in western asia with approximately 80 million inhabitants and a territory of 1,648,195 km2 . although iran has only

27 1,776,415 118 0.007 \n\n the statistical data of each province of iran from 15 february 2020 to 22 march 2020 . \n\n table 1 \n\n the statistical data of each province of iran including mean annual at , ps , the number of coronavirus cases ( ncc ) , and the rate of coronavirus cases ( rcc ) from 15 february 2020 to 22 march 2020 have been tabulated in table 1 . from 15 february 2020 to 22 march 2020 , iran has reported 21,638 covid-19 cases including 1685 death and 7783 recovery cases ( https : //www.behdasht.gov.ir ) . as shown in fig . 1 , fig . 2 and table 1 , the maximum values of ps , at , and ncc belong to tehran , hormozgan , and tehran provinces , respectively . moreover , the minimum values of ps , at , and ncc belong to ilam , ardabil , and bushehr provinces , respectively . \n\n the analysis of receiver operating characteristics ( roc ) \n\n the bivariate classification with 4 different combinations of predicted and actual values . \n\n fig . 3 \n\n in statistics , as a probability curve , roc demonstrates the true positive rate ( tpr ) or sensitivity versus the false positive rate ( fpr ) or specificity . in other words , the roc curve is a performance measurement for classification problems at various threshold settings . as a classification model with 4 different combinations of predicted and actual values , the confusion matrix has been depicted in fig . 3 . \n\n tp : the model predicted that a person is sick and it is true . \n\n fp : the model predicted that a person is sick and it is false . \n\n fn : the model predicted that a person is healthy and it is false . \n\n tn : the model predicted that a person is healthy and it is true . \n\n herein tp , fp , fn , and tn represent true positive , false positive , false negative , and true negative , respectively . the explanation of these indices is as follows : \n\n the predicted ( as positive or negative ) and actual ( as true or false ) values have been categorized . sensitivity is defined as the ratio of true positives to all positives . in the same way , specificity is defined as the ratio of true negatives to all negatives . based on the predicted and actual values , the mathematical relationships of sensitivity and specificity have been formulated in eq . ( 1 ) and eq . ( 2 ) , respectively . \n\n the conceptual illustration of the threshold movement in each step . \n\n fig . 4 \n\n in order to calculate the roc curve , the threshold must be moved step by step from 0 to 1 ( see fig . 4 ) . the values higher and lower than the threshold value are classified as predicted positive and negative values , respectively . the sensitivity ( tpr ) and specificity ( fpr ) values have been computed at each threshold , becoming one point on the roc curve . the set of the computed points forms the roc curve for each sensitivity and specificity analysis . \n\n the roc curve . \n\n fig . 5 \n\n as shown in fig . 5 , each roc curve has two main regions ( a1 and a2 ) and three critical points ( p1 through p3 ) . in general , a1 and a2 are the high and low sensitive regions , respectively . the summation of a1 and a2 regions is called the 'area under the curve ' ( auc = a1 + a2 ) . the auc of an ideal model is near 1 which means that it can measure separability in the best way possible . conversely , the auc of an imperfect model is near 0 which implies that it can measure separability in the worst way possible . at p1 , the threshold is more than one and only fn and tn are activated . reciprocally , at p2 , the threshold is less than zero and only tp and fp are activated . in the roc curve , p3 which is called the optimum or cut-off point has the minimum distance from the point ( 0 , 1 ) . this point is considered as the boundary of high ( a1 ) and low ( a2 ) sensitive regions . \n\n the sensitivity and specificity analyses \n\n the sensitivity and specificity analyses of the at and ps variations in all the provinces of iran have been performed in this section . in the roc curves , the sensitivity axis is based on the true positive rate and the specificity axis is based on the true negative rate . in other words , the horizontal axis signifies the design variable and the vertical axis implies the sensitivity of the same variable . \n\n the sensitivity analysis of the transmission rate of coronavirus based on the variations of at in different provinces of iran . \n\n fig . 6 \n\n fig . 6 demonstrates the roc curve of the transmission rate of coronavirus based on the at variations in different provinces of iran . the auc of the at model is approximately 0.5 . it can be observed that the at model has no capacity to distinguish between positive and negative classes . moreover , it can be seen that the behavior of the at model is similar to that of an imperfect model which indicates that the at model does not have a high performance . as marked in fig . 6 , the accurate coordinates of the cut-off or optimum point are p3 ( 0.486 , 0.505 ) . the cut-off point confirms that the spread level of coronavirus in provinces with a temperature of less than 17 c is slightly more than that of the other provinces . it can be concluded that the transmission rate of coronavirus does not have a high sensibility versus the at parameter in different provinces of iran since the at parameter has a linear relationship with the number of people afflicted with covid-19 . therefore , there is no scientific reason to assume that the number of people afflicted with covid-19 in warmer climates is less than that of moderate or cold climates . \n\n the sensitivity analysis of the transmission rate of coronavirus based on the variations of ps in different provinces of iran . \n\n fig . 7 \n\n in both fig . 6 , fig . 7 , the red dash lines are weak models and the aucs of these models are exactly 0.5 . these models predict the patient people as healthy ones and vice versa . the higher the auc , the better the model is able to distinguish between the patient people and the healthy ones . \n\n fig . 7 shows the roc curve of the transmission rate of coronavirus based on the variations of ps in different provinces of iran . the auc of the ps model is approximately 0.8 . it can be understood that the ps model has a relative capacity to distinguish between the positive and negative classes . in contrast to the at model , the ps model has a nonlinear behavior which indicates that it has a higher sensitivity than the at model . therefore , it can be deduced that the transmission rate of coronavirus has a high sensitivity to the ps parameter in different provinces of iran since it has a nonlinear relationship with the number of people afflicted with covid-19 . as marked in fig . 7 , the precise coordinates of the cut-off or optimum point are p3 ( 0.274 , 0.686 ) . the cut-off point confirms that the transmission rate of coronavirus in provinces with a population of over 1.7 million people is more than that of the other provinces . according to the findings of the current paper , it is recommended that the cities/provinces with a population of over 1.7 million people have stricter inspections and more precise controls as their management policy . \n\n conclusions \n\n in this research , the sensibility of the at parameter and the sensitivity of the ps parameter on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus were investigated in different provinces of iran . to evaluate the effectiveness of both the at and ps parameters , their roc curves were analyzed . \n\n the obtained results indicated that the at parameter had a linear relationship with the number of people afflicted with covid-19 in different provinces of iran and that the transmission rate of coronavirus did not have a high sensibility to it . thus , there is no scientific reason to assume that the number of people afflicted with covid-19 in warmer climates is less than that of moderate or cold climates . reciprocally , the ps parameter had a nonlinear relationship with the number of people afflicted with covid-19 in different provinces of iran and the transmission rate of coronavirus had a high sensitivity to it . based on the findings of the current research , it is suggested that the cities/provinces with a population of more than 1.7 million people have stricter inspections and more precise controls as their management policy . \n\n declaration of competing interest \n\n the

00001000	coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) outbreak in iran : actions and problems \n\n to the editor : coronaviruses ( cov ) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers-cov ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars-cov ) . investigations have shown that sars-cov was transmitted from civet cats to humans and mers-cov from dromedary camels to humans . coronaviruses are present in humans and many different species of animals , including camels , cattle , cats , and bats . rarely , animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as mers-cov , sars-cov , and the new virus named sars-cov-2 . \n\n the sars-cov-2 coronavirus was first detected in china , and the disease it causes has been named `` coronavirus disease 2019 , '' which is abbreviated `` covid-19 . '' common signs of this infection include respiratory symptoms , fever , cough , shortness of breath , and breathing difficulties . in more severe cases , infection can cause pneumonia , severe acute respiratory syndrome , kidney failure , and even death . \n\n coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) was first reported from wuhan , china , on december 31 , 2019 , and is now a concerning issue in the world especially in iran , south korea , and italy . in iran , on february 19 , 2020 , two patients in qom city were confirmed as sars-cov-2 positive . afterward , the disease spread very rapidly in adjacent provinces near qom , such as tehran , markazi , isfahan , and semnan provinces , and shortly thereafter in all 31 provinces of the country . by march 8 , 2020 , according to dr. jahanpour , spokesman for the ministry of health and medical education , the total number of infected people who tested positive for sars-cov-2 had reached 6,566 and covid-19 deaths had reached 194 . although these data continue to change , they show that the mortality rate has been ~2.9 % in covid-19-positive cases . at the time of article submission , iran ranked third in the number of people suffering from the disease after china and south korea and second in the number of deaths and recovered cases . \n\n wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water . \n\n maintain at least 1 m ( 3 feet ) distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing . \n\n avoid touching eyes , nose , or mouth with contaminated hands . \n\n practice respiratory hygiene by covering mouth and nose with bent elbow , facial masks , or tissue when you cough or sneeze . \n\n seek medical care early at the onset of fever , cough , and/or difficulty breathing . \n\n increased awareness and informed people about covid-19 and recommended protective measures proposed by the world health organization ( who ) through media such as television , radio , etc , including the following recommendations : \n\n restricted traffic in busy areas such as places of pilgrimage , tourism , and markets . \n\n closed kindergartens , schools , and universities . \n\n reduced office working hours . \n\n cancelled the congregational prayer and jumu'ah prayer ( friday prayer ) . \n\n cancelled all multiplayer sport matches like football and volleyball . \n\n disinfected busy places such as bus stops , subways , and bus rapid transits ( brts ) . \n\n limited access and identification of people suspected of having covid-19 at the entrance and exit of a number of cities . \n\n created groups and teams to diagnose the disease through district health centers located in different areas of the affected cities . \n\n according to officials of the iranian ministry of health and medical education ( mhme ) , in the coming days the number of positive cases and deaths will increase . thus , the issue of the covid-19 outbreak and its control has become a top priority for the mhme . iran formed the national committee to combat corona and has decided to control this infection using all resources of the country , especially the knowledge , equipment , and skilled personnel . the mhme has initiated the following actions to combat the disease : \n\n lack of adequate infrastructure and per capita hospital beds and equipment in some cities . \n\n inadequate protective equipment such as facial masks , disinfectants , and antiseptics such as alcohol . \n\n difficulty importing some essential medicines . \n\n difficulty of strategies such as quarantining cities due to the wide distribution of the virus throughout the country . \n\n increased risk of virus transmission caused by increased travel due to the new year holiday ( nowruz , march 19 , 2020 ) and related vacations . \n\n despite these decisions and actions , many problems remain for iran in confronting and defeating in the covid-19 outbreak , including the following : \n\n iran is now fighting covid-19 with all its might , but the wide spread of the disease in all the provinces of the country has made it extremely difficult to control , and iran has required assistance from international organizations such as the world health organization . the increase in travel related to the nowruz holiday , which started even 15 days earlier due to the closure of schools and universities , increases the likelihood of transmission and circulation of the virus and increased prevalence of covid-19 . to effectively fight this serious disease , the government should take more stringent measures to significantly limit travel instead of simply advising citizens to stay at home . \n\n references \n\n . world health organization website . . published 2020 . accessed march 24 , 2020 . \n\n\n\n . . updated 2020 .

00001000	editorial . endonasal neurosurgery during the covid-19 pandemic : the singapore perspective \n\n singapore was among the first nations to be affected by the covid-19 pandemic , with our first case reported on january 23 , 2020 . up until mid-february , singapore reported the highest number of covid-19 cases outside of china . singapore has adopted a risk calibration and mitigation approach , which broadly speaking consists of the following : scaled screening in designated community clinics ; targeted testing of suspected cases ; extensive contact tracing of confirmed cases ; a combination of isolation ( `` stay-home notices '' ) and quarantine measures ( in supervised , designated venues ) for high-risk individuals such as returnees from high-prevalence countries and individuals identified through contact tracing ; social distancing measures ; and free diagnostic tests and treatment in public hospitals for local residents . at present , the prevalence of community transmission in singapore remains low , and the risk of transmission in the local asymptomatic population without relevant travel history is correspondingly low . \n\n in neurosurgery , aerosol-generating procedures ( agps ) such as endonasal and anterior skull base surgery present the highest risk for covid-19 exposure . endonasal agps theoretically present a higher risk of viral exposure than intubation due to the aggressive disruption of potentially virus-containing mucosa . the duration of exposure for these procedures is also longer than during intubation . common high-risk agps in neurosurgery include endoscopic endonasal pituitary surgery as well as anterior skull base procedures with the potential to breach the paranasal sinuses . viral shedding has been found to be higher in the upper respiratory tract and , once aerosolized , virus particles remain airborne for more than 3 hours . a high rate of infection has been reported among ear , nose , and throat ( ent ) surgeons performing upper airway procedures . endonasal surgery with the use of power tools should mandate the use of adequate protection due to potentially prolonged exposure to a high viral load . neurosurgery and ent departments across the nation have jointly developed advisories for these agps , in consultation with the infectious disease and anesthesia departments , and the hospitals ' surgical division committee . \n\n preoperative covid-19 screening \n\n prior to surgery and admission , for both outpatients and those transferring from another hospital , a comprehensive screening questionnaire is administered to review a list of symptoms and exposure history to identify patients who may be infected . routine preoperative chest radiography is performed in all patients , and any suspicious findings are discussed with a dedicated on-call covid-19 infectious disease team . \n\n all patients who require elective high-risk surgery ( defined as surgery that transgresses the upper airways ) should undergo a routine preoperative swab for covid-19 the day before surgery , regardless of risk status . once a patient tests negative for covid-19 , an n95 mask , eye protection ( goggles and/or full face shield ) , and standard personal protective equipment ( ppe ; i.e. , gown and gloves ) will suffice for agps . surgery for those who test positive for covid-19 should be postponed until test results are negative , where possible . however , due to laboratory constraints in the face of the extremely large number of suspect cases , the capacity for routine swabs is not always available . \n\n covid-19-positive patients \n\n informal uk and us advisories have recommended the use of powered , air-purifying respirators ( paprs ) for all operating room staff during conduct of high-risk agps , and have suggested that an n95 mask and eye protection may not offer full protection . this was based on reports from wuhan , china , that there was a high infection rate among ent surgeons , and that the use of paprs anecdotally reduced the rate of transmission . a caveat was that the reports were not specific about whether the transmissions occurred during the actual surgery or during other perioperative phases ( e.g. , intubation , extubation , postoperative period ) . our local consensus from infectious disease input is that for agps , even in covid-19-positive patients , a properly fitted , molded , and handled n95 mask ; eye protection ( goggles/full face shield ) ; and standard ppe ( gown and gloves ) should be adequate . nevertheless , because there is uncertainty over the exact mechanisms of virus transmission , degree of aerosolization , amount of viral load exposure , and lack of data on appropriate ppe in endonasal agps , a more cautious stance was adopted in which the entire surgical and anesthetic team would don paprs during the surgery , with the exception of the circulating nurse and operating theater attendant . intraoperatively , the use of power instruments is avoided as much as is feasible without compromising the surgical exposure : using rongeurs and chisels instead . we also avoid the use of nasal packing or pledgets , which will need to be removed in the postoperative phase , because removal may induce coughing or gagging . \n\n patients whose covid-19 status is unknown \n\n personal protective measures for patients with unknown covid-19 status generated more debate . the safety of operating surgeons should be placed at the highest priority , although current resource limitation ( or potential for such in the future ) should also be taken into consideration to achieve a balance . where possible , elective endonasal surgeries that are aerosol-generating should be deferred . for patients who do require urgent surgery , they should be assumed to be covid-19-positive until proven otherwise , and managed accordingly . in accordance with this , the minimum ppe worn should be an n95 mask with goggles and standard ppe , but we recommend the use of paprs ( where feasible and available ) for the surgical team due to their closest proximity to the patient ( figs . 1 and 2 ) . this is to mitigate the low but possible risk of operating on asymptomatic covid-19-positive patients , which will increase as community prevalence increases , and in the absence of preoperative covid-19 testing . for procedures in which headlight and loupes are required , alternative models of the papr such as the cleanspace halo may be used . \n\n schema of operating room disposition during conduct of endonasal surgery for suspected covid-19 cases . the operating surgeons and scrub nurse should don paprs , because they work in the immediate vicinity of the patient , whereas other personnel should don n95 masks , goggles , and standard ppe ( gown and gloves ) . the anesthetist dons a papr during intubation and extubation but wears an n95 mask , goggles , and standard ppe during the surgery . figure is available in color online only . \n\n photograph showing implementation of ppe in the operating room . figure is available in color online only . \n\n aerosolization from the use of power instruments in contact with blood or bone , not just respiratory mucosa , has been postulated to present a small risk of viral transmission . one percent of blood specimens in a chinese series contained detectable viral rna . these considerations have wider implications for the rest of neurosurgery and other surgical specialties . given finite resources , extensive testing and/or use of ppe will not be practical . all elective procedures should be postponed to minimize this theoretical risk as much as possible . power drills should be irrigated more meticulously to minimize aerosolization . \n\n future directions \n\n the covid-19 pandemic is an evolving situation and guidelines should change in light of new evidence in the future . preparations should be made for the future should covid-19 turn endemic . the total number of expected agps needs to be forecast within an institution to determine the required number of papr units . the measures proposed should be proportional to the level of risk , and take into consideration country-specific resource constraints . most importantly , in the long haul , there is a need for healthcare workers to feel safe psychologically and to work in a safe environment . \n\n disclosures \n\n the authors report no conflict of interest . \n\n references \n\n investigation of three clusters of covid-19 in singapore : implications for surveillance and response measures \n\n coronavirus disease ( covid-2019 ) situation reports \n\n sars-cov-2 viral load in upper respiratory specimens of infected patients \n\n aerosol and surface stability of sars-cov-2 as compared with sars-cov-1 \n\n europe 's doctors repeat errors made in wuhan , china medics say \n\n rational use of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) for coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) : interim guidance \n\n covid-19 and the risk to health care workers : a case report \n\n detection of sars-cov-2 in different types of clinical specimens 
00001000	effect of covid-19 related lockdown on ophthalmic practice and patient care in india : results of a survey . \n\n purpose : in early 2020 , the world health organization declared the outbreak of the disease covid-19 , caused by a new variant of coronavirus 2019-ncov as a global pandemic . the government of india ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days , limiting movement of people as a preventive measure . this survey was designed and conducted during the lockdown period to assess its effect on ophthalmic practice and patient care in india . methods : an online survey was sent across to practicing indian ophthalmologists across through various social media platforms . all valid responses were tabulated and analyzed . results : a total of 1260 ophthalmologists responded to the survey . most of the respondents ( 775/1260 ; 61.5 % ) were in private practice and 14.8 % ( 187/1260 ) were affiliated to ophthalmic institutes . at the time of taking the survey , 72.5 % of the respondents ( 913/1260 ) were not seeing any patients due to the lockdown . of those who were still examining patients , 82.9 % ( 287/347 ) were only seeing emergency cases , based on their own clinical judgement . the proportion of ophthalmologists in ophthalmic institutes , government and municipal hospitals ( 126/253 ; 49.8 % ) who were still seeing patients was significantly higher ( p < 0.0001 ) than those in private practice ( 174/775 ; 22.4 % ) . apart from emergencies such as trauma , retinal detachment , and endophthalmitis ( 81.8 % ) , other surgeries that were still being performed included intravitreal injections ( 9.1 % ) and cataract surgeries ( 5.9 % ) . approximately , 77.5 % ( 976/1260 ) of the respondents had begun telephonic/e-mail/video consultations or consultations over social media applications since the lockdown began . in addition , 59.1 % ( 745/1260 ) felt that ophthalmologists were potentially at a higher risk of contracting covid-19 compared to other specialties while examining patients . when asked about the resumption of practice upon easing off of the restrictions , 57.8 % ( 728/1260 ) of the respondents said they were unsure of when to resume elective surgeries ; furthermore , 62.8 % ( 791/1260 ) were unsure about the preferred screening strategy or precautionary approach prior to resuming surgeries and were awaiting guidelines . conclusion : our survey shows that majority of ophthalmologists in india were not seeing patients during the covid-19 lockdown , with near-total cessation of elective surgeries . emergency services were still being attended to by 27.5 % of ophthalmologists who responded . a large proportions of ophthalmologists had switched over to telephonic advice or other forms of telemedicine to assist patients . most of the responding ophthalmologists were unclear about when and how to resume surgeries upon easing off of the covid-19 related restrictions . regulatory bodies should take note of this and issue appropriate guidelines regarding the same . 
11000000	epidemiological analysis of covid-19 and practical experience from china \n\n abstract \n\n the rapid spread of the epidemic has aroused widespread concern in the international community . severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) originated from wuhan 's huanan wholesale seafood market , with bats as the likely original hosts and pangolins as potential intermediate hosts . the current source of the disease is mainly patients infected with sars-cov-2 . patients in the incubation period may also become sources of infection . the virus is mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets and contact , and the population is generally susceptible . the epidemic has progressed through the local outbreak stage and community transmission stage due to exposure at wuhan 's huanan wholesale seafood market and is now in the stage of large-scale transmission due to the spread of the epidemic . the basic productive number ( r0 ) at the beginning of the epidemic was 2.2 , with an average incubation period of 5.2 days . the proportion of critically ill patients was 23.4 % , the mortality rate was lower than those of sars and middle east respiratory syndrome , and 96.5 % of deaths occurred in hubei province , where the outbreak occurred first . among them , elderly men with underlying diseases had a higher mortality rate . chinese medical staff have summarized a set of effective strategies and methods in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease that are worthy of reference for their international counterparts . with powerful government intervention and the efforts of chinese medical staff , china 's outbreak has gradually improved . \n\n research highlights \n\n the current source of the disease is mainly patients infected with sars-cov-2 . patients in the incubation period may also become sources of infection . \n\n the virus is mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets and contact , and the population is generally susceptible . \n\n the proportion of critically ill patients was 23.4 % , the mortality rate was lower than those of sars and middle east respiratory syndrome . among them , elderly men with underlying diseases had a higher mortality rate . \n\n introduction \n\n since december 2019 , patients with unexplained pneumonia have been found in wuhan , hubei province , china . 1 on 7 january 2020 , chinese authorities confirmed that the cause was a novel coronavirus that had not been previously identified , different from other coronaviruses , such as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) in 2012 to 2015 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) in 2003 . on 12 january 2020 , the world health organization ( who ) temporarily named this new virus 2019 novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov ) . with the spread of the disease , novel coronavirus cases have been found in other parts of china and other countries in the world . as an ongoing coronavirus outbreak , the chinese government has paid great attention to this situation . on 21 january 2020 , the national health commission of the people 's republic of china announced 2019-ncov pneumonia as a category b infectious disease , and preventive and control measures were taken according to category a infectious disease . \n\n on 30 january 2020 , the who declared that the 2019-ncov epidemic constitutes a public health emergency of international concern . soon after that , the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia was officially named `` covid-19 '' ( coronavirus disease 2019 ) by the who on 11 february 2020 . at the same time , the international virus classification commission announced that the novel coronavirus was named `` sars-cov-2 . '' with the development of pathogenic testing and the continuous accumulation of clinical cases , people have acquired a certain degree of knowledge and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease . this article presents the currently known epidemiological characteristics , clinical manifestations , laboratory findings , and experiences in the prevention and treatment of covid-19 , providing references for the prevention and treatment of this disease . \n\n source of infection \n\n sars-cov-2 is the seventh type of coronavirus isolated in humans . this coronavirus belongs to the genus beta and has an envelope ; its particles are round or oval , often polymorphic , and 60 to 140 nm in diameter . the genetic characteristics of sars-cov-2 are significantly different from those of sars-cov and mers-cov . current research shows that sars-cov-2 has more than 85 % homology with bat sars-like coronavirus ( bat-sl-cov zc45 ) . 2 therefore , it is now believed that the original host of sars-cov-2 may have been rhinolophus sinicus . 3 a study team from south china agricultural university pointed out that pangolins may be one of the intermediate hosts of sars-cov-2 , through which the virus may spread to humans . relevant research teams are being organized by the chinese government to further support this view . the outbreak is considered to be closely related to wuhan 's huanan wholesale seafood market . 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 epidemiological surveys have shown that 27 of 41 people with the earliest onset have visited the market . 8 post hoc investigations also revealed that there was a wildlife trade in this market , and sars-cov-2 has also been isolated from the market 's environment . human-to-human transmission emerged shortly thereafter . 9 patients with covid-19 have become the main source of infection . covid-19 may be capable of transmission during the incubation period . 10 , 11 these patients are difficult to diagnose and isolate in time , which causes great difficulties in the prevention and control of the disease . however , up to date , there is no enough evidence to support the role of asymptomatic patients in the transmission of covid-19 . in addition , the presence of the virus can be detected in patients during the recovery stage , especially in fecal specimens requiring longer detoxification times , indicating the possible risk of fecal-oral transmission . 11 sars-cov-2 is a positive-stranded rna virus that is susceptible to gene mutation and recombination , but so far , no significant mutations have been found in humans or the environment . 2 , 12 \n\n method of spread \n\n at present , droplets inhaled into the respiratory tract and contact transmission are considered to be the most important routes of transmission . there is no direct evidence showing that covid-19 can be transmitted through aerosols . the who believes that further evidence is needed to assess the possibility of aerosol transmission . however , some of the observations suggest that aerosol propagation is possible under the condition of long exposure to high concentrations of aerosols in a relatively closed environment . in the early stages of the outbreak of sars-cov-2 pneumonia , it is uncertain whether stool samples from patients are infectious . however , lu et al , 2 using a computer structural simulation , found that the s-protein of sars-cov-2 can bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) in the spatial conformation . after that , letko et al 13 synthesized the s-protein of sars and the receptor-binding domain ( rbd ) of sars-cov-2 in vitro and reacted with known human coronavirus receptors , respectively . as a result , the rbd of sars-cov-2 is similar to the s protein in sars , and it can directly bind to human ace2 . ace2 is a metalloproteinase belonging to a type i transmembrane glycoprotein , and it can be expressed in the small intestine . 14 , 15 in our laboratory , it was also found that nucleic acid amplification testing of stool samples can still be positive for a long time after oral swab samples become negative . in addition , a large number of clinical studies have shown that a certain proportion of sars-cov-2 pneumonia patients develop symptoms of diarrhea . 10 , 16 it can be concluded that during the development of the disease , there is a greater possibility of the virus in the stool . recently , sars-cov-2 has been isolated from the stool of confirmed patients in wuhan and shenzhen , china , and in the united states , 17 indicating that the virus can replicate and survive in the digestive tract . however , it is not clear whether the infection and transmission are caused by eating food contaminated with the virus . through the analysis of the current epidemic situation , some scholars believe that viruses in feces may be retransmitted by the aerosol formation of virus-containing droplets . sars-cov-2 also has adverse effects on fetuses and infants , including restricted intrauterine growth , premature birth , spontaneous abortion , and perinatal death . 18 however , the possibility of intrauterine mother-to-child transmission of covid-19 is very low , and neither of the two existing retrospective clinical studies have found direct evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission . 19 , 20 \n\n susceptible individuals \n\n covid-19 is an emerging infectious disease , so the population is not immune and is generally susceptible . a report 16 delineated 1099 patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/province-level municipalities of china and found that the median age was 47.0 years old ( interquartile range [ iqr ] : 35.0-58.0 ) and that 41.9 % of patients were females . sars-cov-2 pneumonia was diagnosed throughout the whole spectrum of age . a total of 0.9 % of patients were aged below 15 years old . another chinese analysis of 4021 confirmed cases showed that people of all ages were generally susceptible . the study found that 71.45 % of patients were 30 to 65 years old , and children under 10 years old accounted for 0.35 % . 21 those in close contact with patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia , including the family members of patients , are at high risk for developing the sars-cov-2 infection . medical staff who treat patients also have a high risk of infection . nine percent of the patients admitted to zhongnan hospital of wuhan university from 1 to 28 january 2020 , were the medical staff . 22 by the end of 29 january 2020 , survey data from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces in china showed that the infection rate of medical staff was as high as 2.09 % . 16 \n\n mortality \n\n according to a who report , as of 23 march 2020 , the world has reported 332 930 confirmed cases of covid-19 , including 81 601 cases in china and 251 329 cases in other countries outside china . the average mortality rate in china was 4.0 % ( 3276/81 601 ) , while the average mortality rate outside china was 4.5 % ( 11 233/251 329 ) . hubei province , the worst-affected province in china , had an average mortality rate of 4.7 % ( 3160/67 801 ) . the area in hubei province with higher-than-average mortality rates in hubei province was wuhan ( 5.0 % , 2524/50 006 ) . \n\n the mortality rates in other severely affected provinces in china were relatively lower than those in hubei province , with mortality rates of 0.6 % ( 8/1428 ) in guangdong , 1.7 % ( 22/1274 ) in henan , 0.1 % ( 1/1240 ) in zhejiang , and 0.4 % ( 4/1018 ) in hunan . the above results are shown in figures 1 , 2 , 3 . according to the available data , the mortality rate of covid-19 in china is lower than those of sars ( 10 % ) 23 and mers ( 40 % ) . 24 by 23 march 2020 , 96.5 % ( 3160/3276 ) of the deaths caused by sars-cov-2 pneumonia in china was in hubei province , and the earlier the onset of disease was , the higher the mortality rate , suggesting that the pathogenicity may gradually decrease as the virus spreads , which may also occur because of the improving ability of medical staff to diagnose and treat the disease . the national health commission of china notified on 4 february 2020 , that the population is generally susceptible to the virus , and more than 80 % of the deaths are elderly people over 60 years old ; at the same time , more than 75 % of the deaths have underlying diseases . overall , men are linked to a higher risk of death . the specific data in this section are shown in table 1 . \n\n distribution of coronavirus disease 2019 cases as of 23 march

health emergency response . it can be used for unrestricted research re-use and analysis in any form or by any means with acknowledgement of the original source , for the duration of the public health emergency . \n\n a single-centered , retrospective , observational study from one hospital of wuhan 29 found among 52 critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 infection , 32 ( 61 5 % ) patients had died at 28 days , and the median duration from intensive care unit admission to death was 7 ( iqr : 3-11 ) days in the nonsurvivors . compared with survivors , nonsurvivors were more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) ( 26 [ 81 % ] vs 9 [ 45 % ] ) and were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation ( 30 [ 94 % ] vs 7 [ 35 % ] ) . a total of 30 ( 81 % ) of 37 patients requiring mechanical ventilation had died by 28 days . \n\n according to the data , 30 by 11 february 2020 , among the 422 medical institutions involved in the diagnosis and treatment of sars-cov-2 pneumonia in china , a total of 1716 medical workers were diagnosed with confirmed sars-cov-2 pneumonia . among the 1688 confirmed cases with severity grading data , 87.3 % ( 1474/1688 ) of the infected medical staff were in hubei province , and 10.4 % of the infected medical staff were seriously ill. a total of 64.0 % ( 1080/1688 ) of new coronavirus infections among medical workers occurred in wuhan , and the proportion of critically ill patients was 17.7 % . medical workers in other parts of china accounted for 12.7 % ( 214/1688 ) , with a proportion of critically ill patients of 7.0 % . the proportion of critically ill patients among medical workers in wuhan has gradually decreased from a peak of 38.9 % to 12.7 % by early february 2020 . the average mortality rate for the 1688 diagnosed medical staff was 0.3 % . \n\n epidemiological characteristics \n\n the spread of sars-cov-2 pneumonia in china can be roughly divided into three stages : 55 % of the patients who developed symptoms before the end of december 2019 are related to the exposure at wuhan 's huanan wholesale seafood market ; therefore , the first stage of epidemic transmission mainly occurred in a local outbreak among people with a direct contact history at the seafood market . only 8.6 % of the patients who became ill after 1 january 2020 , had a history of exposure to wuhan 's huanan wholesale seafood market , suggesting that the epidemic of sars-cov-2 pneumonia had now shifted to the second stage : the community dissemination stage . 31 interpersonal and cluster transmission occurred in multiple communities and families in wuhan during this period . 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 10 \n\n 25 january 2020 was chinese new year , also known as the spring festival , which is the most important festival in china . with the festival approaching , a large number of migrant workers and people new to wuhan began to leave wuhan to travel to their hometowns in other provinces in china for family reunions or to start a vacation in other countries . with the movement of people , the epidemic quickly spread to other parts of china and other countries around the world and reached the stage of large-scale transmission , causing widespread concern in the international community . 32 , 33 \n\n a retrospective study of 425 patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia at the beginning of the epidemic before 22 january 2020 , found that the average incubation period of the disease was 5.2 days ( 95 % confidence interval : 4.1-7.0 ) and the p95 was 12.5 days ; in the early stages , the epidemic doubling time was 7.4 days , which means the number of infections doubled every 7.4 days ; the r0 was estimated to be 2.2 ( which means infecting two healthy people for every sick person ) . 31 additionally , the who assessed the r0 of this epidemic as between 1.4 and 2.5 . 7 \n\n clinical features \n\n at the beginning of the outbreak , the average time from onset to the first visit and the average time from onset to hospitalization was 5.8 and 12.5 days , respectively ( for patients who developed the disease before 1 january 2020 ) , and 4.6 and 9.1 days , respectively ( for patients who developed disease between 1 and 11 january 2020 ) . 31 a retrospective analysis of approximately 4021 confirmed sars-cov-2 pneumonia patients from various regions in china found that the average time from onset to confirmed diagnosis was 5 days , and this time window was getting shorter as the epidemic progresses . 21 the confirmed times for patients who developed the disease before 14 january , during 14 to 22 january , and after 22 january were 14 , 6 , and 1 day , respectively . \n\n this shows that with the development of the epidemic situation , the diagnostic ability of chinese medical staff is rapidly improving . the average time from symptom onset to the hospitalization of critically ill patients was 7 days , and the average time from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis was 8 days , which was significantly longer than that of mildly ill patients . the average time from symptom onset to confirmed diagnosis in death cases was 9 days , and the average time interval from symptom onset to death was 9.5 days . therefore , early detection , early diagnosis , and early treatment are effective methods for reducing the severity and mortality of the disease . 21 \n\n based on the analysis of existing retrospective studies , 6 , 8 , 16 , 22 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 the main manifestations of sars-cov-2 pneumonia patients were fever ( 89.6 % , 1563/1745 ) and dry cough ( 67.0 % , 1170/1745 ) . additionally , a small number of patients had symptoms such as the stuffy nose , runny nose , sore throat , myalgia , and diarrhea . a total of 90.2 % ( 1157/1283 ) of patients had normal or decreased leukocyte counts , 73.4 % ( 982/1337 ) of patients had decreased lymphocyte counts , and 81.2 % ( 1119/1378 ) of patients had abnormal pulmonary imaging . it can be seen that patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia had a fever and/or respiratory symptoms ; in the early stages of onset , the white blood cells were normal or reduced , or with lymphocytopenia ; the proportion of abnormalities on chest computed tomography or x-ray was high . 34 therefore , meeting two of the above three clinical manifestations at the same time with an epidemiological history , or both conforming to the above three clinical manifestations was presented as the diagnostic criteria for suspected cases in china 's guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 . if the suspected case has a positive result for a nucleic acid amplification assay or serological evidence ( immunoglobulin m [ igm ] antibody specific to sars-cov-2 was detected 3-5 days after onset , or the titer of igg antibody specific to sars-cov-2 was increased by four times or more in the recovery period compared with the acute phase ) , the case can be classified as confirmed . according to statistics , the proportion of critically ill patients among the confirmed cases is approximately 23.4 % ( 1198/5120 ) . 16 , 21 the above results are shown in table 1 . most of the 14 cases in children reported in the existing literature ( table 2 ) had an epidemiological history related to wuhan , and almost all had family members that were confirmed patients . except for one child who failed to see a doctor in time , the others were all in mild condition . among the seven cases reported in the existing literature outside china , except for one case where the patient died , the remaining cases were in stable condition ( table 3 ) . \n\n patient 135 patient 236 patient 336 patient 437 patient 538 patient 638 patient 739 patient 839 patient 939 patient 1046 patient 1139

with sars-cov-2 pneumonia have recovered and been discharged . hubei and wuhan reported no new confirmed or suspected cases for 5 consecutive days , and the number of confirmed cases continued to drop . these results indicate that china 's preventions and treatments against covid-19 have achieved good results . in the past month or so , china has issued a series of national recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infections caused by sars-cov-2 . 45 these recommendations have now been updated to version 7 . recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infection caused by sars-cov-2 in children were also drafted by the national clinical research center for child health , children 's hospital , zhejiang university school of medicine , to further standardize the protocol for diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infection in children caused by sars-cov-2 . 46 chinese medical workers have gradually formed some effective diagnosis and treatment strategies and methods in clinical practice of antiviral therapy and symptomatic treatment , including a comprehensive series of diagnosis and treatment methods such as respiratory support , circulatory support , and immunity improvement , to accelerate recovery . 47 antiviral drugs ( ganciclovir , acyclovir , and ribavirin ) and neuraminidase inhibitors ( oseltamivir , paramivir , zanamivir , etc ) commonly used in clinical practice , are ineffective on covid-19 and are not recommended . drugs that are possibly effective on covid-19 include remdesivir , lopinavir/ritonavir , lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon-beta , convalescent plasma , and monoclonal antibodies . 48 however , the efficacy and safety of these drugs for sars-cov-2 pneumonia patients need to be assessed by further clinical trials . chinese researchers recently discovered that the anti-malarial drug chloroquine phosphate has an effect on the treatment of sars-cov-2 pneumonia through drug screening and clinical trials . preliminary evidence suggests that chloroquine phosphate can significantly reduce the exacerbation rate of patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia , has an antipyretic function , can accelerate pulmonary inflammation recovery , shorten the negative time and increase the negative conversion rate of viral nucleic acids , and shorten the course of the disease . in addition , chloroquine phosphate is relatively safe , and no serious adverse reactions related to the drug have been found so far . the drug has been included in the latest edition of the chinese diagnosis and treatment guidelines for sars-cov-2 pneumonia treatment updated on 3 march 2020 , to expand the scope of clinical trials . however , the efficacy of this drug should be further evaluated in clinical application . use should be discontinued when there is an intolerable side effect . patients with covid-19 treated with chloroquine phosphate must have a normal electrocardiogram before medication . the combination uses chloroquine phosphate with macrolides including azithromycin or other drugs that may cause a prolonged qt interval are prohibited in china . however , a study from france showed that azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination in covid-19 patients . in this study , among hydroxychloroquine-treated patients six patients received azithromycin to prevent bacterial super-infection under daily electrocardiogram control , 100 % of patients were virologicaly cured . 49 although the study sample size was small , the results require further confirmation . however , the study offers an insight : whether this compound could be useful as chemoprophylaxis to prevent the transmission of the virus , especially for health care workers . \n\n the principle of treatment for severe and critically ill cases is to actively prevent and treat complications , treat underlying diseases , prevent infection , and provide timely organ function support based on symptomatic treatment ; clinical warning indicators and early intervention for patients were explored to reduce mortality ; additionally , new treatments such as convalescent plasma therapy were developed . the convalescent plasma therapy was developed using a virus-free plasma containing high-titer sars-cov-2 specific antibodies donated from rehabilitated patients . this therapy will be applied clinically after virus inactivation , antibody titer determination , and multiple pathogenic microorganism determination . on 22 january the chinese research group incorporated the preparation of exempt plasma from rehabilitated sars-cov-2 pneumonia patients into the scientific research emergency project . the first plasma from patients with a recovery period was collected on 1 february 2020 , and coronavirus-free plasma was then prepared . on 9 february 2020 , the first severely ill patient received sars-cov-2-free plasma treatment at a hospital in wuhan , and more patients subsequently received the therapy . clinical studies have shown that sars-cov-2-free plasma is safe and effective for critically ill patients . the therapeutic method has been added to the latest guidelines ( version 6 ) for critically ill patients . in addition , china has organized several research groups to explore the role of chinese medicine in the prevention and treatment of covid-19 and has achieved a certain effect . \n\n zhejiang province is one of the provinces with the largest number of sars-cov-2 pneumonia patients in china . as of 23 march 2020 , a total of 1240 patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia were diagnosed , of which 1193 recovered and were discharged . the most important thing is that to date , only one patient has died from sars-cov-2 infection in this province . the medical staff in this province have formed a unique `` zhejiang experience '' . ( a ) within 72 hours of disease onset , a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir/abidol and interferon nebulization is used for antiviral treatment to reduce the damage to the cells caused by viral expansion and replication . ( b ) glucocorticoids are mainly used in critically ill patients suffering inflammatory cytokine storm . inhibition of excessive inflammation through timely administration of glucocorticoids in the early stage of inflammatory cytokine storm effectively prevents the occurrence of ards and protects the functions of the patients ' organs . for patients with progressive deterioration of oxygenation indicators , rapid imaging progress , and excessive inflammatory response , the use of glucocorticoid in the short term ( 3-5 days ) is appropriate , and the recommended dose is no more than equivalent to methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/d . some critically ill patients should use methods , such as , artificial liver and plasma exchange to block the cytokine storm . ( c ) effective oxygen therapy is performed for patients . ( d ) infection is actively prevented . ( e ) nutritional support is strengthened . \n\n risk factors for disease progression from ordinary covid-19 to several cases \n\n in clinical practice , some mild patients can quickly progress to critical patients . some characteristics of these patients were summarized in the diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 ( trial version 7 ) from china . in adults , the following conditions indicate a worsening of the disease . ( a ) progressive decline of peripheral blood lymphocytes ; ( b ) peripheral inflammatory factors , such as interleukin 6 and c-reactive protein , increased progressively . ( c ) progressive increase of lactic acid ; ( d ) intrapulmonary lesions progress rapidly in a short period of time . \n\n children with the following conditions are prone to develop into critical cases . ( a ) increased respiratory rate ; ( b ) poor mental response and lethargy ; ( c ) progressive increase of lactic acid ; ( d ) imaging findings showed bilateral or multilobular infiltration , pleural effusion , or rapid progression in the short term ; ( e ) infants under 3 months of age or have underlying diseases ( congenital heart disease , pulmonary dysplasia of the airway , malformation of the respiratory tract , abnormal hemoglobin , severe malnutrition , etc ) , or have immunodeficiency ( long-term use of immunosuppressive agents ) . \n\n reappearance of nucleic acid of covid-19 patients after discharge from hospitals \n\n after treatment , covid-19 patients can be discharged if they meet the following conditions : temperature returns to normal for more than 3 days ; respiratory symptoms improve significantly ; pulmonary imaging shows significant improvement of acute exudative lesions ; negative nucleic acid test of respiratory tract specimens , such as sputum and nasopharyngeal swab , for two consecutive times ( sampling time should be at least 24 hours apart ) . however , it is now found that about 0.1 % of patients will be tested positive for nucleic acid again after discharge . 50 there are many reasons for the positive nucleic acid test of discharged patients . 51 the reagent itself , detection method , sampling method , and so on will affect the positive rate . in addition , the possibility of disease recurrence can not be ruled out too . genomic analysis of the virus from different regions , different periods and different sources of patients revealed that sars-cov-2 was stable and showed no major variation . so once the patient is cured with immunity against the virus , there is little chance of reinfection . the detection of sars-cov-2 specific igm and igg antibodies is an effective means to determine whether a patient has immunity against sars-cov-2 . but these patients still have the potential to infect others . therefore , after the patient is discharged from the hospital , it is recommended to continue the isolation management and health condition monitoring for 14 days . here are some tips and considerations for self-isolation : wear a mask , live in a single room with good ventilation , reduce close contact with family members , separate meals , good hand hygiene , and avoid outdoor activities . it is also recommended to visit the hospital for reexamination on the 14th and 28th days after discharge . \n\n function of government \n\n in the early stages of the epidemic , the chinese government adopted the principles of `` four early '' and `` four centralization '' to address the epidemic so that the epidemic situation was effectively controlled . the so-called `` four early '' principle is early detection , early reporting , early isolation , and early treatment . early detection and isolation of sars-cov-2-infected people , moving the prevention and control barrier forward , accelerating the grid-based management of the community , improving detection capabilities , optimizing the diagnosis and treatment process , and shortening the diagnosis time can effectively block the spread of the epidemic and reduce the infection rate . the principle of `` four centralization '' is to centralize patients , centralize experts , centralize resources , and centralize treatment . patients with severe illness are centralized at the best hospital with the strongest comprehensive capacity for treatment . at the same time , to centralize resources and experts to treat critically ill patients , multidisciplinary and comprehensive individualized diagnosis and treatment are applied in accordance with `` one person , one strategy , '' and finally , the mortality rate is effectively reduced . \n\n in addition , more than 37 000 medical staff from other parts of china participated in the treatment of patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia in wuhan , hubei , which fully reflects the noble qualities and good professionalism of chinese medical staff . \n\n limitations \n\n it has not been long since the occurrence of sars-cov-2 pneumonia , there are relatively few reports in the literature , and some opinions need to be further verified by multicenter big data . in addition , infectious diseases have different characteristics at different stages . whether some of the findings and opinions have always been applicable needs further evaluation . \n\n conclusions \n\n the sars-cov-2 originated from the huanan seafood market in wuhan , with bats as the likely original hosts and pangolins as potential intermediate hosts . the current source of the disease is mainly patients infected with sars-cov-2 . patients in the incubation period may also become sources of infection . covid-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact , and the population is generally susceptible . the epidemic has experienced the local outbreak stage and community transmission stage caused by the wuhan 's huanan wholesale seafood market exposure and is now in the stage of large-scale transmission caused by the spread of the epidemic . the r0 at the beginning of the epidemic was 2.2 , with an average incubation period of 5.2 days . the proportion of critically ill patients was 23.4 % , the mortality was lower than those of sars and mers , and 96.5 % of the deaths occurred in hubei province , where the outbreak first occurred . among them , elderly men with underlying diseases had a higher mortality rate . in the process of fighting against the covid-19 , chinese medical staff have summarized a set of effective strategies and methods that are worthy of reference for their international counterparts . because of powerful government intervention and the efforts of chinese medical staff , the situation in china has now been controlled and has gradually improved . \n\n conflict of interests \n\n the authors declare that there are no conflict of interests . \n\n author contributions \n\n dr. ss and qs had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the

00001000	perioperative considerations during emergency general surgery in the era of covid-19 : a u.s . experience . \n\n the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 ( covid-19 ) strain has caused a pandemic that affects everyday clinical practice . care of patients with acute surgical problems is adjusted to minimize exposing health care providers to this highly contagious virus . our goal is to describe a specific and reproducible perioperative protocol aiming to keep health care providers safe and , simultaneously , not compromise standard of care for surgical patients . 
00001000	to do or not to do ? : a review of cancer surgery triage guidelines in covid-19 pandemic \n\n covid-19 pandemic has emerged as a global health emergency involving more than 200 countries so far . the number of affected population is on rising , so is the mortality . this crisis has overwhelmed the healthcare infrastructures in many affected countries . due to overall rising cancer incidence and specific concerns , a cohort of cancer patients forms a distinct subset of the population in whom a correct and timely treatment has a huge impact on the outcome . during this period , oncology care is definitely affected owing to many factors like lockdowns , reduced beds and deferral of elective cases to halt the spread of the pandemic . surgery remains the best line of defence in many solid organ tumours especially in early stage and is potentially curative . china , the source of this pandemic , has taken more than 3 months to enter the post transitional phase of this pandemic . deferring cancer surgeries for this long period may have a direct impact on the long-term outcomes of cancer patients . many surgical oncology associations across the globe have come up with triage guidelines for surgical care of cancer patients ; however , these are based on expert opinion rather than actual data . herein , we intend to review these guidelines with respect to the risk of disease progression in cancer patients . in the absence of actual data on cancer surgery care during this pandemic , clinical decisions should be based on careful consideration of disease-related and patient-related factors . while some of the cancer surgeries can be safely delayed for some time , how long we can delay surgeries safely can not be answered/ explained by any means . thorough evaluation and discussion by an expert and experienced multidisciplinary team appears to be the most effective way forward . \n\n introduction \n\n in the new decade , our world woke up to a new medical challenge : the sars covid-19 pandemic . as of march 31 , 2020 , this pandemic has affected 801,400 people and killed 38,743 people across the globe . the experience from china , the source of the outbreak , and other countries affected by the pandemic has shown the magnitude by which healthcare facilities can be overwhelmed during this crisis . worldwide measures to 'flatten the curve ' of this medical emergency have been implemented , so as to buy time for the national healthcare infrastructure and resources to gear up to deal with this catastrophic illness . hospitals also face a challenge to cater the needs of their existing sick patients , particularly those with malignancies . with this pressure on healthcare facilities combined with other realities of increasing cancer incidence , the need for special resources in oncology care , guarded prognosis in many malignancies and semi-emergent nature and need of cancer treatment , it is extremely difficult for an oncology healthcare personnel to decide who gets treatment for cancer and who has to wait . while the oncologist makes this judgement , they welter between maintaining a balance between logical and philosophical decision making during this crisis . as cancer surgeries involve significant healthcare resources in terms of infrastructure , intensive care unit beds , blood products and manpower , surgical oncologists face a dilemma regarding the triage of surgical patients during this period of uncertainty . guidelines , laid by professional organisations like the society of surgical oncology ( sso ) , american cancer society ( acs ) , european association of urology ( eau ) , indian association of surgical oncology ( iaso ) and federation of head neck oncology ( fhno ) are predominantly based on expert opinions and are vague at places . herein , we intend to review triage guidelines for cancer surgery , laid down by these associations around the globe . \n\n lessons from the past \n\n covid-19 is the sixth global public health emergency in the history as declared by who . the two epidemics in recent past , sars-cov ( 2002-2003 ) and the mers-cov ( 2012-2015 ) , have given us insight into how closely these three manifest , albeit sars covid-19 has emerged to be more lethal than the other two . these epidemics have taught us to initiate response interventions in the form of early detection , containment , control and mitigation . sadly , there is a dearth of literature from sars and mers epidemics on experience and implications in the field of cancer surgery . \n\n the 'novel ' virus \n\n the novel coronavirus ( sars-cov-2 ) has been documented to have an efficient human to human transmission process via airborne , droplet and contact routes . unlike the sars-cov , patients of sars-cov-2 can transmit the infection during the incubation period as well . the age group with the highest risk for acquiring primary and secondary cases of infection is 50-65 years ( most cancers are found in the same age group ) . about 50 % of patients have a subclinical infection , 30 % have mild to moderate symptoms and 20 % can develop severe symptoms with 5-10 % requiring icu care and ventilatory requirement . symptoms common to most coronavirus infections are fever , chills , generalized myalgia , drowsiness , cough , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea . the median duration of viral shedding is about 20 days and longest known to be 37 days , with continue shedding until death , unaltered by the administration of antiviral drugs such as ritonavir and lopinavir . the median time of requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation reported is 14.5 days , and the median time to death being 18.5 days . sepsis , followed by respiratory failure , adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) , heart failure , acute kidney injury , shock and secondary infections ( including ventilator-associated pneumonia ) are the common complications with severe infections . the virus can be isolated from oropharyngeal and respiratory secretions and also in stool samples of affected individuals . however , the virus has not been isolated in the blood or urine . the world health organization ( who ) and centre for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) recommend rt-pcr for laboratory diagnosis of sar-cov-2 . china , where the pandemic started , has now entered the post pandemic or the transitional phase , and clinical epidemiological data from china can prove to be a guiding light for the management of cases . so far social distancing , a modern form of quarantine , has proven to be the most effective preventive strategy for containment of this pandemic . two drugs , remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine , have shown in vitro efficacy against sars-cov-2 . further population studies with these drugs are awaited , and it will take another few months till we have a vaccine for sars-cov-2 . \n\n oncology patient cohort : a special set of population \n\n according to the globocan 2018 , globally , there were 18.1 million new cancer cases and 9.6 million cancer deaths in 2018 with a speculated increasing trend in overall incidence . cancer patients are at heightened risk for infection owing to suppressed immunity due to the malignancy per se and secondary to the effect of chemotherapy , radiotherapy and surgery . also , reports have shown an increased rate of complications , need for ventilatory support , admission to intensive care units , overall poor prognosis and death in cancer patients with covid-19 infection . a particular concern for a cancer surgeon is to weigh the risk of deferring cancer surgery versus the risk of covid-19 exposure and infection to patients as well as health care providers . disruptions in outbreak mitigation strategies like social distancing and prudent utilization of limited health resources also need consideration in this regard . \n\n cancer surgery in covid-19 outbreak \n\n author , year [ ref ] no of patients malignancy time to surgery salient features kristian et al . 2020 - urinary bladder - delay in cystectomy by

urothelial carcinoma , acc adrenocortical carcinoma \n\n * phase 1 recommendations where hospital resources are not exhausted , available icu beds and covid trajectory not in rapid escalation phase \n\n cancer surgeries utilise substantial resources in a hospital including diagnostic modalities , blood products , icu beds and even ventilators . hence , it is imperative to carefully decide the treatment plan for every patient by involving the multidisciplinary team , deciding which ones can safely be kept on the waiting list or started any bridging therapy until surgery . existing covid-19 cases , less volunteers for blood donation due to lockdown and rejection of donors due to history of exposure , symptoms and sars-cov-2 positivity can further dwindle the availability of the blood and blood products . although there exists a theoretical risk of transmission of the virus in blood products , currently there is no data suggesting transmission of sars cov-2 by transfusion . however , the american association of blood banks and european center for disease prevention and control ( ecdc ) have suggested deferral of blood donation by patients with a history of probable exposure and travel ( by 3 weeks ) and covid positive cases ( by 4 weeks ) . however , routine screening of donors is not yet recommended . published chinese reports on the outcomes of cancer patients infected with covid-19 indicated a 3.5 times higher risk of needing mechanical ventilation or icu admission or dying compared with patients without cancer . thus altogether , subjecting a cancer patient to surgery has its own risks to the patient and burdening the hospital resources . however , delaying the cancer surgeries have other implications like an increased extent of surgery in the event of cancer progression , increased perioperative morbidity/mortality and also missing a chance of offering cure due to disease spread caused by waiting . these facts can not be overseen , also , cancer is a bigger problem than covid-19 from patient 's perspective . table 1 summarises various studies addressing the impact of time to treatment initiation or delaying surgeries on cancer survival . keeping these concerns in mind , some guidelines have recommended a possible triage ( table 2 ) to offer surgeries , even during the course of an active pandemic , for certain precarious malignancies who are known to have rapid progression . \n\n anaesthesia-related concerns \n\n surgical intervention on asymptomatic infected patients in standard operating theatres without negative pressure capability can have devastating consequences exposing operating room personnel including surgeons , anaesthetists and nursing staff to a significant risk and due precautionary measures are needed . the american association of anaesthetists has provided excellent guidelines to follow during this pandemic . some of the important measures are attention to surface and equipment cleaning during and between cases , regular glove changing , regular handwashing , avoiding high flow devices especially if not using personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , video laryngoscopy assisted intubation where possible and ensuring appropriate disinfection procedures . airway manipulation puts the anaesthetist and all healthcare workers at exposure to aerosols from the patient . aerosol generating procedures during administration of general anaesthesia include bag and mask ventilation , endotracheal intubation and open airway suctioning . it is preferable to use regional anaesthesia wherever feasible , with added advantage of less effect on pulmonary function as compared to general anaesthesia . considering the significant risk of covid transmission related to anaesthesia , it is prudent to defer the non-emergent surgical interventions . however , cancer surgeries can not truly be considered as non-emergent interventions as there is a real risk of disease progression during the waiting period . \n\n individual organ system considerations \n\n gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary cancers \n\n the sars-cov-2 is shed in intestinal cells . also , the human colorectal adenocarcinoma-derived lovo cell line has been shown to be susceptible to sar-cov producing a sustainable infection which persists after multiple passages . intestinal biopsies from infected patients have demonstrated viral particles on electron microscopy without any lytic effects or inclusion bodies on light microscopy . the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are closely related and possible feco-oral transmission of the virus has also been suggested . hence , any elective gastrointestinal surgery/endoscopic procedures can pose a threat of transmission to surgeons and health care workers . cases that clearly require emergency intervention like obstruction , perforation and massive bleeding obviously can not be deferred . hu et al. , yu g et al. , luo et al . and chen et al . have reported their experience in managing colorectal and gastrointestinal malignancies during this pandemic and recommended stage-based treatment strategies . the american college of surgeons and society of surgical oncology have also suggested their take on the same issue ; however , these are based on expert opinion rather than any strong evidence . \n\n as cancer surgeons , one has to be aware about the prevention strategies for sars-cov-2 and implement this information into clinical practice to halt the spread of this pandemic . neoadjuvant therapy should be offered wherever possible in advanced gastrointestinal cancers . obstructing growths of gastroesophageal junction or colon without signs of peritonitis should be offered endoscopic stents wherever feasible . for bleeding tumours , transcatheter arterial embolization is an option if facilities are available . liver malignancies amenable to ablation , transarterial embolization and stereotactic surgery should be tackled accordingly . pre-admission screening of every patient to rule out asymptomatic infection and rt-pcr panel with chest ct scan for patients with fever ( > 37.3 c ) , travel history and positive contact history is recommended for gastrointestinal cancer patients due for surgery . extra precautionary measures should be taken for medical staff involved in the surgical procedures . local governing authorities should be informed if one has to perform any emergency surgery on sars-cov-2-infected patient . cytoreductive surgeries with or without hipec for peritoneal surface malignancies of low-grade malignancies can be deferred . post neoadjuvant therapy cases can continue with therapy . chinese studies have recommended a laparoscopic approach over open for colorectal surgeries ; however , the measure to contain the aerosol dissemination during pneumoperitoneum has to be dealt with care . \n\n thoracic cancers \n\n this cohort represents patients with a higher risk for deterioration of pulmonary function secondary to existing lung diseases , pneumonitis due to other infections , radiation pneumonitis , immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated pneumonia and tumour progression all which can mask an underlying sars-cov-2 infection . ct imaging is essential for the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection in the absence of microbiological tests and the ct picture might be confusing in these patients . hence , a careful history of exposure , along with strong index suspicion , is required to rule out covid-19 . smoking , one of the commonest risk factors in lung cancer , has not been independently shown to affect the mortality in sars-cov-2 patient ; however , pre-existing chronic obstructive lung disease is associated with increased mortality . perforated oesophageal malignancies , threatened airways , anastomotic leaks , bleeding , post-operative complications like hemothorax , and empyema need immediate intervention and need to be taken to theatre on priority basis . tian et al . reported post-operative mortality in one out of two patients with lung cancer , who were detected sars-cov-2-positive after surgery . xin et al. , yan et al . have reported specific recommendations for the management of lung cancer in the covid-19 epidemic , but these articles are published only in the chinese language and hence difficult to interpret for others . \n\n head neck cancers \n\n oropharyngeal malignancies pose a clear threat of aerosol exposure even with simple clinical examination . elective surgery of the upper airways requiring mandatory post-operative assisted mechanical ventilation , elective tracheostomies and extensive reconstructions should be preferably be deferred on case-to-case basis . direct and fibre optic laryngoscopy should be deferred . if it has to be done , then use adequate anaesthesia , avoid looking directly through the lens and attach a monitor . neck node fnac can be opted over endoscopic biopsy of hypopharyngeal/laryngeal malignancy wherever possible . emergency tracheostomy is a very high-risk procedure , hence adequate ppe , use of adequate anaesthesia to abolish cough reflex , and use of cuffed ( preferably double lumen ) tubes to avoid repeated suctioning are necessary . there is currently no literature on experience from covid-19 in head and neck malignancies , and there is a lack of clear recommendations on triage in these cases . \n\n urological cancers \n\n reports so far have failed to demonstrate shedding of sars-cov-2 in urine . prostate cancer and most renal malignancies have slow doubling times , and surgery can be safely deferred for few days . cystectomies for muscle-invasive bladder malignancies , nephrectomies for ct3+ tumours , retroperitoneal lymph node dissections for post chemotherapy testicular cancers , orchidectomy for testicular cancer and surgeries for clinically obstructing urethral malignancies should be performed with due precautions . \n\n breast , soft tissue and gynaecological cancers \n\n during the crisis , breast cancer surgery for early lesions and suspected benign pathology should be postponed , and those who have finished neoadjuvant therapy can wait for an additional 2-3 weeks on case-to-case basis . those with progressive disease on systemic therapy , angiosarcoma and malignant phyllode tumours should be offered surgery on a priority basis . most surgeries for endocrine tumours can be postponed , unless those with impending airway threat , pheochromocytoma and functional neuroendocrine tumours refractory to medical management . gynaecological malignancies can be aggressive if delayed , hence most guidelines recommended to go ahead with surgery wherever feasible . infections including joints and impending pathological fractures including peri-prosthetic fractures , soft tissue extremity sarcomas in the radiation or chemotherapy window and aggressive benign tumours like giant cell tumours should be offered surgical interventions as and when required . \n\n to summarise , in the absence of actual data on cancer surgery care during this pandemic , clinical decisions should be based on careful consideration of disease-related and patient-related factors . while some of the cancer surgeries can be safely delayed for some time , how long we can delay surgeries safely can not be answered/explained by any means . thorough evaluation and discussion by an expert and experienced multidisciplinary team appears to be the most effective way forward ; however , the pandemic is likely to have an adverse impact on a number of cancer patients due to the inevitable delay caused in their treatment . in the future , while such pandemics may still crop up and can not be prevented , the health care system and infrastructure should be boosted in anticipation , to combat illnesses such as cancer during these natural calamities . \n\n publisher 's note \n\n springer nature remains

00001000	prolonged grief disorder following the coronavirus ( covid-19 ) pandemic \n\n highlights \n\n prolonged grief disorder ( pgd ) cases will rise following the covid-19 pandemic \n\n the pandemic shows similarities to natural disasters which increase pgd prevalence . \n\n the circumstances of death during the pandemic likely increase pgd prevalence . \n\n evidence-based interventions for pgd should be made more accessible . \n\n internet-based interventions for pgd should be further developed and disseminated . \n\n dear editor , \n\n the consequences of the covid-19 pandemic are undeniably severe . as of the 18th of april 2020 , there are nearly 2.2 million confirmed cases and more than 146,000 deaths of registered infected individuals worldwide . additionally , the covid-19 outbreak may indirectly increase its death toll because treatments of people with other life-threatening diseases may be postponed and people experiencing other health issues may avoid visiting health care facilities to avoid getting infected . eventually , worldwide , the number of casualties can therefore be expected to exceed some of the most deadly natural disasters in recent history , including the 2004 east-asia tsunami ( 230,000 deaths ) and the 2010 haiti earthquake ( highest estimate : 316,000 deaths ) . the pandemic and governmental policies to curb its impact can yield additional stressors , e.g. , social isolation , job-loss , risk of viral infection for some workers , severe illness , quarantine , and intensive care admission . \n\n consequently , as demonstrated in recent pioneering studies in psychiatry research , increased psychiatric complaints , including anxiety and depression , are common among the general public in covid-19 affected areas ( e.g. , ) . while increases in mental health problems following natural disasters and viral outbreaks have been previously documented , there is historically less attention for severe , disabling and protracted grief responses , termed complicated grief or prolonged grief ( pg ) . this is at least partly due to the fact that , until recently , disturbed grief was not included as a disorder in psychiatric classification systems . in 2018 , this changed when prolonged grief disorder ( pgd ) was added to the international classification of diseases eleventh edition ( icd-11 ) . pgd is characterized by distressing and disabling yearning for the deceased and/or preoccupation with the deceased , accompanied by anger , guilt , and other symptoms indicative of intense emotional pain experienced for at least 6 months after the loss . in 2013 , the 5th diagnostical and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm-5 ) included persistent complex bereavement disorder in section 3 ; this will likely be replaced by a diagnosis also named prolonged grief disorder in section 2 of the forthcoming revision of the dsm-5 . despite a paucity of research on grief after global viral outbreaks , we argue that there are at least two reasons why the covid-19 pandemic may cause a worldwide rise of pgd cases . \n\n first , disasters with many casualties generally result in higher levels of pg symptoms among bereaved survivors , than observed following other modes of death . moreover , pg symptoms in these survivors are often distinct from comorbid disorders , such as post-traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) or depression ( for a brief review : ) . for instance , one year after the sichuan earthquake , latent class analyses demonstrated that approximately a quarter of bereaved survivors experienced high ptsd and pg symptom levels and another quarter exclusively experienced high pg symptoms . given the considerable similarities of disasters with the covid-19 pandemic ( i.e. , high death toll , many secondary stressors , severe societal disruption ) , we anticipate that similar patters in mental health symptoms will be observed among people bereaved by this pandemic . \n\n second , increased pgd rates can be expected considering the circumstances of many covid-19 deaths . pg symptoms are typically elevated when deaths are unexpected , traditional grief rituals ( e.g. , saying goodbye , viewing and burial of body ) are absent , and physical social support is lacking . moreover , due to government policy targeting the pandemic , the same potential risk factors could also increase grief severity of people whose family members died through other causes than covid-19 . \n\n to conclude , in the development and aftermath of the covid-19 pandemic , we anticipate that , worldwide , pgd will become a major public health concern . provided that future research corroborates these scientifically-founded predictions , it appears critical to anticipate a heightened need for effective pgd treatments . currently available care will likely not suffice , as evidence-based treatments for pgd are not widely available worldwide and there may be less availability of qualified health care professionals to deliver such treatments during the pandemic . therefore , we should collectively work toward improving accessibility of evidence-based pgd interventions , including cognitive-behavioral treatments in both face-to-face and online formats ( for a review : ) . it is particularly vital to stimulate the development and dissemination internet-based pgd treatments , as such interventions can be applied even if the pandemic persists for extended periods of time . \n\n funding source \n\n this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public , commercial , or not-for-profit sectors . \n\n credit author statement \n\n conceptualization : mce , liml ;

00000100	coronavirus-19 disease ( covid-19 ) : a case series of early suspected cases reported and the implications towards the response to the pandemic in zimbabwe . \n\n zimbabwe is among the countries that have been identified to be at risk of the covid-19 pandemic . as of the 15th of march 2020 , there was no confirmed case of the virus . official reports of suspected cases were used to appraise the general screening , case management , and the emergency preparedness and response of the country towards the covid-19 pandemic . in terms of the surveillance and capacity to screen at the ports of entry , the country seems to be faring well . the country might not be screening optimally , considering the number of covid-19 tests conducted to date and the suspected cases who missed testing . three of the suspected cases faced mental , social , and psychological consequences due to them being suspected cases of covid-19 . there is a need to enhance the screening process and infrastructure at all the ports of entry . more covid-19 diagnostic tests should be procured to increase the testing capacity . training and awareness on mental , social , and psychological consequences of covid-19 should be offered to the health care workers and the general public . more financial resources should be sourced to enable the country control the pandemic . 
00000010	the exponentially increasing rate of patients infected with covid-19 in iran . \n\n background : coronavirus , the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( covid-19 ) , is rapidly spreading around the world . since the number of corona positive patients is increasing sharply in iran , this study aimed to forecast the number of newly infected patients in the coming days in iran . methods : the data used in this study were obtained from daily reports of the iranian ministry of health and the datasets provided by the johns hopkins university including the number of new infected cases from february 19 , 2020 to march 21 , 2020 . the autoregressive integrated moving average ( arima ) model was applied to predict the number of patients during the next thirty days . results : the arima model forecasted an exponential increase in the number of newly detected patients . the result of this study also show that if the spreading pattern continues the same as before , the number of daily new cases would be 3574 by april 20 . conclusion : since this disease is highly contagious , health politicians need to make decisions to prevent its spread ; otherwise , even the most advanced and capable health care systems would face problems for treating all infected patients and a substantial number of deaths will become inevitable . 
01010000	the first disease x is caused by a highly transmissible acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus . \n\n based on the announcement of the world health organization ( who ) in 2018 , the wuhan pneumonia caused by an unknown etiology should be recognized as the first disease x . later , the pathogen was identified to be a novel coronavirus denoted 2019-ncov , which has 79.5 % and 96 % whole genome sequence identify to sars-cov and bat sars-related coronavirus ( sarsr-cov-ratg13 ) , respectively , suggesting its potential bat origin . with high human-to-human transmission rate ( r0 ) , 2019-ncov has quickly spread in china and other countries , resulting in 34,953 confirmed cases and 725 deaths as of 8 february 2020 , thus calling for urgent development of therapeutics and prophylactics . here we suggest renaming 2019-ncov as `` transmissible acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( tars-cov ) '' and briefly review the advancement of research and development of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines targeting the receptor-binding domain ( rbd ) and viral fusion inhibitors targeting the heptad repeat 1 ( hr1 ) domain in spike protein of 2019-ncov . 
00100000	identification of the hyper-variable genomic hotspot for the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 \n\n dear editor \n\n a recent study in this journal studied the genomes of the novel sars-like coronavirus ( sars-cov-2 ) in china and suggested that the sars-cov-2 had undergone genetic recombination with sars-related cov . by february 14 , 2020 , a total of 66,576 confirmed cases of covid-19 , people infected with sars-cov-2 , were reported in china , leading to 1524 deaths , per the chinese cdc ( http : //2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-ncov/ ) . several full genomic sequences of this virus have been released for the study of its evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics . here , we analyzed the potential mutations that may have evolved after the virus became epidemic among humans and also the mutations resulting in the human adaptation . \n\n ( a ) the similarity between sars-cov-2 and other beta coronaviruses using the sliding window showed that sars-cov-2 was similar to bat virus ratg13 . ( b ) the molecular phylogenetic tree based on protein sequences established the high similarity among sars-cov-2 and its near relatives . ( c ) the mutations that developed after it came to circulate among humans did not include any mutation with high occurrence . ( d ) the graphs show all of the differences between sars-cov-2 and its close relative strains isolated from bats . \n\n fig 1 \n\n the sequences of betacov were downloaded on february 3 , 2020 from the gisaid platform . a total of 58 accessions were available , among which betacov/bat/yunnan/ratg13/2013 is a known close relative of sars-cov-2 . four accessions , namely , betacov/italy/inm1/2020 , betacov/italy/inm2/2020 , betacov/kanagawa/1/2020 , and betacov/usa/il1/2020 , were excluded because of the short-truncated sequences or multiple ambiguous nucleotides . a total of 54 accessions ( supplementary table 1 ) isolated from humans were utilized in the following analysis . the sequences nc_004718.3 of sars coronavirus genes were utilized to define the protein products of sars-cov-2 . the protein sequences of orf1ab , s , e , m , and n genes were translated , and all of the loci without experimental evidences were excluded . first , the protein sequences of sars-cov-2 were compared with ratg13 , human sars ( nc_004718.3 ) , bat sars ( dq022305.2 ) , and human mers ( nc_019843.3 ) by calculating the similarity in a given sliding window ( fig . 1 a ) . the sliding window was set to 500 for orf1ab and s , and to 50 for proteins e , m , and n considering their short length . sars-cov-2 were highly similar to ratg13 isolated from bats , showing 96 % identity based on the whole-nucleotide sequences and 83 % based on the protein sequences , suggesting a bat zoonotic origin of sars-cov-2 . orf1a , and the head of s seemed to have diverged from other beta coronaviruses . \n\n the molecular phylogenetic tree ( fig . 1b ) was built by using the maximum likelihood method based on the jtt matrix-based model . it hinted that the protein sequences of sars-cov-2 had over 99 % similarity . twenty-eight viruses had shared the same protein sequences , and could be the original strain circulated in the humans . the other viruses had only a few mutations from it . this indicates that the virus could have evolved for only a very short time after gaining the efficient human to human transmissibility , as expected . next , we analyzed the mutations that occurred after infecting humans ( fig . 1c ) in order to identify mutations associated with more severe infection . here , two accessions ( betacov/shenzhen/szth-001/2020 and betacov/shenzhen/szth-004/2020 ) from shenzhen , which had 5 and 16 mutations , respectively , were excluded , considering the possible experimental issues . all of the mutations only occurred once , so it is possible that all of these mutations occur naturally and are associated with viral survival and infection . several mutations were clustered in peptides nsp3 and nsp4 of orf1ab and in the header of s. these results suggested that there had probably been no hyper-variable genomic hotspot in the sars-cov-2 population until now . \n\n we compared these results with those of the work of ceraolo and giorgi , who reported at least two hyper-variable genomic hotspots based on the shannon entropy of nucleotide sequences . they utilized all of the sequences , while we merged all of the fully identical sequences into one during our shannon entropy calculation . as shown in fig . 1b , 28 sequences were merged into one in present study because they had been collected in such a short time , so collection time and location could not have produced any large bias . if those identical sequences were calculated individually , any mutations on these 28 sequences would have sharply increased shannon entropy . the protein sequences were used to exclude any unimportant silent mutations . finally , the sequences of earliest sars-cov-2 were compared with ratg13 from bats ( fig . 1d ) . fisher 's exact test with post hoc test suggested that nsp1 , nsp3 , and nsp15 of orf1ab and gene s had significantly more mutations than other genes , which might facilitate human adaptation and infection . \n\n s gene encodes spike glycoprotein , which binds host ace2 receptors and is required for initiation of the infection . they reported that a 193-amino acid fragment was able to bind ace2 more efficiently than its unmutated counterpart . this region in which spike glycoprotein binds to ace2 had 21 mutations not found in ratg13 , suggesting their role in the adaptation to human hosts . peptide nsp1 facilitated viral gene expression and evasion from the host immune response . peptide nsp3 , named papain-like proteinase , was found to be associated with the cleavages , viral replication , and antagonization of innate immune . these two peptides are probably associated with the latent period after infection in humans . peptide nsp15 acted as uridylate-specific endoribonuclease . these results collectively suggest that peptides nsp1 , nsp3 , and nsp15 might have unclear but critical roles in this outbreak of sars-cov-2 . \n\n to summarize , this study confirmed the relationship of sars-cov-2 with other beta coronaviruses on the amino acid level . the hyper-variable genomic hotspot has been established in the sars-cov-2 population at the nucleotide but not the amino acid level , suggesting that there have been no beneficial mutations . the mutations in nsp1 , nsp3 , nsp15 , and gene s that identified in this study would be associated with the sars-cov-2 epidemic and was worthy of further study . \n\n declaration of competing interest \n\n none . \n\n references \n\n the continuous evolution and dissemination of 2019 novel human coronavirus \n\n genome composition and

10000000	epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 333 confirmed cases with coronavirus disease 2019 in shanghai , china . \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) is an emerging infectious disease first identified in wuhan city , hubei province , china . as of february 19th , 2020 , there had been 333 confirmed cases reported in shanghai , china . this study elaborates on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of covid-19 based on a descriptive study of the 333 patients infected with covid-19 in shanghai for the purpose of probing into this new disease and providing reference . among the 333 confirmed cases in shanghai , 172 ( 51.7 % ) were males and 161 ( 48.3 % ) were females , with a median age of 50 years . 299 ( 89.8 % ) cases presented mild symptoms . 139 ( 41.7 % ) and 111 ( 33.3 % ) cases were infected in wuhan and shanghai , respectively . 148 ( 44.4 % ) cases once had contact with confirmed cases before onset , while 103 ( 30.9 % ) cases had never contacted confirmed cases but they had a sojourn history in wuhan . the onset date of the first case in shanghai was december 28th , with the peak appearing on january 27th . the median incubation period of covid-19 was estimated to be 7.2 days . 207 ( 62.2 % ) cases had fever symptoms at the onset , whereas 273 ( 82.0 % ) cases experienced fever before hospitalization . 56 ( 18.6 % ) adults experienced a decrease in white blood cell and 84 ( 42.9 % ) had increased c-reactive protein after onset . elderly , male , and heart disease history were risk factors for severe or critical pneumonia . these findings suggest that most cases experienced fever symptoms and had mild pneumonia . strengthening the health management of elderly men , especially those with underlying diseases , may help reduce the incidence of severe and critical pneumonia . time intervals from onset to visit , hospitalization and diagnosis confirmed were all shortened after shanghai 's first-level public health emergency response . shanghai 's experience proves that covid-19 can be controlled well in megacities . 
10000000	evaluation of the auxiliary diagnostic value of antibody assays for the detection of novel coronavirus ( sars-cov-2 ) . \n\n the spread of sars-cov-2 has taken on pandemic proportions , affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks . the goal of this study was to assess the diagnostic values of different methods of detecting and estimating the sars-cov-2 infection , and the auxiliary diagnostic potential of antibody assays . by retrospectively analyzing the data of viral rnas and serum igm-igg antibodies against sars-cov-2 from 38 cases with confirmed covid-19 in the second people 's hospital of fuyang , we found that , in the early phase of the illness , the viral rna was most abundant in the sputum specimens , followed by that in the throat swabs , while the antibody assays identified fewer positive cases at this stage . however , the sensitivity of the antibody assays overtook that of rna test from eighth day of disease onset . simultaneous use of antibody assay and rt-qpcr improved the sensitivity of the diagnoses . moreover , we found that most of these cases with no detectable viral rna load during the early stages were able to be seropositive after 7 days . our findings indicate that the antibody detection could be used as an effective supplementary indicator of sars-cov-2 infection in suspected cases with no detectable viral rna , and in conjunction with nucleic acid detection in confirming the infection . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved . 
01000000	the anti-viral facet of anti-rheumatic drugs : lessons from covid-19 \n\n the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) infection has posed the world at a pandemic risk . coronavirus-19 disease ( covid-19 ) is an infectious disease caused by sars-cov-2 , which causes pneumonia , requires intensive care unit hospitalization in about 10 % of cases and can lead to a fatal outcome . several efforts are currently made to find a treatment for covid-19 patients . so far , several anti-viral and immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs have demonstrated some efficacy on covid-19 both in vitro and in animal models as well as in cases series . in covid-19 patients a pro-inflammatory status with high levels of interleukin ( il ) -1b , il-1 receptor ( r ) a and tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) -alpha has been demonstrated . moreover , high levels of il-6 and tnf-alpha have been observed in patients requiring intensive-care-unit hospitalization . this provided rationale for the use of anti-rheumatic drugs as potential treatments for this severe viral infection . other agents , such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine might have a direct anti-viral effect . the anti-viral aspect of immunosuppressants towards a variety of viruses has been known since long time and it is herein discussed in the view of searching for a potential treatment for sars-cov-2 infection . \n\n highlights \n\n covid-19 is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by interstitial pneumonia with acute respiratory distress and a cytokine storm in severe phases . \n\n some anti-rheumatic drugs including chloroquine , hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab have proved , in preliminary studies , a beneficial effect . \n\n baricitinib may target the ace2 receptor used by the virus to enter the cells and fedratinib may impair the th17-mediated responses . \n\n it is important to balance between the anti-viral effects and the immunosuppressive effects . \n\n introduction \n\n the outbreak of the 2019-coronavirus ( sars-cov-2 ) has posed the world at a pandemic risk . coronavirus-19 disease ( covid-19 ) is an infectious disease caused by sars-cov-2 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ) , an enveloped non-segmented positive-sense rna beta-coronavirus belonging to the same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) viruses , which causes pneumonia , requires intensive care unit hospitalization in about 10 % of cases and can lead to a fatal outcome . covid-19 is characterized in severe cases by an acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) and cytokine release syndrome and there is an immediate need for any agent before the development of a vaccine . to date , there is no registered molecule for the treatment of covid-19 patients . however , there are ongoing trials on the use of some anti-viral and immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs that have demonstrated efficacy on covid-19 both in vitro and in animal models as well as in small cases series . certainly , previous experiences on viruses belonging to the same beta-coronavirus family have formed the cornerstones of the current therapeutic strategy . the emergency facing the scientific community in addressing the pandemic from covid-19 provides the rationale for the use of drugs that have not yet been approved and with still preliminary scientific evidence . so far , therapeutic regimes include a combination of anti-viral drugs and supportive

clinical trials on rheumatologic drugs in covid-19 ( last updated on the 1st of april 2020 ) . \n\n table 1 \n\n id : nct , clinicaltrial.gov identifier , chictr , chinese clinical trial registry ; p/a , parallel assignment ; rct , randomized clinical trial ; n/a , not applicable ; ivig , intravenous immunoglobulins ; ifn , interferon . \n\n only trials in recruiting status were included about the use of hydroxychloroquine . \n\n controls . all consecutive patients with mild to moderate covid-19 infection , older than 18 , admitted during the previous 2 weeks , who were treated with antiviral and/or hydroxychloroquine . \n\n accumulating evidence suggests that sars-cov-2 infection is associated with a pro-inflammatory status characterized by high levels of different cytokines , including interleukin ( il ) -1beta , il-1ralpha , il-2 , il-10 , fibroblast growth factor ( fgf ) , granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor ( gm-csf ) , granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( g-csf ) , interferon-gamma-inducible protein ( ip10 ) , monocyte chemoattractant protein ( mcp1 ) , macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha ( mip1a ) , platelet derived growth factor ( pdgf ) , tumor necrosis factor ( tnfalpha ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) . critically ill patients requiring admission to intense care unit ( icu ) display markedly high concentration of il-2 , il-10 , g-csf , ip10 , mcp1 , mip1a , tnfalpha and il-6 . interestingly , levels of il-6 also correlated with increased mortality . moreover , in severe covid-19 , a reduction of natural killer cells , cd4+ and cd8+ t lymphocytes and ifngamma expression in cd4+ cells , has been observed . levels of il-6 , il-10 and tnfalpha inversely correlates with lymphocyte count , suggesting that the cytokine release syndrome may hamper the adaptative immune response against sars-cov-2 infection . moreover , high levels of ferritin were demonstrated in patients requiring icu hospitalization . this provided rational for the use of several anti-rheumatic drugs as potential treatments for this severe viral infection , while other preliminary experiments suggested a direct anti-viral effect of some of them at least in vitro . for instance , chloroquine ( cq ) and hydroxychloroquine ( hcq ) are currently used to face covid-19 . tocilizumab , an anti-il-6 monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) , has been used with encouraging results in particularly ill patients since a massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines , especially il-6 , by may occurs in lung epithelium in severe cases . trials to test the efficacy of tocilizumab on severe covid-19 patients are ongoing ( table 1 ) . \n\n nonetheless , in the last two decades , rheumatology has known an incredible revolution in terms of available treatment and outcome for patients with several molecules that can now be used in the armamentarium of the clinician . these molecules are targeted towards specific mechanisms in immune pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases , either blocking/modulating inflammatory pathways and specific cell subpopulations , apoptosis , autophagy and other mechanisms that could hamper selective viral responses . \n\n glucocorticoids \n\n glucocorticoids ( gcs ) are among the most frequently used agent in rheumatologic clinical practice . the gcs have proved to be effective in the management of a broad spectrum of diseases such as ra , systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) , vasculitis both representing the main treatment or a bridging/supporting therapy to the immunosuppressant . \n\n glucocorticoids are lipophilic molecules able to activate cytoplasm receptors and then , translocating into the cellular nucleus , to change the expression of several genes , including those responsible for inflammatory response . gcs promote anti-inflammatory proteins transcription such as il-10 and , simultaneously , impair the expression of pro-inflammatory proteins such as il-1 , il-2 , il-6 , tnf- alpha and ifn- gamma . gcs can also inhibit leukocytes migration to the inflammation site . \n\n therefore , it is not surprising that gcs are burdened with numerous and well-known side effects , including the increased infection risk . for instance , in ra patients the use of 7.5 mg or more of daily prednisone can increase the risk of infection requiring hospitalization up to six times than in the control group . on the other hand , an improved ra disease activity achievable with glucocorticoids is associated with lower serious infection rates . moreover , these drugs appear to be independent predictors of infection-related hospitalization . although most of the gc-related reported infections are bacterial , viral infections have been reported too , primarily represented by hsv and hbv reactivation . the most debating question is the possible usage of gcs during covid-19 pandemic and , in case , which , at which disease stage , and at which dosage/administration route . hydrocortisone showed to improve respiratory and mortality outcome in bacterial severe community-acquired pneumonia and inconstant efficacy in septic shock . budesinide might reduce post viral-inflammatory-cytokine production by human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro , while discordant results are reported in viral influenza pneumonia . \n\n based on the current evidences , as reported by the who regarding covid-19 , gcs should not be routinely given for treatment of viral pneumonia outside of clinical trials . \n\n various studies reported that gcs administration in patients with severe influenza pneumonia was associated with a higher rate of mortality . a meta-analysis conducted with a total of 6548 patients with influenza pneumonia ( h7n9 or h1n1 ) , found the use of systemic gcs ( methylprednisolone with different dose ranges , when reported ) associated with higher mortality rate ( risk ratio [ rr ] 1.75 , 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] 1.30-2.36 , z = 3.71 , p = 0.0002 ) , longer intensive care unit permanence and higher rate of secondary infection . \n\n the use of systemic gcs , especially methylprednisolone , in mers-cov-infected patients , was found as one of the most significant factors that contributed to increased mortality , with an odd ratio of 3.85 . nonetheless , no information about dose and duration of the treatment were reported in this retrospective study . as reported in a recent cochrane analysis , these data are predominantly based on observational studies and mostly of low quality . in fact , li et al . observed in a prospective trial , that the use of low to moderate dose of gcs on 2141 patient infected by h1n1 virus , 54.2 % complicated by ards , significantly reduced both 30 and 60-day mortality ( ahr 0.49 [ 95 % ci 0.32-0.77 ] ( ahr 0.51 [ 95 % ci 0.33-0.78 ] ) . analysing the outcome of mers-cov infected patients treated with gcs , arabi et al . did not find a rise in death rates correlated to the use of the drug but found delayed lower respiratory tract clearance of mers-cov rna . equally , the use of gcs seemed to protract sars-cov viral clearance . \n\n nonetheless , in reference to ards , at the moment there is very low evidence on the positive effect of the treatment in this critical condition . there is not conclusive evidence that supports the use of gcs in the treatment of viral respiratory infection and their use remains controversial in covid-19 . an expert consensus form the chinese thoracic society developed few basic principles for the use of gcs in covid-19 patients . there is evidence that in patients with confirmed ards , not infected with covid-19 , a benefit from dexamethasone is provided when used at a low dosage and for a limited period ( 10 days ) in reducing the consequences of mortality thus supporting the assistance of such therapy on elective indication . \n\n as mentioned above , gcs inhibit immune reactions acting on migration and chemokines production . ; thus , this might lead to prolonged viremia and can impair viral clearance . in addition , it is important not to forget the other corticosteroid-related adverse effects , especially on the cardio-vascular system , which can be another precipitating factor in these critically ill patients that are often already comorbid . \n\n nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n\n the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) are available over the counter for several indications and are prescribed widely for symptomatic relief for pain , fever , and inflammation . \n\n the inhibitory effect of nsaids on prostaglandin synthases , also known as cyclo-oxygenases ( cox ) 1 and 2 , reduces the production of prostaglandins ( pgs ) . many nsaids blocks both coxs , such as ibuprofen , while nsaids selective for cox-2 , including celecoxib and diclofenac , selectively target cox2 thought to be of most relevance to prostanoid formation in inflammation . acetaminophen belongs to nsaids but its effects on cox activity remain controversial being a weak , reversible , isoform-nonspecific cox inhibitor . the cox-2 is an important mediator of inflammation in response to viral infection , and it contributes to viral replication , for cmv , hcv , and viruses belonging to the flaviviridae family . recently , it has been documented that compounds that significantly inhibit cox-2 enzymatic activities and prostaglandin e2 levels , associated with viral replication , showed therapeutic safety and efficacy in vitro and in vivo for flaviviridae infection . \n\n evidence on the severe pneumonia related to the avian influenza a h7n9 virus documented that treatment with a combination of antiviral and cox2-selective nsaid was able to ameliorate pulmonary inflammation in mice . interestingly , the tumorigenic potential of cox-2 and pge2 through eicosanoid receptors is described in several viral associated malignancies such as the kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpes virus and support cox-2 as a therapeutic target with an antineoplastic purpose . several years ago , authors have shown that the spike protein of sars-cov activated the cox-2 expression via erk/nf-kb and pi3k/jnk pathways . these studies provided key findings on molecular mechanisms involved in the viral infection and the induction of inflammation by sars-cov . few data on the inhibitory effects of ibuprofen on ace2 were reported in animal models . \n\n naproxen is an inhibitor of both cox-2 and of influenza a virus nucleoprotein ( np ) . this drug may have the potential to present antiviral properties against sars-cov-2 . a recent clinical trial showed that the combination of clarithromycin , naproxen and oseltamivir reduced mortality of patients hospitalized for h3n2 influenza infection . a phase 3 clinical trial is ongoing to explore the efficacy of addition of naproxen in the standard treatment of critical patients hospitalized for covid-19 . however , since the use of both nsaids and acetaminophen could be associated with a masking of the symptoms during covid-19 , and thus to a diagnostic delay and a prolonged illness , complications may be more common when nsaids are used : both respiratory and cardiovascular . in patients with acute respiratory infection , nsaids have been widely used and evidence suggests that in these circumstances nsaids are associated with an increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction . moreover , large randomized trials support that nsaids may cause more prolonged illness or complications when taken during respiratory tract infections . patients with covid-19 have a higher risk of hospitalization , critical disease and mortality correlated with age and presence of comorbidities , particularly hypertension . thus , besides further research evidence relating specifically to people with covid-19 are awaited , regular symptomatic nsaids use should not be recommended as the first line option for managing covid-19 . \n\n chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine \n\n chloroquine ( cq ) and its derivative hydroxychloroquine ( hcq ) are aminoquinolinic compounds currently registered for the treatment and prevention of malaria and for the treatment of a number of autoimmune diseases . cq was developed in the 1930s and extensively used during world war ii to prevent and treat malaria infection , but its use as an antimalarial is now very limited due to the widespread resistance of plasmodium . \n\n hcq is currently part of first-line treatment for ra and sle , due to its immunomodulatory effect . the mechanisms of action are still not fully elucidated , nonetheless some important aspects are well known . cq is a weak base with a large distribution volume and accumulates at high concentrations in almost all body tissues , including the lungs . after oral administration , it is efficiently absorbed and is present in the blood mainly as a protonated molecule . however , the circulating unprotonated portion can easily cross cell membranes and , due to its basic charge , tends to accumulate in acidic organelles such as lysosomes , golgi vesicles and endosomes , where it binds to free protons , thus significantly increasing the ph . thus , a large number of enzymes contained in these organelles , which optimally work in the acidic milieu , are inhibited . this mechanism is presumably at the basis of the direct anti-parasitic , anti-viral , and immunomodulatory effects of the molecule . although most of the evidence in this field regards cq , there are some data showing similar effects by hcq . additionally , current data support that the mechanism of action of the two molecules is equivalent and hcq appears to be significantly less toxic and has almost completely replaced the use of cq in the treatment of rheumatic diseases . \n\n most of the data on the anti-viral activity of cq derive from experiments performed on human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) , hepatitis a , and influenza viruses . some viruses , in fact , enter host cells via endocytosis and , following fusion of endosomes with lysosomes , cause the disruption of the host cells to release the nucleic acid and the enzymes required for replication . similarly , some enveloped viruses require post-translational modifications of envelope glycoproteins by endosomal enzymes in order to complete the maturation process and shed from the host cell . additionally , enzymatic activity is required in multiple intra-cytoplasmic signal cascade and post-translational modifications that lead to cytokine , such as tnfalpha and il-6 , and chemokine release . \n\n sars-cov-2 replicates in the cytoplasm of an infected host cell . sars-cov-2 binds to the host-cell with several receptors , among which is angiotensin converting enzyme ( ace ) -2 and picalm through interaction of the spike ( s ) glycoprotein . virus entry into the host cell can occur through fusion with the surface of the host cell , with the subsequent release of the genomic rna into the cytoplasm . alternatively , sars-cov-2 can enter the host cell through the formation of endocytic vesicles , and genomic rna is released into the cytoplasm following fusion with the vesicle membrane ( not shown ) . chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can alter the glycosylation process of ace-2 , which may have an effect on the affinity of sars-cov-2 . moreover , chloroquine can interfere with the bond between picalm and clathrin impeding the endocytosis of the virus . finally , chloroquine may alter the ph of the lysosome blocking replication of the virus . \n\n fig . 1 \n\n after the outbreak of sars in the early 2000s , studies have been performed to identify potential effective anti-viral treatments on sars-cov-2 , including cq . in fact , coronaviridae seem to require the above-mentioned steps to replicate . in vitro experiments showed that the cq-treatment of infected vero e6 cells - a cell lineage commonly used to assess viral replication in vitro -caused a significant inhibition of viral replication when the drug was added within the first 5 h post-infection , with more marked effects when administered before or within the first hour . interestingly , the half maximal inhibitory concentration ( ic50 ) doses range between 1 and 10 mum , that are easily and safely reachable in humans . in addition to the mechanisms described above , cq seems to inhibit the glycosylation process of angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ace ) -2 , which may have an effect on the affinity of sars-cov for its receptor , further contributing to the inhibition of virus cell entry . another possible effect through interfering with the bond between picalm ( phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein ) and clathrin impeding the endocytosis of the virus . other in vitro data demonstrated that cq , probably through its ph-dependent enzyme inhibitory effect , can significantly hamper phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( mapk ) , thus , blocking replication of the human coronavirus hcov-229e , similarly to a selective inhibitor of the same enzyme ( fig . 1 ) . \n\n in february 2020 , wang et al . reported the first evidence of the in vitro efficacy of cq on sars-cov-2 with an effective concentration ( ec ) 90 value of 6.90 mum , which can be achievable with clinically used doses . these data have been subsequently confirmed by other authors who compared the in vitro anti-viral activity of cq and hcq . hcq was demonstrated to be more potent than cq with lower ec50 values , which were even lower for longer incubation time . this effect may be due to the slow and progressive accumulation of hcq at higher concentrations into the cells . \n\n nevertheless , in vitro data are obtained in ideal experimental conditions and do not necessarily imply effects in vivo . although very few in vivo data are currently available on sars-cov or sars-cov-2 , some studies have been performed on animal models of coronavirus-related diseases , reporting conflicting results . an interesting study tested the anti-viral activity of cq against hcov-oc43 infection in new-born mice . female pregnant c57bl/6 mothers were administered different solutions of cq and five-day-old pups were infected with hcov-oc43 after birth . the highest survival rate was depicted in the group of pups breastfed by cq-treated mothers with survival rates declining in a dose-dependent manner . on the contrary , the mortality rate in the untreated cohort and the cohort of pups that received cq transplacentally was 100 % . moreover , other studies have demonstrated the immunomodulatory effect of cq on tnfalpha , il-1beta and il-6 in coronavirus-related feline infectious peritonitis , while others have failed to show any significant effect . it is possible that these effects may contribute to the clinical efficacy in covid-19 , also given the rationale behind the use of il-6 inhibitors . \n\n taking into account the potential beneficial effect of cq and hcq in vitro studies , clinical trials have been recently conducted to confirm these data in subjects affected by covid-19 infection ( table 1 ) . preliminary results seem to confirm that cq can improve covid-19 associated pneumonia in terms of inhibition of pneumonia exacerbation , amelioration of lung imaging and shortening of disease course . \n\n based on this evidence , cq and hcq have been included in most treatment protocols in china and worldwide . however , the risk of adverse events has been heavily underlined . \n\n a recent systematic review included six articles and 23 ongoing clinical trials in china . cq seems to be effective in limiting the replication of sars-cov-2 . gautret et al . reported twenty cases were treated for 6 days with hcq at the dosage of 600 mg/day plus azithromycin that showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage compared to controls . the authors suggested that azithromycin added to hcq was significantly more efficient for virus elimination . \n\n in rheumatology practice , cq and hcq are among the most prescribed medications in patients with ra and connective tissue diseases and are very well tolerated . the potential adverse events , including retinopathy , cardiotoxicity and myelotoxicity , are rare and cumulative dose dependent . the risk of retinal toxicity in patients treated for 10 years with hcq for sle was shown to be around 7.5 % and higher in patients treated for longer periods . in the covid-19 associated acute infection , cq and hcq are used for a very short time ( 5-20 days according to expert consensus ) , with a probably negligible risk of adverse events . nevertheless , acute adverse events , such as hypersensitivity and gastrointestinal intolerance , require attention , especially in critically ill patients that may develop similar clinical manifestations due to covid-19 . additionally , cq and hcq can be safely used during pregnancy . nonetheless , the ideal dose regimen has not been established yet and most guidelines suggest the same protocols used in rheumatology , i.e . 500 mg bid of cq or 200 mg bid of hcq , including those from china and italy . although clinical trials in vivo are needed to found the best dosing regimen , a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model suggested a loading dose of hcq 400 mg bid on the first day , followed by 200 mg bid in the next four days , which should allow to maintain an appropriate plasma concentration up to ten days . \n\n to date , anti-malarials are one of the medications with the largest - albeit limited - scientific background warranting their use in covid-19 treatment protocols . soon , a significant amount of data should be available from clinical trials , in order to verify whether the theoretical strong effect of the drug has a real impact on survival and recovery of covid-19 patients . until then , due to the excellent safety profile and vast experience , their use remains a pillar of current treatment protocols . \n\n immunosuppressants \n\n the other concern for the rheumatologist is that immunocompromised patients may be at higher risk of developing covid-19 , while turning the speech around immunosuppressant drugs may represent unpredictable weapons in this scenario . indeed , coronaviruses have not shown to cause a more severe disease in immunosuppressed patients . for this family of viruses , the host innate immune response appears the main driver of lung tissue damage during infection . a review of the mortality and morbidity reports published on sars-cov and mers-cov , no fatality was reported in patients undergoing transplantation , chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive treatments , at any age . thus , in this second part of the review , we seek for any immunomodulatory agent that at any potential at least in in vitro studies of anti-viral activity , thus excluding others such as azathioprine . \n\n leflunomide \n\n leflunomide [ n- ( 4-trifluoromethylphenyl ) -methylisoxazol-4-carboxamide ; hwa 486 ] ( lef ) is a member of the malononitrile amide family of compounds and a marketed therapeutic agent for the treatment of ra , autoimmune disorders , and renal transplantation . its active form , teriflunomide , approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis , named also a77 1726 [ n- ( 4-trifluoromethylphenyl ) - 2-cyano-3-hydroxycrotoamide ] exhibits two main mechanisms of action : inhibition of protein tyrosine kinase activity and inhibition of t-cell proliferation . indeed , it interferes with the de novo pathway of pyrimidine synthesis through inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase , a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotide triphosphates ( pyntp ) . however , additional mechanisms of activity may remain to be discovered yet . \n\n numerous studies have already demonstrated several anti-viral effects of lef . the most important is against cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) infection in solid organ transplant recipients . the american society of transplantation and the transplantation society international cmv consensus group reported lef as a possible alternative or experimental therapy in case of extensive resistance to standard anti-viral treatment . even though randomized controlled trial are lacking , numerous case reports described the efficacy of lef in treating drug-resistant cmv systemic and ocular infections , or in preventing the recurrence of viremia in transplant patients . in one case report and in a retrospective study , lef ( 100 mg for 5 days followed by a maintenance dose of 20 mg every 12 h ) resulted to be effective in clearing low-dose viremia and long-term cmv suppression in lung transplantation . it must be noted that this small cohort was already taking other anti-viral agents . three case reports described that lef could be able to induce a persistent clearance of cmv ul97 and ul54 ( genes of resistance against classical anti-viral therapy ) in serum and clinical resolution in transplant patients complicated by active cmv retinitis resistant to treatment with systemic and intra-vitreal foscarnet , ganciclovir and oral valganciclovir . other case reports in hemopoietic stem cell transplant recipients described the use of lef , alone or in combination with other anti-viral drugs as a salvage therapy for recalcitrant cmv infection , with variable results . in addition , lef was reported in the treatment of acyclovir-resistant perianal herpes simplex type 2 ( hsv-2 ) infection in hiv patients . \n\n the anti-viral mechanism against cmv is an `` off target '' mechanism and also applies against beta-hsv-1 . in fact , even restoring pyrimidine nucleotide triphosphates to normal levels , viral replication is persistently impaired . lef reduces the in vitro spreading of cmv and hsv-1 infection by interfering with virion cytoplasmatic assembly in a dose-dependent manner . this action appears independent of the levels of pyntp and persists also in cmv strain d16 usually resistant to the action of ganciclovir , cidofovir and foscarnet . in particular , the drug induces failure to acquire tegument and external membrane in the cytoplasm of infected cells . it has been proposed that lef may interfere with tegument assembly by inhibiting protein phosphorylation of the phosphoproteins . thus , its anti-viral activity , specifically against cmv and hsv-1 , occurs at a late stage of viral assembly , in contrast with traditional anti-cmv agents that inhibit viral dna replication . viral protein synthesis does not seem to be affected , while two different studies reported discordant results on the viral dna production data from in vivo experiments document that lef is able in reducing viral load in nude rats . lef can significantly reduce cmv-induced apoptosis of the infected cells , interfering with the spreading of the virus . bilger et al . showed that teriflunomide can have a role against epstein-barr virus ( ebv ) . drug concentrations lower than those normally used for treatment of ra can prevent ebv-transformed human b cell proliferation thanks to an `` on target '' mechanism on b cells and an `` off target '' action that alter ebv latency protein expression . in fact , an increased expression of ebv nuclear antigen-2 ( ebna2 ) and latent membrane protein-1 ( lmp1 ) , the latter able to inhibit b cell proliferation , were observed . furthermore , teriflunomide induces expression of p53 and cleavage level of parp , promoting apoptosis of lymphocytes in vitro . no reduction of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cell ( nf-kb ) signaling by teriflunomide was reported in this setting . the drug can inhibit lytic ebv infection in vitro by preventing the initial steps of lytic viral reactivation by reducing immediate-early lytic protein and early lytic protein expression , in response to b-cell receptor , and by blocking lytic viral dna replication . \n\n intriguingly , lef has shown to influence hiv-1 replication in vitro . the drug downgrades viral proliferation inhibiting nf-kb activation . nevertheless , lef inhibits , through mek , map kinase pathway and protein tyrosine kinase , thus resulting in the reduction of cd28 and icos activity ; this leads to an increased viral load . \n\n reducing pyrimidine pool , teriflunomide can inhibit the replication of junin virus , the agent of argentine hemorrhagic fever and an enveloped negative-sense ssrna arenavirus , in a dose-dependent manner . the combination with ribavirin appeared to have a stronger anti-viral activity than monotherapy . \n\n the same mechanism of action seems to explain the anti-viral activity of teriflunomide on the foot-and-mouth disease virus , an rna virus member of the picornaviridae family , usually affecting livestock breeding . \n\n martin et al . reported preliminary effect on several rna viruses such us newcastle disease virus , rabies virus and influenza a virus . bk polyomavirus is a dna virus member of polyomaviridae family and causative agent of infectious hemorrhagic cystitis in transplant recipients and of polyomavirus-associated nephropathy ( pvan ) , a potentially dreadful complication after kidney transplantation . for several years , lef has been used as second-line therapy in refractory infection after reducing maintenance immunosuppression . small case series and a prospective open-label trial analyzed the effect of lef , used alone or in combination with other drugs ( tacrolimus/everolimus , fluoroquinolones ) , in pvan ; they described a partial success in viremia clearance or better renal outcome . nonetheless , as reported by the american society of transplantation infectious disease , true efficacy of these approaches has not been proved so far because of the lack of randomized controlled- trials . additionally , a meta-analysis , albeit with various limitations , failed to document significant benefits of these adjunctive therapies . \n\n no direct anti-viral effect on the dengue virus was reported by lef , despite the drug seem able to reduce dendritic cell migration and virus-induced cytokine releasing induced in vitro . \n\n enterovirus 71 ( ev-a71 ) is a neurotropic virus that can cause severe complications such as encephalitis . as it happens in viral infections , such as dengue fever and most recently covid-19 , a prominent role in the progression of tissue damage and of the severity of the disease appears to be secondary to the resulting cytokine release syndrome . similarly , in ev-a71 infection , il-6 seems to be closely correlated with the clinical severity of the disease . hung et al . observed that teriflunomide can significantly reduce ev-a71 yield in infected cells in vitro and is able to induce a 40-50 % reduction of il-6 levels , compared to controls . \n\n interestingly , lef showed robust efficacy in vitro and in vivo even against respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) , an rna virus . significant dose-dependent reduction of rsv induced syncytia formation in human hep-2 has been reported , and when the drug was used on infected cotton rats ( 30 mg/kg/day ) , it reduced by > 3 log the pulmonary viral load compared to controls , similarly to what chong et al . reported for cmv infected rats . \n\n the anti-viral effect of high concentrations of the drug was comparable to that of ribavirin , though lef showed greater anti-viral efficacy than ribavirin at lower concentration . \n\n dose-limiting side-effects of lef therapy are liver damage , lung disease , immunosuppression , diarrhea , rash , and reversible alopecia . in vivo , high dose of lef appears to be a potent inhibitor of t cells but also a partial inhibitor of b cell responses and can totally suppress humoral immune response against various antigens . the mechanisms by which lef can hamper the immune response to viral infections in humans are not known . although anti-viral effects of lef against various agents gave been demonstrated in humans , very few data are available on the optimal dosage , treatment duration and target blood levels of teriflunomide for an effective anti-viral activity , and its usage in covid-19 treatment are doubtful . \n\n mycophenolate mofetil \n\n mycophenolate mofetil ( mmf ) is an immunosuppressive agent commonly used for allograft rejections in different organs transplants and in the treatment of autoimmune diseases . \n\n mmf and its active form mycophenolic acid ( ma ) inhibit inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase ( impdh ) and block the conversion of inosine monophosphate ( imp ) to guanosine monophosphate ( gmp ) , hampering lymphocyte proliferation . this action is shared by ribavirin and it is almost the only anti-viral mechanism that has been demonstrated for mmf . \n\n different studies have shown anti-viral properties of mmf against various members of orthomyxoviridae family , especially against influenza viruses . these are single stranded ribonucleic acid negative-sense ( - ) ssrna viruses . mmf and ma have anti-viral activity against influenza viruses a ( iav ) ; ma also against influenza viruses b ( ibv ) . ma can prevent virus-induced cell death by ibv b/411 and by the pandemic iav ( h1n1 ) pdm09 virus h1/415 . it interferes with the early stage of the viral replication , before the protein synthesis . other experiments demonstrated ma anti-viral activity against eight different clinical isolates of a ( h1n1 ) , a ( h3n2 ) , a ( h7n9 ) and influenza b viruses ( ic50 < 1 mum ) . \n\n cho et al . demonstrated that mmf , blocking impdh , could completely inhibit a/vietnam/1194/2004 ( h5n1 ) virus mrna replication and protein expression in madin-darby canine kidney ( mdck ) cells and in infected mice . all infected lab rat treated survived , and the drug leaded to substantially reduced lung viral titers . additionally , mmf treatment reduced the il-1beta , interferon ( ifn ) -beta , il-6 , and ip-10 mrna expression levels in mdck infected cells . \n\n inconclusive results have been obtained against several other strains of influenza virus and there are discordant evidences regarding the action of the drug against zika virus ( zkv ) . zkv is not the only flavivirus against to mmf was tested . in one study the drug could significantly reduce cytopathic effect in west nile-virus-infected vero cells and , in another one , mmf demonstrated also a significantly anti-viral activity against japanese encephalitis virus in vitro and in vivo , protecting the infected mice with an ic50 of 3.1 mug/ml and a therapeutic index of 16 . other flavivirus susceptible to mmf are dengue virus type 2 , yellow fever virus 17d , modoc virus , and montana myotis leukoencephalitis virus . some studies report anti-viral effect of the drug against other several different rna viruses including chikungunya , smallpox virus , foot-and-mouth disease virus ( fmdv , peste des petits ruminants virus ( pprv ) , junin virus , norovirus , the arenavirus causative agent lassa 's hemorrhagic fever , the reovirus and others . \n\n the use of ma it has been also reported that the use of ma on rotavirus-infected-caco2 cells , could induce a 99 % inhibition of viral rna production at the clinically relevant concentration ( 10 mg/ml ) , with a persisting effect in time . \n\n the anti-viral effect against all these numerous viruses mentioned above appears to be due to the reduction of gmp cell pool , whereas and it can be reversible with the addiction of guanosine in a dose dependent manner . similarly , mmf inhibits viral rna , mrna protein synthesis , and it almost completely blocks virus entry and cytopathic effect of human parainfluenza virus type 2 ( hpiv-2 ) , but these restrictions are recovered by guanosine and s- ( 4-nitrobenzyl ) -6- thioinosine administration . the only evidence of the presence of another antiviral mechanism of mmf derives from a study on hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) . it seems that the drug is able to inhibit in vitro and in vivo the virus replication by augmentation of ifn-stimulated gene expression , suppressing huh-7 cell autophagy , decreasing autophagosome formation , and increasing p62 level expression in vitro . mers-cov caused several fatal infections in the middle east and traveler-associated cases in europe and africa with over 35 % fatality since its emergence in 2012 . a clinical retrospective analysis on 51 patients infected by mers-cov showed that treatment with mmf was one of the predictors of increased survival . ma together with disulfiram and/or 6-thioguanine seemed able to synergistically inhibit mers-cov papain-like protease plpr . chan et al . found that a concentration < =0.063 mug/ml of mmf inhibited cytopathic effects , reduced the viral load and achieved a 100 % plaque reduction in vero cells infected . the combination of ma and ifn-1beta showed synergistic activity . despite these evidences , the same author observed that mmf and ma were ineffective in coronaviridae-infected-animal models . in fact , in one study all mers-cov-infected marmosets treated with mmf developed severe and/or fatal disease with higher mean viral loads than the untreated animals , and higher mortality than the ones treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and ifn-1beta . barnard et al . found the drug unable in preventing viral replication in the lungs of sars-infected balb/c mice , although it did not significantly increase it , as ribavirin did ; the same inefficacy against sars-cov replication has been previously reported . \n\n interestingly , mmf could act as a synergistic drug to potentiate the anti-viral effects of other drugs , through the depletion of the endogenous gtp pools . ma increases the anti-hbv activity of penciclovir , lobucavir , 37-fluorodideoxyguanosine , diaminopurine dioxolane . similar results have been obtained with the combination of mmf with other classical anti-viral drugs , such as abacavir , didanosine and tenofovir , treating hsv-1 , hsv-2 , cmv and others . all these evidences could allow the clinician to use of mmf as a support-drug of other anti-viral drug , in specifically clinical contest , even thou the lack of in vivo clinical trial . this is a strong limitation , considering that frequently in vitro activity does not correspond to a satisfactory action in vivo . nevertheless , mmf is a strong immunosuppressive agent , it reduces the immunity response to vaccination in transplant patients , and it is associated with increased risk of viral infections from human herpesvirus 6 , herpes zoster ( hz ) and cmv , although data remain inconclusive . \n\n methotrexate \n\n methotrexate ( 4-amino-10-methylfolic acid , mtx ) , an analogue and antagonist of folic acid , is the first-line disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( dmards ) in the treatment several rheumatic autoimmune diseases including ra , adult-onset still 's disease ( aosd ) , and psoriatic arthritis ( psa ) . its effectiveness is related to its ability to inhibit key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines by interfering with dihydrofolate reductase ( dhfr ) pathway . mtx thus limits the viability of highly replicating cells . moreover , mtx-induced reactive oxygen species generation modulates different cell functions , such as suppression of cytokine production and cell proliferation decreasing tnf-alpha , il-1beta , and adhesion molecules ( e-selectin and vcam-1 ) . \n\n interestingly , dhfr inhibitors have also been investigated to treat infectious diseases . \n\n current evidence supports mtx as a potential treatment of viruses mediated arthritis , specifically parvovirus b19 , hbv , hcv , and hiv . studies documented that pro-inflammatory mediators were markedly decreased after mtx treatment in virus-induced arthritis . as a remark , recent studies suggest that hepatitis b reactivation or on accelerated liver disease are rather infrequent manifestations during long-term mtx treatment . \n\n in vitro findings reported an anti-viral effect for mtx against zkv through inhibition of dhfr pathway with mechanisms similar to other published results in related flaviviruses . \n\n it is notable that authors documented the efficacy of intravitreal mtx as treatment option for patients with necrotizing retinitis ebv-positive not responding to conventional anti-viral therapy . mtx has a high risk of reactivation demonstrated for several viruses , including the abovementioned hbv and ebv , thus its usage as an anti-viral drug and as therapeutic weapon against covid-19 may not be suitable . \n\n colchicine \n\n one of the oldest know drugs so far in the field of rheumatology is colchicine . this is an inexpensive , orally administered , potent anti-inflammatory medication that was initially extracted from the autumn crocus and has been used for centuries . its mechanisms of actions are through the inhibition of tubulin polymerization and microtubule generation and , possibly , effects on cellular adhesion molecules , inflammatory chemokines , and the inflammasome . colchicine is currently indicated for the treatment of gout , familial mediterranean fever , and pericarditis . indeed , this agent is the main treatment of several rheumatic conditions in which the activation of the inflammasome and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines are the key pathogenic events . it alters the organization of actin cytoskeleton by binding to tubulin monomers and inhibits polymer formation . colchicine drug has shown anti-inflammatory effects , more pronounced on the il-1 and il-6 axis . it is highly concentrated in neutrophils and macrophages prolonging its action . its ability to bind tubulin achieves multiple cellular actions , including inhibition of the assembly of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ( nlrp3 ) inflammasome . in addition to its effect on neutrophils , colchicine impairs the release of il-1beta into neutrophil extracellular traps . many of the actions have been demonstrated in patients with coronary disease . colchicine blocks the nlrp3 inflammasome , a cytosolic complex responsible for the production of il-1beta and il-18 . in patients with acute coronary syndromes , in which il-1beta , il-18 , and downstream il-6 that are key inflammatory cytokines , colchicine administration was able to significantly reduce transcoronary gradients of all 3 cytokines in by 40 % -88 % . a similar reduction in il-6 but also in il-8 or tnf-alpha levels can be observed in mucocutaneous behcet 's disease patients . moreover , colchicine has anti-viral properties against flaviviridae and against the recombinant demyelinating strain of mouse hepatitis virus rsa59 as demonstrated reducing virus replication since microtubules are crucial in cell entry and blocking neuronal transport . it inhibits rsv replication reducing il-6 and tnf-alpha levels . some studies have suggested that colchicine and colchicine derivatives may have some influence hiv viral load . certain subsets of the 2003-sars coronavirus replication machinery have been shown to move in the cell in a manner that corresponds with microtubule-associated transport , inducing the formation of double-membrane vesicles in infected cells . sars-cov-2 is a similar virus to sars-cov and microtubule disruption may influence viral replication . it was also documented that sars-cov and its accessory protein are potent activators of pro-il-1beta gene transcription and protein maturation , and thus are able to activate the nlrp3 inflammasome and that influenza virus m2 or encephalomyocarditis virus 2b proteins stimulate il-1beta secretion following activation of the nlrp3 inflammasome , thus making colchicine a promising treatment for these conditions . \n\n potential effects of colchicine in sars-cov-2 infection . a ) sars-cov-2 provokes a dysregulated activation of the neutrophils that could contrasted by the anti-neutrophilic effect of colchicine . b ) sars-cov-2 activates the inflammasome with release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-1beta , colchicine acts to inhibit the assembly of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ( nlrp3 ) inflammasome activation and lowers il-1beta levels and possible onset of a cytokine storm . c ) sars-cov-2 may use microtubules for replication machinery for instance in the formation of double-membrane , colchicine is an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization and microtubule generation . d ) during covid-19-infection a wide release of pro-inflammatory cytokines , including il-1 , il-6 and tnf , has been observed , a phenomena that can be antagonized by colchicine . \n\n fig . 2 \n\n indeed , acute respiratory syndrome related to covid-19-infection is associated with a wide release of pro-inflammatory cytokines , including interleukin il-1 and il-6 . specifically , the binding of covid-19 to the toll like receptors leads to the lung inflammation , fever and fibrosis . thus , it might be useful to obtain a suppression of pro-inflammatory il-1 family members and il-6 to reach a therapeutic effect in viral infections . moreover , a dysregulated activation and inflammatory activity of myeloid cells is one the main pathogenic events characterizing the infection by coronaviruses . colchicine is a well- known inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory mechanisms induced by neutrophils thus it was proposed as an adjuvant treatment for rsv bronchiolitis . thus , colchicine has broad anti-inflammatory effects , anti-viral properties summarized in fig . 2 , and it is not hampered by an immunosuppressant effect . it is cheap , which may be of great usefulness in the uneventful case of an outbreak in countries that may not sustain expensive biologic treatments . colchicine has a narrow therapeutic index ; gastrointestinal disturbance may be seen in up to 10 % of patients possibly limiting its usage in covid-19 due to the relatively frequent occurrence of diarrhea in these patients . nonetheless , potential intravenous administration may reduce this side effect and increase its bioavailability . it could be suggested that colchicine may be trialed in an appropriate covid-19 patient population to reduce both viral entry and inflammatory status . in this view , an open-label , phase 2 study enrolling patients with covid-19 disease to evaluate the efficacy and safety of colchicine has been recently promoted by the italian society of rheumatology ( sir ) , the italian society of infectious and tropical diseases ( simit ) and by the italian thoracic society ( aipo ) and has been approved by the italian drug agency ( aifa ) . \n\n encouraging results are provided by the case reported by gandolfini et al . who treated a patient with signs of systemic inflammation ( plasmatic il-6 : 108.2 pg/ml ; normal range 0-10 pg/ml ) , who received colchicine ( 1 mg on day 8 , and 0.5 mg/day thereafter ) with benefit due to worsening pf respiratory functions . so far , the patients is stable , reinforcing that this is a suitable option in patients with covid-19 disease . \n\n anti-interleukin 1 \n\n as known , the innate immune response of the host against infections plays a crucial role in inducing pro-inflammatory host factors , leading to tissue damage . il-1 is a pleiotropic cytokine with a key role in inflammation , immunity , and hemopoiesis . the major of il-1 agonistic molecules are il-1alpha and il-1beta , which bind to il-1r type i ( il-1r1 ) inducing similar biologic functions . the precursor of il-1alpha ( proil-1alpha ) is constitutively expressed in several tissue cells and its expression increases during stress or inflammation , whereas il-1beta is produced mainly by myeloid cells upon inflammatory stimulation and is active as a secreted molecule . il-1beta is up-regulated during respiratory viral infections . interestingly , community-acquired pneumonia ( cap ) observed in children below 5 years of age in india has been related to a phenotype-genotype association with pro-inflammatory cytokines . specifically , il-1ra gene polymorphism and cytokine levels were linked with an adverse outcome in severe cap . \n\n authors reported that il-1beta mediates virus-induced m2 muscarinic receptor dysfunction and airway hyper-reactivity during parainfluenza virus infection . data from the literature reported that il-1beta and il-17a are key mediators of neutrophilic inflammation in influenza-induced exacerbations of chronic lung inflammation . using a mouse model of disease , authors demonstrated the crucial role of il-1beta in driving neutrophilic recruitment and inflammation during the whole phase of viral infection . blocking of il-17a or il-1 resulted to be potential targets for therapeutic treatment of viral exacerbations of chronic lung inflammation . authors described that inflammasome complex/il-1beta are an essential signaling pathway , which is over activated and directly causes the severe liver disease during viral infection . \n\n anakinra ( ank ) , a human il-1r antagonist , has been approved for the treatment of ra , aosd , and other severe autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders including tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome ( traps ) . the objective of il-1ra-based therapy is to occupy enough il-1 receptors with il-1ra to block il-1 cell signaling . rilonacept and canakinumab are other molecules currently used in clinical practice to treat autoinflammatory diseases . rilonacept is a long-acting soluble decoy receptor that binds to both il-1alpha and il-1beta and prevents their interaction with the il-1 cell surface receptor . it was approved in 2008 for the treatment of adults and children 12 years of age and older with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes ( caps ) . canakinumab is a fully human anti-il-1beta antibody that is used in the therapy of aosd and other autoinflammatory conditions . evidence documented that the control of the inflammation achieved with this drug , targeting the il-1beta innate immunity pathway , can reduce inflammatory tissue damage as it is demonstrated in cardiovascular disorders such as atherosclerosis and diabetes . currently , no evidence of anti-viral properties of these drugs exists but , as widely described , sars-cov is capable of inducing a storm of pro-inflammatory cytokines . several studies suggest that cells infected by sars-cov produce elevated levels of il-1 beta which strongly contribute to the immuno-mediated damage to the lungs and other organs , resulting in acute lung injury ( ali ) and , subsequently , multi-organ dysfunction . therefore , the application of il-1 beta antagonists may reduce the severity and mortality of sars-cov-2 infection . \n\n tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors \n\n tnf-alpha is a vital cytokine mediating host immune response . inhibition of tnf leads to a significant decrease of the inflammatory response , and this approach is used in therapy of autoimmune conditions , most effectively in ra , juvenile idiopathic arthritis , psa , psoriasis ( pso ) , spondyloarthritis ( spa ) and inflammatory bowel disease . \n\n five tnf inhibitors ( tnfi ) have been developed and introduced in clinical medicine : a chimeric monoclonal antibody , infliximab , a soluble recombinant form of the tnf cellular receptor etanercept , two fully human monoclonal antibodies ( adalimumab and golimumab ) and a humanized fab fragment of anti-tnf linked to polyethylene glycol , certolizumab pegol . these tnfi show differences in molecular design , route of administration , and potency in clearing tnf-alpha . \n\n tnf gene expression can be induced primarily in cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage by a variety of inducers , including lipopolysaccharides ( lps ) and viruses . \n\n the role of specific tnf receptor ( tnfr ) family members in anti-viral immunity depends on the stage of the immune response being different in accordance with the virus type and its virulence . depending on conditions , tnfr induces cell survival/apoptosis , and programmed necrosis which may play a role in controlling viral infection . the risks of bacterial and mycobacterial infection are increased in patients receiving biological dmards therapy , particularly tnfi . these drugs are relevant immunosuppressants leading to reactivation of latent infections such as hepatitis b and tuberculosis . for instance , hepatitis b and c assessment is required prior to start a tnfi and in patients with a positive hbsag , infliximab has the most reported cases associated with hbv reactivation . \n\n receptors and ligands of the tnf family play key roles in controlling lymphocyte activation and survival during an immune response . tnf family ligands are being explored as adjuvants for viral vaccines , and agonistic antibodies to tnfr family members are being investigated for immunotherapy of chronic viral infection alone and in combination with checkpoint blockade . \n\n recent evidence demonstrated that tnfalpha has potent anti-rotavirus effects achieved by nfkappab-regulated genes via the activation of classical nf-kappab signaling and independent of type i ifn production . moreover , the use of infliximab totally abrogates the anti-rotavirus effect of tnf-alpha . tnfi have potent activity in several diseases marked by excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokine . that effect may prove useful in viral infections highly characterized by immune activation and inflammation such as hiv-1 infections . hiv-1 infection results in the depletion of cd4+/cd8+t cells with abnormalities in the cytokine network in the infected individuals . hiv-1 uses the tnfalpha signaling for expanding its reservoir . several hiv-1 proteins mimic and regulate the tnf-alpha signaling pathway . thus , tnfi has been considered as an additional therapeutic option for hiv-1 infection . evidence shows that tnf-alpha is a key mediator of virus-induced m2 muscarinic receptor dysfunction and airway hyper-responsiveness in influenza infected-animals . interestingly , in this model etanercept has been shown to be able in preventing virus-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and m2 receptor dysfunction , without changing lung viral titres . nonetheless , all these data do not support enough the use of these molecules as anti-viral drugs . the only potential beneficial mechanism in covid-19 patients could be reduction of tnf levels that appears to be increased especially in the critical stages . moreover , a possible role in covid-19 is the interaction with the ace2 receptor . indeed , sars-cov-related severe respiratory distress sees associated with the ability of the spike protein of sars-cov to down-regulate ace2 expression . in addition , sars-cov modulates with its spike protein the tnf-alpha-converting enzyme ( tace ) - activity by via the cytoplasmic domain of ace2 leading to both the viral entry and the only potential beneficial mechanism in tissue damage through tnf-alpha production . since the downregulation of ace2 by sars-cov spike protein was proposed as an etiological event in the severe lung injury , authors previously suggested that tace antagonists can block sars-cov infection and attenuate the severe clinical outcome . other studies confirmed the role of tnfalpha in promoting pathogenesis in sars-cov infection through its receptors and suggested that inhibition of tnfalpha signaling may represent viable chance for effective therapies . accordingly , evidence reports markedly higher serum levels of tnf-alpha together with il2r , il-6 , il-10 , in severe than in moderate cases of covid-19 . a phase 4 randomized , open-label , controlled trial for the efficacy and safety of adalimumab especially in those patients with particularly elevated tnf levels in the critical stages with severe covid-19 is ongoing in shanghai with the main outcome of time to clinical improvement . \n\n tocilizumab \n\n il-6 is a cytokine produced by innate immune cells , mostly monocytes and macrophages , and also by mesenchymal , endothelial cells and fibroblasts , after the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( pamps ) and damage-associated molecular patterns ( damps ) . il-6 stimulates acute-phase immune response and hematopoiesis and it is involved in the complex pathogenesis of autoimmune disease like ra , giant cell arteritis ( gca ) , systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( sjia ) , and of cytokine release syndrome ( crs ) . crs is a possible consequence of the administration of chimeric antigen receptor engineered t cells ( car-t ) immunotherapy , recently approved for the treatment of b-cell leukemias and lymphomas . tocilizumab , a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against il-6 receptor , is capable to reduce and control the effects of the abnormal production of il-6 and is approved by fda and ema for the treatment of ra and these diseases . crs related to car-t therapy can be caused directly by the infused car-t cells or through the activation of other immune cells and usually manifests with a clinical presentation that can range from a smolder condition to a multiple organ failure . since covid-19 has some clinical similarities eventually progressing in the 15 % of cases in ards , acute cardiac injury and acute kidney disease requiring icu monitoring and a key role seems played by il-6 that is markedly elevated along with tnf-alpha , ifn-gamma , il-2 , il-10 , il-8 and granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor ( gm-csf ) , the use of tocilizumab ( iv 8 mg/kg i.v . ) was proposed . \n\n indeed , retrospective analysis of 452 patients admitted in the tongji hospital for covid-19 showed that inflammatory cytokine levels in patients with severe infection compared with non-severe , were significantly elevated , including il-6 , il-2r , il-8 , il-10 , and tnf-alpha . analogous findings were reported by lei et al . in a cohort of 29 chinese patients : the levels of il-2r and il-6 in peripheral blood of patients with covid-19 pneumonia were significantly increased and related to the severity of the disease . \n\n even though tocilizumab does not seem to have any direct anti-viral effect , the elevated serum levels of il-6 in severe covid and the evidence of a cytokine pattern similar to crs led to the hypothesis of the use of this drug as treatment of severe respiratory infections whose manifestations could be correlated to the abnormal innate immune response stimulated by il-6 . a randomized controlled clinical trial is actually undergoing in china and another has been started in italy , as abovementioned . tocilizumab has already been used in the past weeks as an off-label drug in the absence of a specific therapy for the treatment of severe manifestations of covid ( icu and not-icu patients ) in italy during the epidemic outbreak that is leading to an emergency situation with more than 4000 victims . notably , another anti-il6 drug is currently available for the treatment of ra , sarilumab , a human monoclonal antibody against the il-6 receptor . tocilizumab is available both iv as well as subcutaneously , while sarilumab only subcutaneously , possibly limiting its usage due to the slower effect in an acute scenario as that of ards or pre-ards from sars-cov-2 infection . \n\n ivig \n\n intravenous ( iv ) immunoglobulins ( ig ) , therapeutic preparations of pooled normal serum derived poly-specific igg are widely used for the treatment of several immune-mediated conditions and rheumatologic diseases . the immunomodulating properties of ivig seem to be related to a complex and not yet understood direct action both on innate immune components ( complement , monocytes , macrophages , natural killer , cells ) and on adaptive immune cells such as cd4 t-cells and b-cells . \n\n far before the use of ivig as immunomodulating therapy , serum ig were identified as one of the cardinal constituents of the adaptive immune system against microorganisms ( especially viruses , bacteria ) . the bond of ig to viral superficial antigen is capable to prevent virus cell penetration , induce phagocytosis and clearance of viral structure by macrophages and neutrophils and finally to activate nk cells to eliminate infected cells . enriched ig preparation extracted from human placenta and then from human serum can be considered the first anti-viral drug and the first example of the use of immunotherapy against an infection . \n\n intramuscular ig were first used to prevent hav and measles in the '40s later in the '80s of intravenous preparation with reduced anaphylaxis risk , specific ig preparations developed from donors with high titers of desired antibodies ( the so called hyperimmune preparations ) were used to prevent and treat a variety of viral infections ( hav , rabies , cmv , varicella zoster virus ( vzv ) , measles etc . ) . \n\n as derivatives from blood of healthy donors , ivig contains a panel of polyclonal ig directed against a wide variety of common microorganisms . in an interesting work krause et al . evaluated the presence of specific antimicrobial activity in 5 commercial kit of ivig showing that all of these preparations have significant activities against hsv , cmv , vzv , ebv , measles , mumps , rubella , parvovirus b19 . for these reasons , ivig are employed as a substitute treatment for patients with hypogammaglobulinemia ( primary or secondary deficiency ] and childhood acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids ) to prevent common opportunistic viral and bacterial infection . many examples in literature were reported about the use of ivig as prevention or treatment for opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patient secondary to immunosuppressive therapy , aids and bone marrow transplantation ( bmt ) . \n\n cmv is a common herpes virus that infects around 90 % of the general population . in transplant patients , ivig administered with acyclovir and ganciclovir seem to be capable of preventing cmv related complications . a retrospective study by ljungman et al . showed no additional benefit of ivig in combination to the standard anti-viral therapy compared to anti-viral therapy alone , in the treatment of cmv gastrointestinal disease in bmt . some case series showed that ivig could be a possible treatment strategy for active cmv infections in immunocompromised patients . \n\n common respiratory viruses like human metapneumovirus ( hmpv ) , adenovirus ( adv ) and rsv emerged as important etiological players in serious respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients following bmt and renal transplantation . ivig demonstrated direct anti-viral activity in vitro against hmpv and rsv . many case reports and case series highlighted the efficacy of a regimen which included ribavirin or cidofovir and ivig with complete resolution of symptoms in pneumonia caused by the abovementioned viruses . \n\n ivig were also used as prophylaxis for vzv infection in newborns exposed to the virus after birth and were effective for the treatment of a disseminated vzv infection . \n\n ivig seem able to reduce the recurrence of genital manifestations of hsv 2 and were shown to reduce the burden of bk polyomavirus in a proportion of transplant patients . \n\n west nile ( wn ) fever is caused by a flavivirus and provokes encephalitis and meningitis . in a mouse model , commercial ivig from israel , in which the disease is endemic , showed efficacy to prevent the development of such disease if administrated during the viremic phase ( i.e. , administered 1 day before and after the inoculation of the virus ) . the efficacy was directly proportional to the dose administered . interestingly , ivig derived from usa donors , in which the disease is not endemic , showed no protective effect . \n\n on the other way , ig specific serum antibodies could be also associated with an increased risk of infection by promoting viral entry in susceptible cells through a mechanism of antibody-dependent enhancement ( ade ) , firstly described for flaviviridae , hiv and ebola viruses , which involves specific cellular receptors like fc receptor ( fcr ) or complement receptor type 3 ( cr3 ) . this process has been recently proposed by fu et al . as a possible mechanism of lung damage in sars-cov pneumonia . in particular , the viral surface antigen s-host antibodies ( anti-spike igg ) complex promotes the fcr-mediated internalization of the virus in macrophages ( ade ) and activates intracellular signaling of fcr . this interaction results in the up-regulation and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines responsible for severe lung disease . moreover , it was observed that the appearance of anti-viral igg coincided in 80 % of patients with the onset of acute respiratory disease . the same study identified ivig as an agent able to saturate fcr and possibly prevent the lung damage in sars-cov infection . despite a systematic review of sars treatment showed inconclusive results in a retrospective analysis of ivig treated patients , a possible therapeutic role of ivig in covid-19 could be hypothesized . \n\n janus kinases inhibitors \n\n janus kinases ( jaks ) are intracellular signaling components that function downstream of many cytokines . four members are included in the jak family : jak1 , jak2 , jak3 , and non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase ( tyk2 ) . all jaks play a key role in immune response , and jak1/2 are also involved in hematopoiesis . jak-1 and jak-2 ( jak 1/2 ) kinase are found in the cell cytoplasm and are associated with key cytokine receptors and activating kinases . upon activation , jak 1/2 induce downstream activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription ( stat ) protein , with transduction of the signal and the final transcription of several genes involved in immune cells proliferation , differentiation , activation/inhibition , and survival/apoptosis . \n\n in the immune response to pathogens including viruses , the signaling occurs via the jak-stat pathway , including type i ( regulated by jak1-tyk2 complexes ) and type ii ifns ( mediated via jak1-jak2 complexes ) . the ifns are a primary defense against pathogens because of their strong anti-viral activities . as known , ifn-alpha is an important therapeutic option for the successful treatment of hbv and hcv and have effects against hepatitis e infection and for chronic delta hepatitis . \n\n jak1 is required for both type i ( alpha and beta ) and type ii ( gamma ) ifn signaling pathways , while jak3 is crucial for lymphocyte development and function . viral infections induce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 , il-6 , tnf , il-8 , as well as chemokines . generally , ifn-alpha/beta would be considerably upregulated by viral infections : studies found that distinct anti-viral activities correlate with virus-specific expression levels of interferon-stimulated genes ( isgs ) subsets . for instance , some isgs have strong anti-viral effects while others promote viral replication in vitro . macrophages produce significant levels of ifn-alpha/beta , il-1beta , tnf-alpha , chemokines , and il-18 . dendritic cells ( dcs ) , especially plasmacytoid dcs , respond to virus infections dose dependently by inducing high expression of ifn-alpha/beta or on the contrary by a rapid pdc apoptosis . moreover , ifn-alpha downregulates ifn-gamma production by nk and cd8+ t cells through il-10 production , leading to a rapid induction of an adaptive immune response . \n\n jak inhibitors ( jaki ) are small molecules targeting the intracellular cytokine signaling . there are a number of jaki currently both used and under investigation for use in several autoimmune systemic diseases such as ra , pso , psa , some of which are also approved or under investigation in other indications . tofacitinib has specificity for jak3 and jak1 over jak2 and baricitinib mainly inhibits jak1 and jak2 while upadacitinib that will be soon marketed demonstrated a 74- and 58-fold greater selectivity for jak1 over jak2 and jak3 , respectively . \n\n jaki have anti-viral potential since may lower the pro-inflammatory response mediated by viruses . for instance , baricitinib induces a dose dependent inhibition of il-6 . intriguingly , baricitinib inhibits the ap2-associated protein kinase 1 ( aak1 ) that is a regulator of endocytosis that the sars-cov-2 uses to infect lung cells through binding with ace2 . this may possibly interrupt the passage of the virus into cells and also the intracellular assembly of virus particles . baricitinib , at therapeutic dosing ( either as 2 mg or 4 mg once daily ) is sufficient to inhibit aak1 , thus it has been suggested to be trialed in an appropriated covid population . on the other hand , therapies targeting jak complexes may interfere with normal anti-viral response including inhibition of ifn-gamma activity and may potentially increase the risk of infection and/or reactivation of several viral infectious diseases , including a dose dependent risk for vzv observed for tofacitinib and baricitinib . thus , their usage should be carefully evaluated . moreover , selective jaki , such as fedratinib , a jak2 targeted jaki able to inhibit th17-mediated response implicated in the disease cytokine release syndrome , may be more beneficial than others . \n\n granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor \n\n granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor ( gm-csf ) is a fundamental cytokine and growth factor involved in the proliferation and maturation of myeloid precursors , such as granulocytes , monocytes and macrophages that express its receptor . in fact , it is widely used to reverse neutropenia induced by cytotoxic agents . however , there is extensive evidence that gm-csf is able to prime macrophages to transcribe and secrete cytokines , such as il-6 and tnf-alpha , responsible for common adverse events such as fever and myalgia . \n\n following the outbreak of covid-19 , huang et al . demonstrated that patients display markedly increased plasma levels of gm-csf compared to healthy population , suggesting gm-csf may play a role in the context of crs . additionally , pathologic studies demonstrated a significant macrophage infiltration in lungs of patients who died with sars-cov infection , which shares significant similarities with covid-19 . \n\n recently , a more detailed analysis has been performed on t cells from peripheral blood of covid-19 patients . very interestingly , high levels of cd4+ cells expressing both gm-csf and il-6 were found in covid-19 patients , along with gm-csf-secreting cd14+cd16+ , compared to healthy controls . even more intriguingly , th1 cells expressing both gm-csf and ifn-gamma were detected exclusively in icu patients , thus suggesting a potential contribution of gm-csf to crs . these data are further supported by the evidence that human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells ( hpmec ) are able to secrete gm-csf following an inflammatory stimulus such as lps , suggesting a potential important role in the pathogenesis of ards , in which increased levels of gm-csf are present in bal fluid . additionally , animal models have demonstrated that gm-csf neutralization is effective in reducing the severity of neuroinflammation induced by car-t therapy , with no negative effect on its efficacy . \n\n multiple gm-csf and gm-csf receptor inhibitors ( namilumab , mavrilimumab , otilimab ) are currently under investigation for the treatment of ra and preliminary data seem promising . the blockade of this pathway may represent an additional interesting experimental approach to treat crs in covid-19 patients . \n\n concluding

00001000	anosmia and the need for covid-19 screening during the pandemic . \n\n in this commentary , we briefly summarize the available data from iran and other countries on the sudden increase in anosmia , hyposmia , and hypogeusia that has coincided with the covid-19 pandemic . alarmingly , a high proportion of patients with severe covid-19 had isolated anosmia as the sole initial presenting symptom , which is likely due to the direct neuropathic effect of the virus rather than being secondary to nasal congestion and obstruction . since isolated anosmia is not yet considered a prerequisite for screening for covid-19 , we wish to raise awareness on the association of anosmia with covid-19 , urging international and national health authorities to consider this association in their efforts for early detection and isolation of infected individuals and for breaking the chain of transmission . we urge our colleagues who assess patients with new-onset anosmia to strictly adhere to the safety guidelines to reduce the risk of exposure and infection during this nascent pandemic . 
01000000	traditional chinese medicine : an effective treatment for 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia ( ncp ) . \n\n the novel coronavirus pneumonia broke out in 2019 and spread rapidly . in 30 different countries , there are over seventy thousand patients have been diagnosed in total . therefore , it is urgent to develop the effective program to prevent and treat for the novel coronavirus pneumonia . in view of traditional chinese medicine has accumulated a solid theoretical foundation of plague in ancient and recent decades . meanwhile , traditional chinese medicine can provide the more effective and personalized treatment via adjusting the specific medicine for each patient based on the different syndromes . in addition , tcm often has different effect on the distinct stages of diseases , contributing to the prevention , treatment and rehabilitation . nowadays , tcm has exhibited decent effect in the in the fight against ncp . therefore , it is convinced that traditional chinese medicine is an effective treatment for 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia . 
10000000	emergence of a novel coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) and the importance of diagnostic testing : why partnership between clinical laboratories , public health agencies , and industry is essential to control the outbreak \n\n introduction \n\n in late december 2019 , chinese health authorities investigated a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases occurring primarily in individuals who had visited a seafood and wet market in wuhan , hubei province , china . patients reported fever and cough , and most developed chest discomfort and/or respiratory distress , with a diagnosis of pneumonia being made by chest radiographs and/or computed tomographic ( ct ) scan . after testing for common causes of respiratory infection yielded negative results , unbiased sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage ( bal ) fluid identified a variant beta-coronavirus with nearly 85 % sequence homology to that of a bat severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) -like coronavirus ( cov ) . the virus was subsequently isolated in eukaryotic cell culture , and further characterization showed it to be distinct from sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) -cov , with sequence homology of approximately 79 % and about 50 % , respectively . the variant cov , which has been named sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , represents the seventh cov to cause disease in humans , and the third cov since 2003 to cross over from animals to humans and be associated with severe respiratory illness . the world health organization ( who ) has named the illness caused by sars-cov-2 coronavirus disease-2019 ( covid-19 ) . \n\n to date , there have been approximately 95 000 confirmed cases of covid-19 in over 80 different countries . however , the majority of cases ( about 85 % ) have occurred in mainland china . following an incubation period ranging from 2 to 13 days , most ( > 80 % ) symptomatic patients have reported a fever and cough , and some have developed shortness of breath . although covid-19 is generally thought to be a milder illness compared to sars and mers-cov , nearly 3200 deaths have occurred , yielding a case-fatality rate of about 3 % ( versus approximately 10 % for sars-cov and approximately 35 % for mers-cov ) . this mortality rate is likely an overestimation , due to the high probability that many infected individuals have not sought medical attention and laboratory confirmation . it is important to emphasize that details regarding this outbreak are rapidly evolving , and therefore , the full extent of covid-19 's impact is still unknown . that being said , the nonspecific clinical features of covid-19 , along with the co-circulation of other respiratory viruses ( e.g. , influenza , respiratory syncytial virus ) in many parts of the world , have presented a major challenge to public health officials and healthcare providers . this outbreak represents an opportunity for government agencies , the public health sector , industry , and clinical laboratories to partner and develop a robust and sustainable system that would allow for rapid development , production , dissemination , and implementation of diagnostic tests for infectious agents of global health concern . \n\n diagnostic testing for covid-19 \n\n in the weeks following the initial characterization of covid-19 , the chinese and american centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) rapidly developed molecular assays for detection of the variant virus in clinical samples . other groups have also described the development of real-time pcr methods to diagnose covid-19 , mainly targeting various combinations of the open reading frame ( orf ) , envelope ( e ) , nucleocapsid ( n ) , and rna-dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) genes . on february 4 , 2020 , the united states food and drug administration ( fda ) took an important step , issuing an emergency use authorization for the us cdc 's covid-19 real-time pcr assay , thereby enabling cdc-qualified laboratories to perform the test . currently , there are 115 cdc-qualified laboratories in the us ( i.e. , state and local public health laboratories and department of defense laboratories ) , and 191 qualified laboratories worldwide . however , to date , clinical laboratories in the us have not had access to the cdc covid-19 assay , leaving a gap in the ability of healthcare providers to rapidly diagnose and manage patients who present with a respiratory illness during this emerging outbreak . \n\n closing the gap : the importance of performing diagnostics at the front line \n\n during an outbreak such as covid-19 , healthcare providers may evaluate patients whose clinical presentation and travel/exposure history renders them a `` patient under investigation '' ( pui ) for the disease . although many of these patients ultimately test negative for the outbreak-associated virus , the initial uncertainty regarding the cause of disease often has an important impact on management decisions . for example , puis are often placed in conservative isolation precautions ( e.g. , airborne isolation ) , and healthcare teams may defer or avoid certain procedures , which may have otherwise been performed to treat , stabilize , and/or diagnose a patient 's condition . furthermore , clinical laboratories may limit , or significantly modify , their testing approach for a pui , due to safety concerns for healthcare providers and laboratory personnel . as an example , the cdc has issued interim laboratory biosafety guidelines for handling specimens from suspect cases of covid-19 , and these guidelines recommend against viral culture and state that any procedure with the potential to generate an aerosol ( e.g , . vortexing , sonication , pipetting of respiratory samples ) be carried out in a certified class ii biosafety cabinet . these modifications to routine clinical and laboratory practice are required to ensure the safety of healthcare personnel , laboratory staff , and patients , and are designed to prevent further transmission of the disease . however , any delay in establishing a diagnosis ( i.e. , resulting from transporting samples to an off-site laboratory or from making modifications to the standard operating procedures of a clinical laboratory that may limit its diagnostic approach ) has the potential to negatively impact patient outcomes . \n\n to provide physicians with the answers they need to manage patients effectively during an outbreak setting , laboratory testing is needed at the front lines , whenever feasible and safe . this is especially true during an outbreak such as covid-19 , which is a nonspecific illness during the early stages , similar to other more common infectious diseases such as influenza . so how do we provide rapid answers , while ensuring that the testing is accurate , reproducible , and robust ? the author proposes the following as a high-level framework for consideration and discussion . \n\n building an adaptable infrastructure for rapid dissemination of laboratory diagnostics \n\n if there has been one enduring lesson from sars-cov , the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic , mers-cov , ebola , zika , and now covid-19 , it is that the next novel or emerging viral outbreak is likely just around the corner . therefore , a general framework to guide our response to outbreaks of global health concern is needed . this should involve the expertise and direction of government agencies ( e.g. , fda/cdc ) , state and local public health departments , industry partners , clinical laboratories , and healthcare providers . \n\n during the early stages of an outbreak , national ( i.e. , cdc ) and international ( i.e. , world health organization ) agencies are best positioned to develop new diagnostic tests rapidly , given their 1 ) involvement in investigating cases ; 2 ) role in characterizing the disease ; and 3 ) access to clinical samples from patients with the illness . once an assay has been developed and shown to meet established performance characteristic standards , a proposed next step would be for the national/international public health agency to partner with a contracted test manufacturer ( s ) to initiate the process of mass production of test reagents and submission of performance data to the fda . as is currently the process , the fda would then review the test performance characteristics , and if acceptable , issue an emergency use authorization . this would then allow for the test manufacturer to distribute kits to qualified laboratories , which , in the proposed model , would be expanded to include not only state and local public health laboratories , but also clinical laboratories that have participated in a thorough vetting and credentialing process . this process could involve 1 ) an application/registration from the clinical laboratory confirming that they have the required equipment , safety infrastructure , and personnel to complete testing ; 2 ) a site-visit from an existing , cdc-qualified laboratory representative ; and 3 ) successful completion of required validation studies and a blinded verification panel sent from the cdc and/or test manufacturer to the clinical laboratory . ideally , steps # 1 and # 2 would be performed outside of ( i.e. , prior to ) an outbreak setting , and would serve as an accreditation that the clinical laboratory is qualified to be a testing site for a specified period of time ( e.g. , 5 years ) , after which re-accreditation would be required . although this approach would likely require modifications and special considerations to account for disease-specific features ( e.g. , route of transmission [ blood-borne versus airborne ] or recommended testing approach [ molecular versus serology ] ) , it could serve as a general framework to apply during an infectious disease outbreak that has been determined to be a global health emergency . \n\n closing thoughts and a path forward \n\n the covid-19 outbreak has once again highlighted the need to create a robust and sustainable system allowing for rapid development , dissemination , and implementation of diagnostic tests targeted against infectious diseases of global health concern . to provide healthcare providers with the answers they need to make critical patient-management decisions , rapid testing for the outbreak-associated pathogen is needed . this will require us to think creatively , so that testing for novel and emerging pathogens can be implemented in both public health laboratories and clinical laboratories in a timely fashion . to accomplish this goal , there will be substantial logistical challenges and resource limitations to overcome . however , this is certainly a challenge worth taking on , and one in which we can be successful by working together . \n\n author

00001000	covid-19 cacophony : is there any orchestra conductor ? \n\n the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) pandemic is currently invading the world , and several countries are now struggling to fight it or trying to delay its start to help smooth its peak size for the purpose of lowering morbidity and mortality , and thereby reduce the overall tension on their health-care system . china 's first major outbreaks of covid-19 happened in january , 2020 . then south korea , iran , and italy entered into this ravel 's bolero-like epidemic in late february and early march , 2020 , and many other countries are preparing to play the same rhythmic pattern in the coming days and weeks . \n\n all countries have to react and take action without any conducting from who . who 's director-general declared on jan , 30 , 2020 , a public health emergency of international concern , which allowed him to release subsequent recommendations , but none were issued with regard to what to do , and when to do it , at the country level . with no vaccine or antivirals , the portfolio of countermeasures against covid-19 is limited . only a small set of evidence-based non-pharmaceutical interventions are available . \n\n measures like self-quarantine , or temperature control at borders , are not expected to be very effective since half of infections are asymptomatic . there is consensus today to propose school closure , restrict social gathering ( including shutdown of workplaces ) , limit population movements , and introduce so-called cordons sanitaires , which means quarantines at the scale of cities or regions . there is less consensus about which measure should start first , in which combination , and when . \n\n there is no direct scientific evidence regarding wearing protective masks in public spaces for asymptomatic people , but mask protection is heavily practised in asian populations and seems deeply despised in western cultures . there is no common policy about which measures should be considered , and at which epidemiological threshold such measures should be implemented . nobody knows at which level restrictions on mass gathering should be imposed . \n\n the recent chinese experience of combining non-pharmaceutical interventions to curb outbreak trends seems rather convincing . although starting late in the process , authoritarian chinese authorities succeeded in combining forced isolation of the population with all available social distancing interventions . the democratic italian government , followed by the governments of france , spain , and other countries , set up most of these measures quickly in the epidemic process but lacked any international guidance or recommendations . would they not have expected to see who headquarters as the orchestra conductor at this stage of the process ? do member states not need some level of harmonisation and coordination when implementing the four available non-pharmaceutical interventions ; to help them decide whether , when , and how to implement them ; if , when , and how to combine them ; and to what extent ? in addition , the chinese government has no guidance nor recommendation about lifting measures that have been in place in wuhan since jan 23 , 2020 . to what extent , at which pace , and how should they start lifting their intervention and allow people to resume normal social and economic life ? \n\n who remains surprisingly silent and absent in all of these pragmatic questions . \n\n references \n\n statement on the second meeting of the international health regulations ( 2005 ) emergency committee regarding the outbreak of novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov ) \n\n nonpharmaceutical interventions for pandemic influenza , international measures \n\n nonpharmaceutical interventions for pandemic influenza , national and community measures \n\n effectiveness of interventions to reduce contact rates during simulated influenza pandemic \n\n nonpharmaceutical interventions implemented by us cities during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic \n\n considerations relating to social distancing measures in response to the covid-19 epidemic 
00001000	changes in urology after the first wave of the covid-19 pandemic \n\n take home message \n\n the covid-19 pandemic has changed the world . urology needs to overcome these challenges . our duty is to provide care under any circumstances and our privilege is to re-examine and advance our field . the use of novel communication and health technologies will ensure safety while maintaining high-quality care . \n\n introduction \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) . the global spread of the virus has overwhelmed health systems and caused widespread social and economic disruption . most countries have reacted by putting their society and the economy on hold to limit the ability of the virus to spread . urology specifically has shifted to emergency mode , with many elective procedures cancelled . \n\n until a vaccine or a cure for covid-19 is developed , we have to adjust to be able to maintain a steady state of low-level transmission . this will undoubtedly affect the medical world and urological practice dramatically . this document sets a platform for discussing the adaptations required . we acknowledge that health systems differ between countries , but here we try to highlight common themes . \n\n patient and staff safety and a sense of security ; \n\n disruption of the continuity of care ; and \n\n prioritization of delays . \n\n general concerns ubiquitous to all medical practice : \n\n most urological patients are older than 65 yr . this age group is particularly affected by covid-19 . \n\n many invasive procedures performed are performed on an outpatient basis ( cystoscopy , urodynamics , prostate biopsies , intravesical treatment ) . \n\n timeline of goals for the immediate and long-term future . \n\n fig . 1 \n\n most surgeries are elective and can be delayed for several months , but patients may suffer if these are delayed for a long period ( fig . 1 ) . \n\n urology-specific concerns : \n\n outpatient clinics \n\n enhancing a sense of security : it is essential that patients and staff feel safe . to this end , each clinic will need multiple hand sanitation booths , weekly staff testing for sars-cov-2 , and identifiable signs ( eg , sars-cov-2-negative tested ) . \n\n minimizing patient waiting times for physicians : most centers now have electronic data and measurements for waiting times . we suggest personalization of physician-patient time interactions on the basis of behavioral analyses . \n\n telemedicine : while the initial diagnosis needs to be in-person with protective measures , most follow-up visits could be performed via telemedicine . medical insurers will need to consider reimbursement fees for this approach . \n\n personal protective equipment ( ppe ) : each facility will have to decide which invasive procedures require ppe and what kind of ppe to use . \n\n as there is some evidence that sars-cov-2 may also be transmitted via the feco-oral route , we suggest performing prostate biopsies and urodynamics on a day surgery basis . \n\n immediate \n\n integration of patient-reported outcomes ( proms ) with telemedicine : telemedicine creates distance between the patient and physician . in urology , many issues are very intimate and it is vital to establish adequate doctor-patient rapport . \n\n telemedicine communication skills : as telemedicine is a new tool we will have to master communication via video . \n\n integrated practice units ( ipus ) : the world of medicine is moving towards value-based medicine . what this essentially means is shifting the focus from the volume and profitability of services provided : physician visits , hospitalizations , and procedures : to the patient outcomes achieved . as a field , we should seize the opportunities provided by telecommunication and technology to transform our approach . \n\n at the core of value transformation is changing the way we are organized . in urology , this requires a shift from the current organization by service to organization around the patient 's medical condition . this structure is termed an ipu . in an ipu , a dedicated team made up of clinical and nonclinical personnel provides the full care cycle for the patient 's condition . many institutes already have multidisciplinary uro-oncology clinics , so moving to ipus would be an easy transition . \n\n intermediate term ( 1-2 yr ) \n\n creating a physical barrier between the main hospital and clinics : we may have a second or third wave of infection and we need to think of how to move outpatient clinics away from the main hospital . \n\n connected clinics : the covid-19 pandemic will enhance the development of novel tools for monitoring patients at home . these will use technology to inform personalized medicine and care ( eg , daily home urine tests to change nutrition for stone formers ) . \n\n long term ( > 2 yr ) \n\n urological outpatient clinics will have to adapt to new social distancing regulations that may differ between countries . the common theme will be to minimize unnecessary interactions while maintaining high-quality treatment by integrating novel technologies such as telemedicine . telemedicine was developed to allow health care professionals to treat patients in remote locations . now it will have widespread use . \n\n operating rooms \n\n telemedicine preoperative clinics ; \n\n sars-cov-2 test for each elective patient 24 h before surgery ; \n\n isolated operating rooms for sars-cov-2-positive patients ; \n\n prioritization of delayed surgeries ; and \n\n integration of most short-stay surgeries into the outpatient day surgery schedule . \n\n immediate \n\n integration of novel technology for preoperative teleclinics ( eg , use camera to assess intubation ease , use 4-m walk test to determine surgical risk ) . \n\n intermediate term ( 1-2 yr ) \n\n operative plans are needed to make sure that elective surgery continues if a second or third wave of covid-19 occurs . most surgical teams are not needed for providing covid-19 care and are unemployed . \n\n long term ( > 2 yr ) \n\n there are several specific concerns regarding the operating room . first is the safety of staff and patients . there are case reports of severe complication for covid-19 patients undergoing surgery . however , some covid-19-positive patients will need emergency surgery . second , most countries have stopped elective surgeries completely and therefore many urological procedures have been delayed . \n\n department level \n\n transfer short-stay surgeries to day procedures outside the department ; \n\n establish an intermediate unit for long-stay surgeries ( eg , cystectomy ) ; \n\n establish a separate place for emergency admissions ; \n\n prevent patient-to-staff transmission ; \n\n divide medical staff into teams with no overlap contact between them to avoid staff-to-staff and patient-to-staff transmission ; \n\n initiate staff meetings via videoconferencing ; \n\n address medical education and residency : ensure that residents teams include senior , intermediate , and new residents and that videoconference teaching is in place ; and \n\n establish a framework for teams in the era of social distancing : patient care requires an integrated team of physicians , nurses , paramedics , and administrators who need to be able to maintain their teamwork from a distance . \n\n immediate \n\n the main concern at department level is avoiding infectious spread . this could include staff-to-staff , staff-to-patient , patient-to-staff , and patient-to-patient transmission . to this end , departments will have to work in small integrated teams with minimal contact between teams . the challenge will be to maintain the departmental structure and medical education despite these restrictions . \n\n research \n\n establish a database of delayed treatments and surgeries to understand the possible effects on outcome ; \n\n establish an international database of surgical patients with covid-19 before surgery or during recovery ; and \n\n establish prospective databases to be able to evaluate compliance , satisfaction , and outcomes for the new pathways developed for diagnosis , treatment , and follow-up for our patients ( ie , telemedicine ) . \n\n it is vital that even in these unprecedented times we should focus not only on current events but also on what actions we can take in the future . \n\n in summary , we are in the midst of a worldwide pandemic with catastrophic consequences . we need to adjust the way we think regarding how we carry out even very simple tasks . however , as doctors we need to make sure that our patients will be able to have access to safe medicine . we should also seize this opportunity to advance our field moving forward . \n\n : : conflicts of interest : the authors have nothing to disclose . \n\n references \n\n world health organization . coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) pandemic . www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/ . \n\n isolation , quarantine , social distancing and community containment : pivotal role for old-style public health measures in the novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov ) outbreak \n\n world health organization . strategic preparedness and response plan . www.who.int/publications-detail/strategic-preparedness-and-response-plan-for-the-new-coronavirus/ . \n\n care for critically ill patients with covid-19 \n\n\n\n turning teams and pathways into integrated practice units : appearance characteristics and added value \n\n 
01110000	emerging genetic diversity among clinical isolates of sars-cov-2 : lessons for today \n\n considering the current pandemic of covid-19 , it is imperative to gauge the role of molecular divergence in sars-cov-2 with time , due to clinical and epidemiological concerns . our analyses involving molecular phylogenetics is a step toward understanding the transmission clusters that can be correlated to pathophysiology of the disease to gain insight into virulence mechanism . as the infections are increasing rapidly , more divergence is expected followed possibly by viral adaptation . we could identify mutational hotspots which appear to be major drivers of diversity among strains , with rbd of spike protein emerging as the key region involved in interaction with ace2 and consequently a major determinant of infection outcome . we believe that such molecular analyses correlated with clinical characteristics and host predisposition need to be evaluated at the earliest to understand viral adaptability , disease prognosis , and transmission dynamics . \n\n highlights \n\n our analyses revealed a great deal of genetic diversity emerging among clinical isolates of sars-cov-2 . \n\n every continent seems to have multiple introductions of different viral strains . \n\n 5 ' terminal of the viral genome is more prone to mutations compared to 3 ' end . \n\n orf1ab , spike , orf3a and e are key protein prone to mutations . \n\n receptor binding domain of spike protein emerged as mutational hotspot . \n\n our phylogenetic analyses reveal at least five different clades of sars-cov-2 . \n\n humanity is at the verge of a serious crisis due to covid-19 pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 . the disease was reported earlier from wuhan , china in december 2019 and in a matter of weeks , witnessed a meteoric spread to almost every part of the world . new emerging epicentres like italy , iran , spain and usa have amplified the crisis . the looming disaster of its spread to over populated countries with fragile health infrastructure necessitates even more urgently to implement population-centred approaches to understand this outbreak and fight the pandemic . ngs has helped the community to explore the evolutionary diversity and mutational propensity of the virus . efforts of medical and scientific fraternity have been unprecedented with genetic data being available at exhilarating speed along with rapid epidemiological and clinical data sharing - all aiming to translate these into developing effective interventions . \n\n visual depiction of emerging genomic diversity among clinical isolates of sars-cov-2 ( a ) sars-cov-2 separating into different clades since its identification in december 2019 till march 2020 using wuhan-hu-1 ( nc_045512 ) as reference strain ( courtesy : nextstrain.org ) . amino acid mutations in individual orf 's are also shown along clade separation . ( b ) t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding , a non-linear dimensionality reduction machine learning ( ml ) technique plot for covid-19 strains ( n = 257 , based on the global orf similarity between genomes ) highlights two dominant clusters ; europe and north america + asia ) . diffuse geographical clustering was observed for other strains across continents - an indication of the effects of human migration in the modern population . ( c ) mutation analysis of all orf 's from analysed covid-19 strains ( n = 257 ) . plots for individual amino acids in orf 's show that every type of amino acid has undergone mutations , predominantly in orf 's 1ab , s , 3a and e. ( d ) diversity in clinical isolates indicate that sars-cov-2 has divulged into at least five different clades , evolutionary distinct from bat cov ratg13 and beta-cov-pangolins . \n\n fig . 1 \n\n we analysed the genome sequence of available clinical isolates ( n = 250+ ) to comprehend the phylogenetic diversity of the isolates . the mutations arising during human to human spread could provide insights into transmission dynamics and , compounded with clinical and epidemiological data can predict disease prognosis . moreover , the mutational propensity of rna viruses can impede the development of interventions which is an emerging challenge before the scientific community . our analyses employing advanced machine learning approaches revealed a great deal of genetic diversity emerging among clinical isolates ( fig . 1a ) . one fascinating aspect that emerged is the observed diversity of viral strains in every continent ( fig . 1b ) . however , there was no geographical clustering of the isolates and every continent seems to have multiple introductions of different viral strains . earlier pandemics had geographical signatures in their sequences that abetted the tracing of new infections . those markers are obscure yet in the current pandemic possibly due to rampant globalisation , a major bottleneck in tracing the lineages . the intriguing difference in the significantly more than average transmission and mortality in the lombardy region of italy , compared to other european countries or that of african continent or even china , could not be correlated to any specific molecular divergence pattern and very likely a reflection of the advanced age/co-morbidity . intriguingly , we observed 5 ' terminal of the genome to be more variable and prone to mutations , as compared to 3 ' terminal . it appears that orf1ab , spike , orf3a and e are key drivers of diversity among strains with rbd of spike emerging as mutational hotspot ( fig . 1c ) . interaction of rbd with ace2 could determine the outcome of infection indicating the clinical importance of these mutations . our phylogenetic analyses reveal at least five different clades circulating as of date and more divergence is expected with time ( fig . 1d ) . we believe that these emerging mutations , once corroborated with viral pathogenesis and clinical characteristics along with epidemiological correlates would be valuable in predicting disease progression and also tracing pathogen mobility and re-emergence . \n\n references \n\n covid-19 - the search for effective therapy \n\n the signature features of influenza pandemics : implications for policy \n\n gisaid : global initiative on sharing all influenza data - from vision to reality \n\n a glimpse into the origins of genetic diversity in sars-cov-2 \n\n a novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in china , 2019 
01000000	antihypertensive drugs and risk of covid-19 ? \n\n lei fang and colleagues suggest that clinicians should consider withholding angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ( aceis ) or angiotensin receptor blockers ( arbs ) because of a potential increased risk of worse clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , and they suggest calcium channel blockers as an alternative . the hypothesis behind this suggestion is that the entry point for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) is the ace2 receptor and that aceis and arbs have the potential to upregulate ace2 . however , data for this mechanism are largely from animal studies of heart tissue . human data have not consistently shown increased ace2 levels . \n\n this premature hypothesis has generated confusion across various media channels and in the medical community . some medical centres have suggested withholding renin-angiotensin system ( ras ) inhibitors , despite calls from international societies ( eg , the european society of cardiology , hypertension canada , the canadian cardiovascular society , uk renal association , and the international society of hypertension ) urging against such action . fang and colleagues based their hypothesis on unadjusted observational data and proposed that patients with hypertension are at increased risk of mortality from covid-19 , attributable to ace2 as the binding protein for sars-cov-2 . although unadjusted observational data suggest that patients with hypertension are at increased risk of mortality , no data are available for the blood pressure regimen of patients with more severe or fatal covid-19 . it is equally plausible that patients with hypertension have an overactive ras , placing them at increased risk for pulmonary complications from covid-19 in view of the counter-regulatory role of ace2 on activated ras . it is also important to distinguish between use of aceis and arbs , because these drugs could have differential effects on ras components . \n\n potential therapeutic options to address at1 receptor-mediated lung injury in patients with covid-19 \n\n ( a ) mechanism in a healthy individual . ( b ) mechanism in an individual with covid-19 . at1=angiotensin 1 . at2=angiotensin 2 . ace1=angiotensin converting enzyme 1 . ace2=angiotensin converting enzyme 2 . at1r=type 1 angiotensin 2 receptor . at1-7=heptapeptide angiotensin ( 1-7 ) . acei=angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor . arb=angiotensin receptor blocker . covid-19=coronavirus disease 2019 . sars-cov-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 . \n\n similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) , sars-cov-2 binds with the ace2 receptor for intracellular invasion , and the mechanism for acute lung injury during infection has been postulated to be mediated through activation of ras . in several studies , ras blockade has been proposed as a potential treatment for covid-19 ( figure ) . angiotensin 2 ( at2 ) primarily activates the type 1 angiotensin 2 receptor ( at1r ) , which potentially mediates pulmonary inflammation , fibrosis , and oedema . ace2 activation results in low amounts of at2 and increased production of the anti-inflammatory heptapeptide angiotensin ( 1-7 ) . impaired ace2 activity results in excessive amounts of at2 , allowing for unopposed activation of at1r and subsequent development of acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) . fang and colleagues postulate that patients with sars-cov-2 treated with arbs and aceis are at a higher risk for severe covid-19 infection because of a potential upregulation of ace2 . however , preclinical models of sars-cov infection do not support this hypothesis . in 2005 , kuba and colleagues found that mice treated with losartan after acid aspiration-induced acute lung injury ( with addition of sars-cov spike protein ) had significantly diminished lung injury and pulmonary oedema compared with mice treated with placebo . furthermore , recombinant human ace2 infusions or losartan both prevented severe lung injury and pulmonary oedema in ace2-knockout mice . administration of recombinant human ace2 improved lung injury in patients with sars-cov infection and in acid aspiration and sepsis-induced models of ards . this premise supports the initiation of randomised controlled trials assessing recombinant human ace2 infusions and losartan in patients with covid-19 . severe ards secondary to impaired ace2 activity has been identified in other viral pneumonias ( eg , h5n1 and h7n9 influenza ) . treatment of mice after infection with h5n1 influenza with losartan versus placebo was associated with reduced pulmonary oedema , pulmonary neutrophil infiltration , and significantly improved survival . although controversy exists about the role of ras inhibition in covid-19 , no evidence is available to support routine discontinuation of aceis or arbs . preclinical evidence suggests that ras blockade might attenuate progression of covid-19 . we argue that clinical equipoise exists and , before the medical community makes recommendations for patients to withhold potentially life-saving drugs , there is a critical and urgent need for multicentre trials to test this hypothesis in patients with covid-19 . \n\n related links \n\n the latest guidance from who on ibuprofen and covid-19 ( dated : 19.03.2020 ) \n\n statement from prof michael roth on how to interpret the original letter \n\n references \n\n are patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus at increased risk for covid-19 infection ? \n\n elevated plasma angiotensin converting enzyme 2 activity is an independent predictor of major adverse cardiac events in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease \n\n angiotensin converting enzyme 2 activity and human atrial fibrillation : increased plasma angiotensin converting enzyme 2 activity is associated with atrial fibrillation and more advanced left atrial structural remodelling \n\n clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in wuhan , china \n\n angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for the sars coronavirus \n\n angiotensin receptor blockers as tentative sars-cov-2 therapeutics \n\n lessons from sars : control of acute lung failure by the sars receptor ace2 \n\n a crucial role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) in sars coronavirus-induced lung injury \n\n angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protects from severe acute lung failure \n\n angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protects from lethal avian influenza a h5n1 infections

00001000	safe delivery for covid-19 infected pregnancies . \n\n since december 2019 , a new coronavirus ( covid-19 ) infection has rapidly become prevalent in central china1 . on the basis of knowledge obtained from a previous coronavirus outbreak2 , pregnant women are believed to be susceptible to this virus . once a maternal infection of covid-19 is suspected or confirmed , childbirth becomes complicated and challenging . efficient obstetric treatment is required , and is key to optimizing the prognosis for both mother and child . care should be taken in determination of the timing of delivery , assessment of the indications for caesarean section , preparation of the delivery room to prevent infection , choice of the type of anesthesia , and newborn management .

00001000	covid-19 and hospitalizations for sari in brazil : a comparison up to the 12th epidemiological week of 2020 . \n\n surveillance of the severe acute respiratory illness ( sari ) in brazil aims to characterize the circulation of the influenza a and b viruses in hospitalized cases and deaths , having been expanded in 2012 to include other respiratory viruses . covid-19 was detected in brazil for the time in the 9th epidemiological week of 2020 , and the test for the sars-cov-2 virus was included in the surveillance protocol starting in the 12th epidemiological week . this study 's objective was to investigate the pattern of hospitalizations for sari in brazil since the entry of sars-cov-2 , comparing the temporal and age profiles and laboratory results to the years 2010 through 2019 . in 2020 , hospitalizations for sari , compiled from the date of the first confirmed case of covid-19 up to the 12th week , exceeded the numbers observed during the same period in each of the previous 10 years . the age bracket over 60 years was the most heavily affected , at higher than historical levels . there was a considerable increase in negative laboratory tests , suggesting circulation of a different virus from those already present in the panel . we concluded that the increase in hospitalizations for sari , the lack of specific information on the etiological agent , and the predominance of cases among the elderly during the same period in which there was an increase in the number of new cases of covid-19 are all consistent with the hypothesis that severe cases of covid-19 are already being detected by sari surveillance , placing an overload on the health system . the inclusion of testing for sars-cov-2 in the sari surveillance protocol and the test 's effective nationwide deployment are extremely important for monitoring the evolution of severe covid-19 cases in brazil .

00001000	living with a disability during the pandemic . `` instant paper from the field '' on rehabilitation answers to the covid-19 emergency . \n\n covid-19 pandemic is creating collateral damage to persons with disabling conditions of different aetiology . the restrictions imposed to contain the spread of infection is limiting the access to many health services , including rehabilitation . it is expected that such situation will lead to long lasting negative consequences for persons with disability , increasing functional limitations in chronic conditions and hindering the recovery after acute events . the aim of this paper is to explore the impact on people with disability , reporting the contents of the sixth italian society of physical and rehabilitation medicine ( simfer ) webinar on the covid-19 impact on rehabilitation ( `` covinars '' ) . seven representatives of associations of persons affected by different disabling conditions described the difficulties they are facing during the pandemic , the initiatives undertaken to support their members and their future perspectives and expectations . the users ' inputs will be helpful in planning the future phases of the emergency and improve preparedness for other emergencies . 
11001000	collateral damage of the covid-19 outbreak : expression of concern \n\n during the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) outbreak , several countries experienced the same phenomenon before being struck : a sudden calm , silence , few patients , quiet halls and less ambulances . then , when the wave of patients with severe covid began to strike , these usual emergency patients were still nowhere to be seen . in europe , as in north america , emergency departments noticed a major decrease of daily visits since the beginning of the outbreak and the implementation of public health measures . the spectacular decrease seems to be a uniform view shared on social media by emergency physicians all around europe and even overseas in quebec . while the population abided by the containment measures and hospitals closed most of their elective activities to cope with the anticipated surge in intensive care needs , emergency departments self-emptied . \n\n some patients may have opted for an alternative pathway for medical care while others may have forgone or postponed their urgent care . as colineaux et al . reported in a large sample of emergency department visits in france , 20 % of adult patients were considered severely ill and required emergency care while 62 % were intermediate cases who needed urgent care and technical resources . if some reasons for emergency department visits such as trauma have probably decreased due to the lockdown , there is no reason to think that the rate of stroke , myocardial infarction , appendicitis , or seizure have suddenly dropped during these peculiar weeks . based on electronic medical and administrative data systems of 22 hospitals of the eastern part of france , a region that has been struck early and with a high intensity of the covid wave , we report a decrease of 26 % of all emergency department visits , which comprises a decrease of : 34 % of strokes , 32 % of transitory ischemic attacks , 64 % of unstable angina , 42 % of appendicitis , and 36 % of seizures . in honk kong , tam et al . described the care management of a handful of patients with consecutive st-elevation myocardial infarction ( stemi ) after containment measures . when compared to 108 patients with stemi taken care of in 2019 , the authors report an increased delay between symptom onset and first medical contact in 2020 . authors raised concerns that patients may have been reluctant to consult in this particular context and rather postponed healthcare even though their life could be at stake . emergency physicians should definitely be worried about this collateral damage that the covid-19 outbreak is generating . other countries that faced serious infectious disease outbreaks such as ebola have reported major side effects , such as the diversion of needed care for other diseases and an increased mortality burden that was not attributed to ebola itself but rather to a stressed and overwhelmed healthcare system . thus , poor outcomes and unexpected consequences are to be reported beyond the perimeter of the outbreak . \n\n in the covid-19 context , there may be many reasons that explain why the usual emergency department patients seem to have disappeared despite the fact that all hospitals have managed to keep effective emergency pathways for non-covid patients . patients might have developed strategies different from the usual pathways and invested different healthcare resources such as teleconsultation or covid-free walk-in clinics standing away from usual pathways . these new approaches and trajectories should be analyzed as potential substitutes for part of the usual emergency visits . however , it is unlikely that all the usual emergency department patients have benefitted from those alternatives especially patients with severe illnesses and those requiring emergency settings . \n\n other suggestions are that patients might have fled emergency departments and waiting rooms because of the anxiety and fear of being infected by sars_cov2 through patients ' or providers ' proximity . they might have restrained themselves from looking for any medical advice since all efforts of the healthcare system and public health authorities seem focused on covid-19 management only . however , since unmet needs are associated with an increased risk of complications and worse outcomes , the quietness of our emergency departments should make us worry and should be considered as collateral damages that were not expected and anticipated during this outbreak and of the consequences of which will emerge in the coming weeks . \n\n that is why we urge emergency physicians and public health authorities to : \n\n enjoin all patients to seek urgent care when needed and to avoid any delays . this should be expressed loudly and clearly while the outbreak is still ongoing . patients need to be reassured and should know precisely that a specific covid-free pathway has been planned in each facility with dedicated resources in order to avoid nosocomial infections . \n\n engage in the assessment of all collateral damages that were not expected while organizing our departments to fight the outbreak . efforts should be focused on understanding the reasons that led or compelled non-covid patients to avoid or delay urgent care . this aspect of the crisis should not be neglected when the post-covid outbreak report will be formulated . \n\n find out and describe the new strategies that usual emergency department patients displayed during the outbreak in other settings away from the usual emergency pathways . \n\n in conclusion , we recommend that the huge efforts and research funding that are now focused on the improvement , management , and containment of the covid-19 outbreak do not avoid describing and analyzing the medical collateral damages that are still in the shadows but will spread when the outbreak subsides . \n\n acknowledgements \n\n the authors would

00001000	surgical considerations for an awake tracheotomy during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n background : the current global covid-19 pandemic is caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) . given that sars-cov-2 is highly transmissible , surgical societies have recommended that procedures with a high risk of aerosolization be avoided or delayed . however , some high-risk procedures , such as those related to head and neck malignancies , can not always be delayed . care must be taken during aerosol-generating procedures to minimize viral transmission as much as possible . preoperative testing for covid-19 , limited operating room personnel , adequate personal protective equipment , and surgical technique are factors to consider for high-risk procedures . methods : this article presents the case of an awake tracheotomy performed for a transglottic mass causing airway obstruction . results : with detailed planning and specific techniques , the amount of aerosolization was reduced , and the procedure was performed as safely as possible . conclusion : this case provides a template for future aerosol-generating procedures during respiratory pandemics . 
00001000	the burden of covid-19 in people living with hiv : a syndemic perspective . \n\n the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 creates another health burden for people living with hiv ( plwh ) who face multiple morbidities and may be at heightened risk for severe physical health illness from covid-19 . our abilities to address these morbidities in plwh must be considered alongside the socially-produced burdens that both place this population at risk for covid-19 and heighten the likelihood of adverse outcomes . these burdens can affect the physical , emotional , and social well-being of plwh and interfere with the delivery of effective healthcare and access to hiv treatment . we posit that a syndemic framework can be used to conceptualize the potential impact of covid-19 among plwh to inform the development of health programming services . 
10000000	molecular testing for acute respiratory tract infections : clinical and diagnostic recommendations from the idsa 's diagnostics committee . \n\n the clinical signs and symptoms of acute respiratory tract infections ( rtis ) are not pathogen specific . highly sensitive and specific nucleic acid amplification tests have become the diagnostic reference standard for viruses and translation of bacterial assays from basic research to routine clinical practice represents an exciting advance in respiratory medicine . most recently , molecular diagnostics have played an essential role in the global health response to the novel coronavirus pandemic . how best to use newer molecular tests for rti in combination with clinical judgment and traditional methods can be bewildering given the plethora of available assays and rapidly evolving technologies . here , we summarize the current state of the art with respect to the diagnosis of viral and bacterial rtis , provide a practical framework for diagnostic decision-making using selected patient-centered vignettes , and make recommendations for future studies to advance the field . 
00000100	sars-cov-2 detection in the pericardial fluid of a patient with cardiac tamponade \n\n to the editor \n\n severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 ( sars-cov-2 ) is a novel coronavirus first identified in wuhan , china , at the end of 2019 . since then it has caused more than 1,700,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) worldwide and almost 110,000 deaths . it is responsible for a respiratory syndrome ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to severe respiratory failure ( due to acute respiratory distress syndrome ) , shock , multiorgan failure and death .. sars-cov-2 has been first identified in a bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid collected from patients with pneumonia admitted in a hospital of wuhan on late december and a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( rrt-pcr ) of nasopharyngeal swabs is currently used to confirm the clinical diagnosis . from its isolation , sars-cov-2 has been detected in the respiratory tract , in feces , conjunctiva and in blood but its localization in other sites has not been reported so far . we reported here the first isolation of sars-cov-2 in the pericardial fluid of a patient affected with covid19 and cardiac tamponade undergoing pericardiocentesis . \n\n variable reference range february , 15 march , 11 march , 17 march , 23 march , 29 april , 5 hemoglobin ( g/dl ) 14-18 13 11.9 12.5 12.2 11.8 11.3 hematocrit ( % ) 42-50 40.6 36.5 38.7 39.4 38.3 35.6 platelet count ( per mm2 ) 150,000-400,000 150 106 202 460 324 215 white cell count ( per mm2 ) 4000-10000 5.8 1.9 5.6 8.5 4.7 5.2 absolute neutrophil count ( per mm2 ) 2000-7000 4.02 1.25 4.8 6.95 2.84 3.47 absolute lymphocyte count ( per mm2 ) 1500-4000 0.95 0.5 0.35 0.6 0.86 0.83 c-reactive protein ( mg/liter ) < 1 1.34 2.43 11 4.76 0.58 2.76 troponin i ( ng/l ) < 15 4580 < 15 < 15 22 20 d-dimer ( ng/ml ) < 400 1956 1966 4566 1607 fibrinogen ( mg/dl ) 150-350 775 631 sodium ( mmol/liter ) 135145 141 136 136 138 140 potassium ( mmol/liter ) 3,5-5 3.8 4.3 4.2 4.1 4.4 albumin ( g/dl ) 3.5-5.2 2.72 2.84 creatinine ( mg/dl ) 0.6-1.17 0.92 0.76 0.68 0.74 0.82 nt-probnp ( ng/l ) < 300 2705 glucose ( mg/dl ) 65-110 131 93 128 100 86 aspartate aminotransferase ( u/liter ) < 35 65 31 34 37 36 alanine aminotransferase ( u/liter ) < 45 27 25 65 53 68 lactate dehydrogenase ( u/liter ) 125-250 204 648 264 206 162 procalcitonin ( ng/ml ) < 0.49 0.10 0.11 \n\n laboratory results . \n\n table 1 : \n\n on february 15 , 2020 , a 59-year old man was admitted to our emergency department for acute chest pain . non-st elevation acute coronary syndrome was diagnosed with coronary angiography showing multivessel disease . the following day the patient underwent coronary artery bypass surgery with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , right internal mammary artery to first obtuse marginal and left radial artery to right coronary . he was extubated on the third day and echocardiography showed mild pericardial effusion without hemodynamic impairment . on march 5 , the patient complained of fever ; blood and urine culture were performed resulting negative . after three days , a new episode of fever associated with dyspnoea occurred ; considering the increasing number of cases affected with covid19 at our hospital , a nose-pharyngeal swab for sars-cov-2 research was performed with positive result ; at the same time serological tests for mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae , a/b influenza viruses research on respiratory specimens , urinary antigens for legionella pneumophila and streptococcus pneumoniae were performed and all resulted negative . patient underwent high-resolution lung ct scan showing `` ground glass '' areas with `` crazy paving '' pattern in both lungs , especially in the left lung , suggesting covid19-related interstitial pneumonia . therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine was started . blood samples trend showed increasing inflammatory markers ( c-reactive protein and fibrinogen ) , lactic dehydrogenase and d-dimer ( table 1 ) ; in the light of emerging evidence that suggested a role for low-molecular-weight-heparin ( lmwh ) to decrease mortality in covid19 patients with markedly elevated d-dimer , enoxaparin was also started . in the subsequent days , the patient was treated with helmet c-pap for hypoxic respiratory insufficiency with a favourable clinical response . on march 17 , we started antibiotic therapy with ampicillin and ceftriaxone because of a second blood culture showing the presence of enterococcus faecalis . after some days , global clinical conditions improved with progressive reduction in inflammatory markers ( table 1 ) . on march 31 , he complained of dyspnoea and chest pain : temperature was 36.5 c , blood pressure 100/65 mmhg , the pulse 130 beats per minute , the respiratory rate 24 beats per minute and the oxygen saturation 98 % while he was breathing room air . an echocardiography was performed and documented severe circumferential pericardial effusion conditioning collapse of the right heart sections . as shown in table 1 , high sensitivity troponin-i elevation was minimal . an echo-guided pericardiocentesis from subcostal approach was performed , draining 250 cc of sero-haemorragic fluid ; a sample was sent to our laboratory for physico-chemical , cytological , microbiological and molecular analysis . a second nasopharyngeal swab and a blood sample for viral rna detection were performed . pericardial drainage was maintained in situ for two days and a total of 400 cc of fluid was aspired . given the progressive improvement of clinical conditions and laboratory results , patient was discharged on april , 6 , in fiduciary isolation . \n\n pericardial fluid analysis \n\n chemical and cytological analysis of pericardial sample documented presence of inflammatory cells : erythrocyte , mononucleates elements and lymphocytes were predominant , neoplastic cells were not found . the presence of was detected by a rrt-pcr amplification of sars-cov-2 rna through the genefinder covid-19 plus realamp kit ( osang healthcare co , ltd. , korea ) on the elite ingenius platform ( elitech group , puteaux , france ) , which integrates extraction and amplification . the rrt-pcr kit detects in the same pcr reaction the presence of three sars-cov-2 targets : the envelope protein ( e ) , the nucleocapsid protein ( n ) and rna-dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) genes . an endogenous internal control based on the amplification of human beta-globin gene allows to confirm the quality of the sample material extracted and the execution of the test . the rrt-pcr analysis revealed the presence of sars-cov-2 n gene with a cycle threshold ( ct ) value of 37.07 ( the test is considered positive if ct < 43 ) . no amplification was detected for the other two sars-cov-2 genes , thus suggesting the presence of a low viral load ; the value of single positive target gene has already been postulated in a suggestive clinical context . our patient had a previous nasopharyngeal swab positive for all three target genes and a suggestive lung ct scan ; after about three weeks and a full course of antiviral therapy , the second nasopharyngeal swab and viral rna research in the blood were both negative : this data are in agreement with the bland positivity in the pericardial sample . in our opinion the absence of viral rna in blood and nasopharyngeal secretions and its presence in pericardial fluid could suggest a persistence site ; whether this has pathogenic implications is still unknown . \n\n covid-19 pathogenesis is still being characterized . until now , virus has been detected only in sites corresponding to clinical manifestations : respiratory , gastro-intestinal and ocular involvement are well known . however , although cardiac involvement has been described , pericardial and myocardial tropism of sars-cov-2 was only assumed . the present data provide a new piece in the complex puzzle of this emerging disease , suggesting a possible direct virus involvement in cardiologic manifestations . further studies in this direction are necessary . \n\n declaration of competing interest \n\n all authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper . \n\n references \n\n world heart organization . coronavirus disease ( covid-2019 ) situation reportshttps : //www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/ ) ] < /number > \n\n china medical treatment expert group for covid-19 . clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in china \n\n china novel coronavirus investigating and research team . a novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in china , 2019 \n\n clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in wuhan \n\n detection of sars-cov-2 in different types of clinical specimens \n\n characteristics of ocular findings of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in hubei province \n\n anticoagulation treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients with coagulopathy \n\n dynamic change process of target genes by rt-pcr testing of sars-cov-2 during the course of a coronavirus disease 2019 patient \n\n cardiac involvement in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) 
00011000	duration of quarantine in hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) infection : a question needing an answer \n\n in december 2019 a new form of pneumonia was observed in the chinese province of hubei . the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) was subsequently identified as responsible of this condition , defined coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) . the virus has now spread outside chinese borders with 82,297 cases and 2,804 deaths worldwide at the 26th of february . after infection , symptoms appear after an incubation time of 3-5 days , with 80 % of those infected developing a mild disease , 15 % a severe disease and 5 % will require support in intensive care unit ( icu ) . overall , the estimated case-fatality rate is comprised between 0.4 % and 2.9 % and the basic reproduction number is approximately 3.28 . sars-cov-2 is a new pathogen for humankind and any type of immune protection exist , thus everybody can be potentially infected . moreover , no primary prophylaxis measures ( vaccination ) nor effective treatments are available . if the above represented percentages are applied to the worldwide populations , it appears clear why any measure should be considered to avoid a further diffusion of the virus and prevent the saturation and collapse of health systems and the most catastrophic pandemic since 1919 spanish flu . \n\n isolation of those affected and the use of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are the mainstay to block transmission of this pathogen , which is presumed through respiratory droplets . a 14 days quarantine is applied to subjects coming from endemic areas or who had contact with confirmed cases . it is assumed that , if in this period the subject does not develop any sign or symptoms compatible with covid-19 , he is not infected and thus the quarantine can be removed , and the subject returned to the community . domiciliary quarantine of 14 days since a positive test is applied also for patients with a diagnosed mild disease who did not need medical support . \n\n these rules are effective in controlling infections in the community , but several doubts arise when it is necessary to transpose them in the hospital setting . hospitals are indeed a delicate place in epidemics : they collect fragile persons who can be exposed to the virus and are subsequently readmitted to the community thus spreading the infection . indeed , the ongoing outbreak in northern italy has been linked to a single infected patient who accessed to a community hospital where he transmitted the virus to several other patients and health-care operators . moreover , the isolation of patients in the hospital setting impose a significant burden in terms of ppe used by the health-care operators , space dedicated and time employed in their management . even more complex is the situation of patients in icu , where viral spreading is facilitated by endotracheal tubes and manoeuvres performed on the respiratory tract . therefore , a clear definition of the infectiousness timing and intensity of viral spreading is mandatory to alleviate the burden on the health-care system . \n\n unfortunately , the data available on the topic are scarce and composed only of measurements of viral shedding , without an assessment of the infectivity . kim et al . assessed the viral load kinetics of sars-cov-2 in upper and lower respiratory tract materials in the first two confirmed patients in korea . they employed real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( rrt-pcr ) to detect sars-cov-2 and converted cycle threshold ( ct ) values of rrt-pcr into rna copy number . the detection limit of rrt-pcr was 2,690 copies/ml . overall , viral load above detection limit was detected until 14 and 25 days after symptoms onset and for 13 and 11 days after the first detection , respectively . of note , both patients received treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir . instead , zou and colleagues analysed viral load in repeated nasal and throat swabs obtained from the 17 symptomatic patients . they also employed rrt-pcr and considered a ct of 40 as detection limit . higher viral loads were observed in nasal swabs and in samples collected soon after symptoms onset . overall , only two patients presented positive samples , and only in nasal swab , 14 days after symptoms onset , and with low viral load . \n\n in conclusion , a larger amount of data about duration of viral spreading and infectivity in hospitalized patients , especially in icu , is badly needed to better define quarantine period and avoid nosocomial transmission . before their availability , the canonical 14 days period of quarantine should be respected . \n\n financial

01000000	helmet cpap to treat acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in patients with covid-19 : a management strategy proposal . \n\n since the beginning of march 2020 , the coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) pandemic has caused more than 13,000 deaths in europe , almost 54 % of which has occurred in italy . the italian healthcare system is experiencing a stressful burden , especially in terms of intensive care assistance . in fact , the main clinical manifestation of covid-19 patients is represented by an acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to bilateral pulmonary infiltrates , that in many cases , results in an acute respiratory distress syndrome and requires an invasive ventilator support . a precocious respiratory support with non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen should be avoided to limit the droplets ' air-dispersion and the healthcare workers ' contamination . the application of a continuous positive airway pressure ( cpap ) by means of a helmet can represent an effective alternative to recruit diseased alveolar units and improve hypoxemia . it can also limit the room contamination , improve comfort for the patients , and allow for better clinical assistance with long-term tolerability . however , the initiation of a cpap is not free from pitfalls . it requires a careful titration and monitoring to avoid a delayed intubation . here , we discuss the rationale and some important considerations about timing , criteria , and monitoring requirements for patients with covid-19 respiratory failure requiring a cpap treatment .

00000100	two patients with acute meningo-encephalitis concomitant to sars-cov-2 infection . \n\n in december 2019 , a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause led to the identification of a new strain of pandemic coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) . since the first sars-cov outbreak , human coronaviruses are known for their neurological tropism . if respiratory complications are at the forefront of clinical presentation of sars-cov-2 , neurological involvement remains poorly described and understood . we report here two patients infected with sars-cov-2 who presented with neurological symptoms and signs . 
00100000	are pangolins the intermediate host of the 2019 novel coronavirus ( sars-cov-2 ) ? \n\n the outbreak of a novel corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in the city of wuhan , china has resulted in more than 1.7 million laboratory confirmed cases all over the world . recent studies showed that sars-cov-2 was likely originated from bats , but its intermediate hosts are still largely unknown . in this study , we assembled the complete genome of a coronavirus identified in 3 sick malayan pangolins . the molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that this pangolin coronavirus ( pangolin-cov-2020 ) is genetically related to the sars-cov-2 as well as a group of bat coronaviruses but do not support the sars-cov-2 emerged directly from the pangolin-cov-2020 . our study suggests that pangolins are natural hosts of betacoronaviruses . large surveillance of coronaviruses in pangolins could improve our understanding of the spectrum of coronaviruses in pangolins . in addition to conservation of wildlife , minimizing the exposures of humans to wildlife will be important to reduce the spillover risks of coronaviruses from wild animals to humans . 
00000100	the first case of covid-19 infection in a 75-day-old infant in jahrom city , south of iran \n\n various views of the hrct scan . \n\n figure 1 \n\n in late december of 2019 , a new coronavirus was discovered in china . on 11 february 2020 , the world health organization named the disease caused by this virus covid-19 . the disease quickly spread to chinese cities and other parts of the world , including thailand , japan , taiwan and iran . the number of infected patients increased daily until the world health organization in june declared the outbreak a serious and urgent threat to public health . most people infected with the virus recover well , but some also may experience fatal complications , such as acute organ failure , septic shock , acute pulmonary edema , acute pneumonia , and acute respiratory distress syndrome . as infection has been transmitted from individual to individual , the first cases of the disease in areas outside of wuhan , occurred in travelers from wuhan ; as the first case of covid-19 was confirmed to be a 35-year-old woman living in wuhan who traveled to korea . on january 20 , 2020 , a 55-year-old woman working in wuhan , arrived at taiwan and was referred to quarantine authorities with symptoms of sore throat , dry cough , fatigue , and feeling low-grade fever on january 11 . while covid-19 infection seems to be more prevalent in adults than in children , rare cases of children infection are being reported , mainly seen in family clusters . the presented case is a 75-day-old infant that was referred to the pediatric emergency department , with a history of severe dry cough and abnormal noisy breathing sound ( heard without a stethoscope ) during the last 11 days . the patient had been suffering from fever since about 7 days ago ; the fever was having a good response to antipyretic . but mother had not been using a thermometer for screening the fever . about three days ago coughs got more severe , along with an increased breathing sound and dyspnea appeared . on arrival , the infant had a respiratory rate of 50 per minute , a temperature of 37.6 centigrade , pulse rate of 172 and o2 saturation of 85 % . in physical examination , an intercostal retraction was seen and lung auscultation revealed diminished wheeze and ralse in both sides . after taking oxygen with the hood , the o2 saturation got increased to 97 % and intercostal retraction disappeared . therefore , respiratory rate reduced to 35 times per minute . a normal complete blood count and levels of na+ and k+ were reported upon the patient 's arrival . the high-resolution computed tomography ( hrct ) of the patient after two hours of patient arrival is shown in fig . 1 , which shows bilateral peripheral consolidation with a ground glass view . while , as reviewed in cao et al . study , most studies have reported the infection to be more severe in adults rather than the child , the dissemination of covid-19 in children implies that it has high transmitting potential in a specific transmission dynamics . pediatricians have to know more about the epidemiological and clinical aspects of the disease to diagnose and control covid-19 . \n\n declaration of competing interest \n\n the authors have no conflicts of interest relevant to this article . \n\n references \n\n world health organization declares global emergency : a review of the 2019 novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) \n\n incubation period of 2019 novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov ) infections among travelers from wuhan , china , 20-28 january 2020 \n\n the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia imported into korea from wuhan , china : implication for infection prevention and control measures \n\n first case of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) pneumonia in taiwan \n\n sars-cov-2 infection in children : transmission dynamics and clinical characteristics 
10001000	viral kinetics of sars-cov-2 in asymptomatic carriers and presymptomatic patients . \n\n from 71 laboratory-confirmed cases , we found three presymptomatic patients and 10 entirely asymptomatic infections . in two of the three incubation period patients , the viral titer in the presymptomatic period was very high ( ct value < 20 ) . the median days to first negative rt-pcr in the entirely asymptomatic carriers was 4.5 ( range 2.5-9 ) days and all asymptomatic carriers reached a first ct > 35 rt-pcr within 14 days after diagnosis . patients who have covid-19 may already be infectious before there are symptoms , and 14 days of isolation after diagnosis may be sufficient in entirely asymptomatic cases .

01100000	ace2 , covid-19 , and ace inhibitor and arb use during the pandemic : the pediatric perspective . \n\n potential but unconfirmed risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 in adults and children may include hypertension , cardiovascular disease , and chronic kidney disease , as well as the medications commonly prescribed for these conditions , angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor blockers . coronavirus binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 , a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system , underlies much of this concern . children are uniquely impacted by the coronavirus but the reasons are unclear . this review will highlight the relationship of coronavirus disease 2019 with hypertension , use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor blockers , and lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease from the pediatric perspective . we briefly summarize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and comprehensively review the literature pertaining to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin- ( 1-7 ) pathway in children and the clinical evidence for how angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor blockers affect this important pathway . given the importance of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin- ( 1-7 ) pathway and the potential differences between adults and children , it is crucial that children are included in coronavirus-related research , as this may shed light on potential mechanisms for why children are at decreased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 . 
01100000	preliminary identification of potential vaccine targets for the covid-19 coronavirus ( sars-cov-2 ) based on sars-cov immunological studies \n\n the beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of covid-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) . there is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread . in this study , we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against sars-cov-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov , which caused the outbreak in 2003 , and leveraging existing immunological studies of sars-cov . by screening the experimentally-determined sars-cov-derived b cell and t cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of sars-cov , we identified a set of b cell and t cell epitopes derived from the spike ( s ) and nucleocapsid ( n ) proteins that map identically to sars-cov-2 proteins . as no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the 120 available sars-cov-2 sequences ( as of 21 february 2020 ) , immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus . for the t cell epitopes , we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated mhc alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally , as well as in china . our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against sars-cov-2 . \n\n 1 . introduction \n\n the ongoing outbreak of covid-19 in the chinese city of wuhan ( hubei province ) and its alarmingly quick transmission to 25 other countries across the world resulted in the world health organization ( who ) declaring a global health emergency on 30 january 2020 . this came just one month after the first reported case on 31 december 2019. who , in its first emergency meeting , estimated the fatality rate of covid-19 to be around 4 % . worldwide collaborative efforts from scientists are underway to understand the novel and rapidly spreading virus that causes this disease , sars-cov-2 ( originally tentatively named 2019-ncov ) , and to develop effective interventions for controlling and preventing it . \n\n coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses belonging to the family coronaviridae . these viruses mostly infect animals , including birds and mammals . in humans , they generally cause mild respiratory infections , such as those observed in the common cold . however , some recent human coronavirus infections have resulted in lethal endemics , which include the sars ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) and mers ( middle east respiratory syndrome ) endemics . both of these are caused by zoonotic coronaviruses that belong to the genus betacoronavirus within coronaviridae . sars-cov originated from southern china and caused an endemic in 2003 . a total of 8098 cases of sars were reported globally , including 774 associated deaths , and an estimated case-fatality rate of 14 % -15 % . the first case of mers occurred in saudi arabia in 2012 . since then , a total of 2,494 cases of infection have been reported , including 858 associated deaths , and an estimated high case-fatality rate of 34.4 % . while no case of sars-cov infection has been reported since 2004 , mers-cov has been around since 2012 and has caused multiple sporadic outbreaks in different countries . \n\n like sars-cov and mers-cov , the recent sars-cov-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus . it has a genome size of ~30 kilobases which , like other coronaviruses , encodes for multiple structural and non-structural proteins . the structural proteins include the spike ( s ) protein , the envelope ( e ) protein , the membrane ( m ) protein , and the nucleocapsid ( n ) protein . with sars-cov-2 being discovered very recently , there is currently a lack of immunological information available about the virus ( e.g. , information about immunogenic epitopes eliciting antibody or t cell responses ) . preliminary studies suggest that sars-cov-2 is quite similar to sars-cov based on the full-length genome phylogenetic analysis , and the putatively similar cell entry mechanism and human cell receptor usage . due to this apparent similarity between the two viruses , previous research that has provided an understanding of protective immune responses against sars-cov may potentially be leveraged to aid vaccine development for sars-cov-2 . \n\n various reports related to sars-cov suggest a protective role of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses . for the former case , antibody responses generated against the s protein , the most exposed protein of sars-cov , have been shown to protect from infection in mouse models . in addition , multiple studies have shown that antibodies generated against the n protein of sars-cov , a highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed protein during infection , were particularly prevalent in sars-cov-infected patients . while being effective , the antibody response was found to be short-lived in convalescent sars-cov patients . in contrast , t cell responses have been shown to provide long-term protection , even up to 11 years post-infection , and thus have also attracted interest for a prospective vaccine against sars-cov [ reviewed in ] . among all sars-cov proteins , t cell responses against the structural proteins have been found to be the most immunogenic in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of convalescent sars-cov patients as compared to the non-structural proteins . further , of the structural proteins , t cell responses against the s and n proteins have been reported to be the most dominant and long-lasting . \n\n here , by analyzing available experimentally-determined sars-cov-derived b cell epitopes ( both linear and discontinuous ) and t cell epitopes , we identify and report those that are completely identical and comprise no mutation in the available sars-cov-2 sequences ( as of 21 february 2020 ) . these epitopes have the potential , therefore , to elicit a cross-reactive/effective response against sars-cov-2 . we focused particularly on the epitopes in the s and n structural proteins due to their dominant and long-lasting immune response previously reported against sars-cov . for the identified t cell epitopes , we additionally incorporated the information about the associated mhc alleles to provide a list of epitopes that seek to maximize population coverage globally , as well as in china . our presented results can potentially narrow down the search for potent targets for an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 , and help guide experimental studies focused on vaccine development . \n\n 2 . materials and methods \n\n 2.1 . acquisition and processing of sequence data \n\n a total of 120 whole genome sequences of sars-cov-2 were downloaded on 21 february 2020 from the gisaid database ( table s1 ) . we excluded sequences that likely had spurious mutations resulting from sequencing errors , as indicated in the comment field of the gisaid data . these nucleotide sequences were aligned to the genbank reference sequence ( accession id : nc_045512.2 ) and then translated into amino acid residues according to the coding sequence positions provided along the reference sequence for sars-cov-2 proteins ( orf1a , orf1b , s , orf3a , e , m , orf6 , orf7a , orf7b , orf8 , n , and orf10 ) . these sequences were aligned separately for each protein using the mafft multiple sequence alignment program . reference protein sequences for sars-cov and mers-cov were obtained following the same procedure from genbank using the accession ids nc_004718.3 and nc_019843.3 , respectively . \n\n 2.2 . acquisition and filtering of epitope data \n\n sars-cov-derived b cell and t cell epitopes were searched on the niaid virus pathogen database and analysis resource ( vipr ) ( ; accessed 21 february 2020 ) by querying for the virus species name : `` severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus '' from `` human '' hosts . we limited our search to include only the experimentally-determined epitopes that were associated with at least one positive assay : ( i ) positive b cell assays ( e.g. , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) -based qualitative binding ) for b cell epitopes ; and ( ii ) either positive t cell assays ( such as enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot ( elispot ) or intracellular cytokine staining ( ics ) ifn-gamma release ) , or positive major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) binding assays for t cell epitopes . strictly speaking , the latter set of epitopes , determined using positive mhc binding assays , are antigens which are candidate epitopes , since a t cell response has not been confirmed experimentally . however , for brevity and to be consistent with the terminology used in the vipr database , we will not make this qualification , and will simply refer to them as epitopes in this study . the number of b cell and t cell epitopes obtained from the database following the above procedure is listed in table 1 . \n\n 2.3 . population-coverage-based t cell epitope selection \n\n population coverages for sets of t cell epitopes were computed using the tool provided by the immune epitope database ( iedb ) ( ; accessed 21 february 2020 ) . this tool uses the distribution of mhc alleles ( with at least 4-digit resolution , e.g. , a * 02:01 ) within a defined population ( obtained from ) to estimate the population coverage for a set of t cell epitopes . the estimated population coverage represents the percentage of individuals within the population that are likely to elicit an immune response to at least one t cell epitope from the set . to identify the set of epitopes associated with mhc alleles that would maximize the population coverage , we adopted a greedy approach : ( i ) we first identified the mhc allele with the highest individual population coverage and initialized the set with their associated epitopes , then ( ii ) we progressively added epitopes associated with other mhc alleles that resulted in the largest increase of the accumulated population coverage . we stopped when no increase in the accumulated population coverage was observed by adding epitopes associated with any of the remaining mhc alleles . \n\n 2.4 . constructing the phylogenetic tree \n\n we used the publicly available software pasta v1.6.4 to construct a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of each structural protein using the unique set of sequences in the available data of sars-cov , mers-cov , and sars-cov-2 . we additionally included the zaria bat coronavirus strain ( accession id : hq166910.1 ) to serve as an outgroup . the appropriate parameters for tree estimation are automatically selected in the software based on the provided sequence data . for visualizing the constructed phylogenetic trees , we used the publicly available software dendroscope v3.6.3 . each constructed tree was rooted with the outgroup zaria bat coronavirus strain , and circular phylogram layout was used . \n\n 2.5 . data and code availability \n\n all sequence and immunological data , and all scripts ( written in r ) for reproducing the results are available online . \n\n 3 . results \n\n 3.1 . structural proteins of sars-cov-2 are genetically similar to sars-cov , but not to mers-cov \n\n sars-cov-2 has been observed to be close to sars-cov : much more so than mers-cov : based on full-length genome phylogenetic analysis . we checked whether this is also true at the level of the individual structural proteins ( s , e , m , and n ) . a straightforward reference-sequence-based comparison indeed confirmed this , showing that the m , n , and e proteins of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov have over 90 % genetic similarity , while that of the s protein was notably reduced ( but still high ) ( figure 1a ) . the similarity between sars-cov-2 and mers-cov , on the other hand , was substantially lower for all proteins ( figure 1a ) ; a feature that was also evident from the corresponding phylogenetic trees ( figure 1b ) . we note that while the former analysis ( figure 1a ) was based on the reference sequence of each coronavirus , it is indeed a good representative of the virus population , since few amino acid mutations have been observed in the corresponding sequence data ( figure s1 ) . it is also noteworthy that while mers-cov is the more recent coronavirus to have infected humans , and is comparatively more recurrent ( causing outbreaks in 2012 , 2015 , and 2018 ) , sars-cov-2 is closer to sars-cov , which has not been observed since 2004 . \n\n given the close genetic similarity between the structural proteins of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 , we attempted to leverage immunological studies of the structural proteins of sars-cov to potentially aid vaccine development for sars-cov-2 . we focused specifically on the s and n proteins as these are known to induce potent and long-lived immune responses in sars-cov . we used the available sars-cov-derived experimentally-determined epitope data ( see materials and methods ) and searched to identify t cell and b cell epitopes that were identical : and hence potentially cross-reactive : across sars-cov and sars-cov-2 . we first report the analysis for t cell epitopes , which have been shown to provide a long-lasting immune response against sars-cov , followed by a discussion of b cell epitopes . \n\n 3.2 . mapping the sars-cov-derived t cell epitopes that are identical in sars-cov-2 , and determining those with greatest estimated population coverage \n\n the sars-cov-derived t cell epitopes used in this study were experimentally-determined from two different types of assays : ( i ) positive t cell assays , which tested for a t cell response against epitopes , and ( ii ) positive mhc binding assays , which tested for epitope-mhc binding . we aligned these t cell epitopes across the sars-cov-2 protein sequences . among the 115 t cell epitopes that were determined by positive t cell assays ( table 1 ) , we found that 27 epitope-sequences were identical within sars-cov-2 proteins and comprised no mutation in the available sars-cov-2 sequences ( as of 21 february 2020 ) ( table 2 ) . interestingly , all of these were present in either the n ( 16 ) or s ( 11 ) protein . mhc binding assays were performed for 19 of these 27 epitopes , and these were reported to be associated with only five distinct mhc alleles ( at 4-digit resolution ) : hla-a * 02:01 , hla-b * 40:01 , hla-dra * 01:01 , hla-drb1 * 07:01 , and hla-drb1 * 04:01 . consequently , the accumulated population coverage of these epitopes ( see materials and methods for details ) is estimated to not be high for the global population ( 59.76 % ) , and was quite low for china ( 32.36 % ) . for the remaining 8 epitopes , since the associated mhc alleles are unknown , they could not be used in the population coverage computation . additional mhc binding tests to identify the mhc alleles that bind to these 8 epitopes may reveal additional distinct alleles , beyond the five determined so far , that may help to improve population coverage . \n\n to further expand the search and identify potentially effective t cell targets covering a higher percentage of the population , we next additionally considered the set of t cell epitopes that have been experimentally-determined from positive mhc binding assays ( table 1 ) , but , unlike the previous epitope set , their ability to induce a t cell response against sars-cov was not experimentally determined . nonetheless , they also present promising candidates for inducing a response against sars-cov-2 . for the expanded set of epitopes , all of which have at least one positive mhc binding assay , we found that 229 epitope-sequences have an identical match in sars-cov-2 proteins and have associated mhc allele information available ( listed in table s2 ) . of these 229 epitopes , ~82 % were mhc class i restricted epitopes ( table s3 ) . importantly , 102 of the 229 epitopes were derived from either the s ( 66 ) or n ( 36 ) protein . mapping all 66 s-derived epitopes onto the resolved crystal structure of the sars-cov s protein ( figure s2 ) revealed that 3 of these ( gyqpyrvvvl , qpyrvvvlsf , and pyrvvvlsf ) were located entirely in the sars-cov receptor-binding motif , known to be important for virus cell entry . \n\n similar to previous studies on hiv and hcv , we estimated population coverages for various combinations of mhc alleles associated with these 102 epitopes . our aim was to determine sets of epitopes associated with mhc alleles with maximum population coverage , potentially aiding the development of vaccines against sars-cov-2 . for selection , we adopted a greedy computational approach ( see materials and methods ) , which identified a set of t cell epitopes estimated to maximize global population coverage . this set comprised of multiple t cell epitopes associated with 20 distinct mhc alleles and was estimated to provide an accumulated population coverage of 96.29 % ( table 3 ) . interestingly , the majority of the t cell epitopes for which a positive immune response has been determined using t cell assays ( table 2 ) were presented by the globally most-prevalent mhc allele ( shown in blue color in table 3 ) . moreover , the functionally important epitopes located in the sars-cov receptor binding motif were associated with the second and third most-prevalent mhc alleles ( underlined in table 3 ) . thus , while the ordering of t cell epitopes in table 3 is based on the estimated global population coverage of the associated mhc alleles , it is also a natural order in which these epitopes should be tested experimentally for determining their potential to induce a positive immune response against sars-cov-2 . we also computed the population coverage of this specific set of epitopes in china , the country most affected by the covid-19 outbreak , which was estimated to be slightly lower ( 88.11 % ) , as certain mhc alleles ( e.g. , hla-a * 02:01 ) associated with some of these epitopes are less frequent in the chinese population ( table 3 ) . repeating the same greedy approach but focusing on the chinese population , instead of a global population , the maximum population coverage was estimated to be 92.76 % ( table s4 ) . \n\n due to the promiscuous nature of binding between peptides and mhc alleles , multiple s and n peptides were reported to bind to individual mhc alleles . thus , while we list all the s and n epitopes that bind to each mhc allele ( table 3 ) , the estimated maximum population coverage may be achieved by selecting at least one epitope for each listed mhc allele . likewise , many individual s and n epitopes were found to be presented by multiple alleles and thereby estimated to have varying global population coverage ( listed in table s5 ) . \n\n 3.3 . mapping the sars-cov-derived b cell epitopes that are identical in sars-cov-2 \n\n similar to t cell epitopes , we used in our study the sars-cov-derived b cell epitopes that have been experimentally-determined from positive b cell assays . these epitopes were classified as : ( i ) linear b cell epitopes ( antigenic peptides ) , and ( ii ) discontinuous b cell epitopes ( conformational epitopes with resolved structural determinants ) . \n\n we aligned the 298 linear b cell epitopes ( table 1 ) across the sars-cov-2 proteins and found that 49 epitope-sequences , all derived from structural proteins , have an identical match and comprised no mutation in the available sars-cov-2 protein sequences ( as of 21 february 2020 ) . interestingly , a large number ( 45 ) of these were derived from either the s ( 23 ) or n ( 22 ) protein ( table 4 ) , while the remaining ( 4 ) were from the m protein ( table s6 ) . \n\n on the other hand , all 6 sars-cov-derived discontinuous b cell epitopes obtained from the vipr database ( table 5 ) were derived from the s protein . based on the pairwise alignment between the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 reference sequences ( figure s3 ) , we found that none of these mapped identically to the sars-cov-2 s protein , in contrast to the linear epitopes . for 3 of these discontinuous b cell epitopes ( corresponding to antibodies s230 , m396 , and 80r ) , there was a partial mapping , with at least one site having an identical residue at the corresponding site in the sars-cov-2 s protein ( table 5 ) . \n\n mapping the residues of the linear and discontinuous b cell epitopes onto the available structure of the sars-cov s protein revealed their distinct association with the two functional subunits of the s protein : s1 , important for interaction with the host cell receptor , and s2 , involved in fusion of the cellular and virus membranes ( figure 2a ) . specifically , 20 of the 23 linear epitopes ( table 4 ) mapped to s2 ( figure 2b ) . thus , the antibodies targeting the identified linear epitopes in the s2 subunit might cross-react and neutralize both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 , as suggested in a very recent study . while s2 is comparatively less exposed than s1 , it may be accessible to antibodies during the complex conformational changes involved in viral entry of coronaviruses ; though this remains to be more clearly understood . in contrast , the 3 discontinuous b cell epitopes ( table 5 ) mapped onto the more exposed s1 subunit ( figure 2c , left panel ) , which contains the receptor-binding motif of the sars-cov s protein . we observed that very few residues of the 3 discontinuous epitopes were identical within sars-cov and sars-cov-2 ( figure 2c , right panel ) . these differences suggest that the sars-cov-specific antibodies s230 , m396 , and 80r known to bind to these epitopes in sars-cov might not be able to bind to the same regions in sars-cov-2 s protein . interestingly , while this paper was under review , this has been confirmed experimentally . further studies are currently under way to identify other sars-cov antibodies that may bind to discontinuous epitopes of the sars-cov-2 s protein . \n\n 4 . discussion \n\n the quest for a vaccine against the novel sars-cov-2 is recognized as an urgent problem . effective vaccination could indeed play a significant role in curbing the spread of the virus , and help to eliminate it from the human population . however , scientific efforts to address this challenge are only just beginning . much remains to be learnt about the virus , its biological properties , epidemiology , etc . at this early stage , there is also a lack of information about specific immune responses against sars-cov-2 , which presents a challenge for vaccine development . \n\n this study has sought to assist with the initial phase of vaccine development by providing recommendations of epitopes that may potentially be considered for incorporation in vaccine designs . despite having limited understanding of how the human immune system responds naturally to sars-cov-2 , these epitopes are motivated by responses they have recorded in sars-cov ( or , for the case of t cell epitopes , to at least confer mhc binding ) , and the fact that they map identically to sars-cov-2 , based on the available sequence data ( as of 21 february 2020 ) . this important observation should not be taken for granted . despite the apparent similarity between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 , there is still considerable genetic variation between the two , and it is not obvious a-prior if epitopes that elicit an immune response against sars-cov are likely to be effective against sars-cov-2 . we found that only 23 % and 16 % of known sars-cov t cell and b cell epitopes map identically to sars-cov-2 , respectively , and with no mutation having been observed in these epitopes among the available sars-cov-2 sequences ( as of 21 february 2020 ) . this provides a strong indication of their potential for eliciting a robust t cell or antibody response in sars-cov-2 . \n\n on the t cell side , the identification of sars-cov-derived epitopes that map identically to sars-cov-2 , and the large population that these are expected to cover , is particularly encouraging . it promotes further research in exploring vaccines designed to induce a protective t cell response , which has been shown to provide long term protection in sars-cov . on the b cell side , in agreement with very recent experimental studies , our results suggest that sars-cov-derived antibodies targeting the receptor binding motif in the s1 subunit of the sars-cov-2 s protein may not be effective , due to the large genetic mismatches observed in known structural epitopes targeting this domain . linear sars-cov-derived b cell epitopes in the s2 subunit may potentially be more promising candidates for inducing a protective antibody response . numerous of these epitopes , while being less exposed , are found to map identically to sars-cov and sars-cov-2 , and preliminary results are already emerging which suggest their potential in generating cross-reactive and neutralizing antibodies . hence , vaccine solutions that attempt to induce antibodies that target the s2 linear epitopes may be effective and should be explored further . \n\n research efforts directed towards the design and development of vaccines for sars-cov-2 are increasing , and some related analyses are already being reported in distinct , parallel studies . these studies , like our own , are based on leveraging available data and computational methods , and add to recent work focused on computational analysis and design of vaccines for various different viruses ( e.g. , . a preliminary analysis of linear sars-cov-derived b cell epitopes has been reported online on the vipr database website . different from our study , which is focused on the linear and discontinuous sars-cov-derived epitopes , that analysis considered linear b cell epitope data for all betacoronaviruses from human hosts . while only a summary of the results has been provided so far , preventing direct comparison of the individual epitopes , the number of linear b cell epitopes reported to map identically to sars-cov-2 is comparable to our findings . \n\n a recent study has also predicted t cell epitopes for sars-cov-2 that may be presented by a population from the asia-pacific region . again , there are multiple differences to our work . first , the focus of that study was on mhc class ii epitopes , while here we considered both mhc class i and ii epitopes . interestingly , while we found a few mhc class ii epitopes using our approach ( table s3 ) , only one of these ( hla-drb1 * 01:01 ) appeared in our identified epitope set ( table 3 ) , due to their comparatively low estimated population coverage . second , computational tools were used to predict mhc class ii epitopes in , while here we analyzed the sars-cov-derived epitopes that have been determined experimentally , using either positive t cell or mhc binding assays , and which match identically with the available sars-cov-2 sequences ( as of 21 february 2020 ) . thus , our identified epitopes are seemingly a more rational set of potential targets that can assist in the ongoing search for a sars-cov-2 vaccine . \n\n we acknowledge that this is a preliminary analysis based on the limited sequence data available for sars-cov-2 ( as of 21 february 2020 ) . as the virus continues to evolve and as more data is collected , it is expected that additional mutations will be observed . such mutations will not affect our analysis , provided that they occur outside of the identified epitope regions . if mutations do occur within epitope regions , then these epitopes may be further screened in line with the conservative filtering principle that we have employed , thereby producing a more refined epitope set . \n\n further experimental studies ( t cell and b cell assays ) are required to determine the potential of the identified epitopes to induce a positive immune response against sars-cov-2 . this would help to further refine the reported epitope set , based on observed immunogenicity ; an important consideration for immunogen design . \n\n overall , as the identified set of sars-cov epitopes map identically to sars-cov-2 , they present potentially useful candidates for guiding experimental efforts towards developing vaccines against sars-cov-2 . more generally , our study further highlights the potential importance of previous experimental and clinical studies of sars-cov , and its use in concert with emerging data for sars-cov-2 , in searching for effective vaccines to combat the covid-19 epidemic . \n\n supplementary materials \n\n the following are available online at , figure s1 : fraction of mutations in the

00000100	prolonged virus shedding even after seroconversion in a patient with covid-19 \n\n highlights \n\n prolonged virus shedding could be found among covid-19 patients after clinical symptoms resolved and specific antibody emerged . \n\n viral detection from throat gargling sample could be an alternative diagnostic method for mild covid-19 patients with scarce sputum . \n\n sputum remained the most sensitive specimen for viral detection after clinical symptoms resolved . \n\n dear editors , \n\n previous reports revealed that the emergence of the novel coronavirus ( sars-cov-2 ) infection ( covid-19 ) had raised global concern . several studies discussing the clinical pictures of covid-19 and specific antibody responding to sars-cov-2 have been published . however , the time sequences of clinical manifestations , virus shedding kinetics , contagiousness , and specific antibody reaction , which are essential for understanding pathophysiology and infection control strategy , have less been discussed . here we present a covid-19 patient with prolonged viral shedding and detailed time sequence of these parameters mentioned above . \n\n a 50-year-old woman , who suffered from acute-onset fever up to 38.6 c four hours ago , visited the emergency department of a medical center in taipei city , taiwan . she denied of cough or other subjective discomforts , and disclosed that she lived in wuhan , china and just traveled to taiwan two days prior to hospital visit . given the patient 's travel history , she was transferred to a negative-pressure isolation room for suspecting covid-19 . \n\n chest radiography was normal . hemogram revealed only mild thrombocytopenia ( 143 k/mul ) , while other blood tests were within normal limits . sputum and throat swab specimens yielded positive results for sars-cov-2 by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( rt-pcr ) . fever subsided rapidly after admission . however , elevated temperature up to 38.2 c was noted four days later . she did not have obvious respiratory symptoms and remained good spirit . all blood tests , except mildly elevated c-reactive protein ( crp ) ( 1.47 mg/dl ) and mild thrombocytopenia , were normal . a once-daily low-grade fever persisted until ninth day after symptom onset . the crp level reached to the peak on the tenth day after symptom onset and then normalized gradually . \n\n clinical specimens for sars-cov-2 testing were obtained in accordance with guidelines from the centers for disease control and prevention . during hospitalization , sputum and throat swab specimens were collected for sars-cov-2 rt-pcr and virus culture every other day . throat wash by gargling using 10 ml normal saline were collected when sputum specimens were not available . stool was collected for rt-pcr on the third , 14th and 20th day after symptom onset , and plasma was also sent within the first four days of hospitalization . \n\n plasmid dna containing the sars-cov-2 target sequences , including the envelope ( e ) , nucleocapsid ( n ) , and rna-dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) genes , was used to construct the standard curve to estimate the sars-cov-2 viral load by real-time rt-pcr . in addition , sars-cov-2 isolation was performed via vero e6 and llc-mk2 cell cultures . the full-length viral sequence was determined using sars-cov-2 amplified from the sputum specimen collected on the ninth day after symptom onset , and was submitted to the gisaid ( accession number is epi_isl_408489 ) . antibody response to sars-cov-2 viral n proteins was determined by western blotting using infected cell lysates . \n\n the sequential changes of sars-cov-2 viral load in throat swab , sputum , and gargling water are presented in figure . a drop of three logs of viral loads was observed among all specimens within one week after admission . however , sars-cov-2 persisted to be detectable till 63th day after symptom onset . among respiratory specimens from different sites , specimen from sputum showed superior sensitivity to samples from throat swab and gargling wash . initially , specimen from gargling wash showed considerable results compared with specimens from sputum or throat swab . nevertheless , rt-pcr examinations from sputum still outweighed samples from gargling and throat swab after fever subsided . among three target genes of the rt-pcr examinations , e gene of sars-cov-2 showed superior sensitivity to n and rdrp gene after clinical symptoms resolved . the stool specimen collected on the third day after symptom onset yielded positive results , but turned negative in the following specimens . the presence of sars-cov-2 could not be detected in the plasma samples while the sars-cov-2 titers in the respiratory specimen remained high . \n\n sars-cov-2 could be isolated from cell cultures in throat swab collected upon admission , and all sputum specimens collected within 18 days after symptoms onset . rt-pcr continued to detect virus till the 63th day after symptom onset regardless virus could only be isolated from respiratory specimens collected within the first 18 days . antibody to sars-cov-2 was firstly identified on the tenth day after symptom onset . in the meanwhile , no more fever above 37.5 c was noted , and crp began to decline . recovery of platelet count took place two days earlier than the emergence of sars-cov-2 antibody . \n\n this case demonstrated that the virus shedding might continue even after clinical resolution and seroconversion . in addition , although sars-cov-2 virus could not be isolated after the 18th day of symptom onset , the positive rt-pcr results continued for more than 60 days . because of the long interval between these two time points , it might be reasonable to infer that a small amount of viable virus , yet could not be detected by virus culture , remained present after the 18th day of disease course and last for more days . this implies the contagious period of covid-19 might last more than one week after `` clinical recovery '' . many of covid-19 patients in taiwan also had similar findings ( unpublished data ) . such prolonged virus shedding was also observed among asymptomatic pediatric patients in fecal specimen . however , this needs more studies to clarify since it would be a major issue in realizing and controlling the covid-19 epidemics . \n\n serial rt-pcr results in our case highlighted the importance of the clinical specimens sampled from lower respiratory tract for detecting sars-cov-2 virus , which is different from the report from zou l , et al . additionally , our case demonstrated that throat wash by gargling could be an alternative method for covid-19 diagnosis , since specimen from lower respiratory tract was barely available at the early stage of infection . nevertheless , when the patient became afebrile , sputum still outweighed specimens from throat swab or gargling wash . \n\n our case highlighted the prolonged virus shedding course of covid-19 even after the clinical symptoms resolved and seroconversion developed . it implies the possibility of a prolonged contagious period and should be investigated further to better control the epidemics . our study also demonstrated viral detection from throat gargling sample could be an alternative diagnostic method for patients without sputum . \n\n profile of viral load and antibody response to sars-cov-2 in the case patient . ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) sequential changes of sars-cov-2 viral load in the throat swab , sputum , and throat wash by gargling . the sars-cov-2 viral load was determined using the protocol provided by the who ( https : //virologie-ccm.charite.de/en ) . plasmids containing partial e , n , and rdrp fragments were used respectively as the standards to calculate the amount of sars-cov-2 viral load in the specimens .

00000100	covid-19 in a ms patient treated with ocrelizumab : does immunosuppression have a protective role ? \n\n highlights \n\n a ms patient treated with ocrelizumab healed from covid-19 without consequences \n\n immunosuppression might have played favorable role \n\n this report supports the use of immunosuppressants in serious covid-19 c \n\n background \n\n coronavirus disease 19 ( covid-19 ) is a novel disease entity that is spreading throughout the world . it has been speculated that patients with comorbidities and elderly patients could be at high risk for respiratory insufficiency and death . immunosuppression could expose infected patients to even higher risks of disease complications due to dampened immune response . however , it has been speculated that overactive immune response could drive clinical deterioration and , based on this hypothesis , several immunosuppressants are currently being tested as potential treatment for covid-19 . \n\n methods \n\n in this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with ocrelizumab ( a b-cell depleting monoclonal antibody ) for primary progressive multiple sclerosis who developed covid-19 . \n\n results \n\n despite complete b cell depletion , patient symptoms abated few days after hospitalization , and he was discharged to home-quarantine . phone interview follow-up confirmed that , after 14 days , no new symptoms occurred . \n\n discussion \n\n this report supports the putative role of immunosuppressive therapy in covid-19 affected patients . \n\n main text \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) is a novel disease entity caused by sars-cov-2 that recently spread throughout europe . the disease appears to be mild in the majority of patients , however , a subset ( about 15 % ) of affected individuals can develop a severe disease with respiratory insufficiency , that may require non-invasive or invasive ventilation and intensive care . elderly individuals and patients with co-morbidities are at higher risk of developing a severe or fatal phenotype of the disease . immunosuppressed patients might be more susceptible to covid-19 complications due to the absence of a prompt immunological response able to clear the virus . however , it has been suggested that immunosuppression might play a protective role during covid-19 infection by preventing or dampening the overly active immune response that , in some cases , might drive clinical deterioration . \n\n we report a case of covid-19 in a patient with multiple sclerosis ( ms ) treated with ocrelizumab ( humanized anti-cd20 monoclonal antibody ) . \n\n he is a 58-year old withe male who developed progressive lower limbs motor impairment in 2008 and was diagnosed with primary progressive ms ( ppms ) in 2009 . he was previously treated with interferon beta-1a , glatiramer acetate , and fingolimod . his past medical history includes allergic rhinitis , asthma and peptic ulcer . in january 2018 treatment with ocrelizumab was started within the compassionate use program for ppms . he also started lamivudine prophylaxis due to the presence of positive hbv anti-core antibody . periodic 6-month ocrelizumab infusions were performed until august 2019 ( a reinfusion was planned in february 2020 but was delayed due to patient convenience and rescheduled in march 2020 ) . at the time of the last infusion patient had moderate hypogammaglobulinemia ( igg 6.5 g/l , reference range 8-17 g/l ) with normal igm and iga levels , and peripheral blood lymphocyte immunophenotype showed profound b-cell depletion ( 8 cd19+ cell/mm3 ) . expanded disability status scale was 6 ( patient was able to ambulate with a cane ) . \n\n on march 6th 2020 patient developed fever and cough , he was admitted to our hospital on march the 10th due to persistent high fever and severe cough . blood exam showed normal leucocyte and lymphocyte count ( 7.79x10^9 cells/l , range 4.90-9.80 and 1.50x10^9 cells/l , range 1.10-4.80 , respectively ) , with elevated c-reactive protein ( 63.1 mg/l , range 0-5 ) , slight increase of interleuchin-6 ( il-6 ) levels ( 6 pg/ml , range 0-3.4 ) , and moderate igg hypogammaglobulinemia ( 6.5 g/l ) . chest x-ray was unremarkable . pcr for sars-cov-2 was performed on nasal swab and tested positive on two samples . arterial blood gas test showed normal blood oxygenation . patient was treated with symptomatic therapy for high fever ( paracetamol ) , with resolution of symptoms in two days . he was discharged to home-quarantine on march the 13th with normal leukocyte and lymphocyte count ( 5.13x10^9/l cell/l and 1.63x10^9/l ) and reduced c reactive protein levels ( 16.4 mg/l ) . peripheral blood lymphocyte immunophenotype , performed upon admission , confirmed a complete b-cell depletion ( 1 cd19+ cell/mm3 ) , as expected by ocrelizumab drug pharmacodynamic . phone interview , performed on march the 28th , confirmed that patient is still home-quarantined , without occurrence of any new symptoms . \n\n in this report we describe the first case of a b cells depleted patients that developed covid-19 , without serious complications . we speculate that the persistence of b cells within secondary lymphoid organs , associated with a moderately reduced immune response due to lack of peripheral b cells might have played a favorable role in this patient . the lack of significant increase of il-6 ( that might be released by the peripheral b cells ) seems to support our hypothesis . if confirmed by larger case series , our observation might indicate that patients who undergo b cell depletion could be protected from serious complications of covid-19 and might support the use of selective immunosuppressant such as tocilizumab in serious covid-19 cases . \n\n conflicts of interest \n\n giovanni novi received speaker honoraria from merck , novartis and roche \n\n malgorzata mikulska received speaker honoraria from msd , gilead

00010000	is there evidence of intra-uterine vertical transmission potential of covid-19 infection in samples tested by quantitative rt-pcr ? \n\n dear editor , \n\n the covid-19 pneumonia was first reported in wuhan , hubei province in china in late december 2019 . the disease has since quickly spread worldwide , and has been declared a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) by the world health organization ( who ) . according to current evidence , covid-19 is mainly transmitted with close contact through respiratory droplets ( such as coughing ) and by fomites . pregnancy presents a unique immunological situation , characterized by increased susceptibility to some infectious diseases , including respiratory pathogens . pregnant women could hence be at higher risk of severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) infection compared to the general population . in previous pandemics such as h1n1 , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) and middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) , pregnant women seemed to have poor clinical and obstetric outcomes and higher mortality compared to non-pregnant women . nonetheless , the even limited data available on covid-19 in pregnant women would suggest that these patients have similar clinical course as non-pregnant women , despite concerns for possibility of increased risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight . the potential of vertical mother-to-child transmission of covid-19 infection is also still unclear . we therefore analyzed current literature to identify any evidence of vertical transmission . \n\n a systematic electronic search was carried out in medline ( pubmed interface ) and china national knowledge infrastructure ( cnki ) using the keywords `` vertical transmission '' or `` maternal to fetal transmission '' or `` pregnancy outcomes '' and `` coronavirus 2019 '' or `` 2019-ncov '' or `` sars-cov-2 '' , between 2019 and present time ( i.e.,11th april , 2020 ) , without applying language restrictions . the title , abstract and full text of all documents identified with these search criteria were assessed to identify studies reporting information vertical transmission of covid-19 . the reference lists of all documents were also analyzed to identify any additional eligible studies . intra-uterine vertical transmission was defined as positive identification of sars-cov-2 in placenta , amniotic fluid , cord blood or neonatal pharyngeal/ throat swabs through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( rt-pcr ) taken immediately after birth . \n\n the initial search produced 40 potentially relevant articles . following primary screening and assessment by full text for eligibility in the meta-analysis , 35 articles were excluded since they were review articles ( n = 11 ) , commentaries or other editorial materials ( n = 8 ) , or did not contain data on vertical transmission of covid-19 patients ( n = 16 ) . \n\n author region no . of patients tested for vertical transmission gestational age at onset of symptoms/ diagnosis of covid-19 mode of delivery specimens tested number of positive tests lei et al . china 4 women ;

1 neonate 3rd trimester ( 33 weeks ) vaginal delivery amniotic fluid , neonatal throat swab 0 \n\n characteristics of the studies included in the analysis . \n\n table 1 \n\n overall , 5 studies ( n = 16 pregnant covid-19 patients ) were included in the final analysis . all studies were from china . in all women , the onset of symptoms and subsequent diagnosis with covid-19 was late in pregnancy ( 3rd trimester ) . all but one delivered via caesarian section . none of the specimens tested positive for sars-cov-2 ( table 1 ) . these findings therefore suggest that there is there is currently no evidence of intra-uterine vertical mother to child transmission of sars-cov-2 in samples tested by rt-pcr method . \n\n that being said , there are reports on neonatal covid-19 infections whose mode of transmission is still unclear . for instance , yu et al. , in their retrospective analysis of pregnancy outcomes in covid-19 patients reported one neonate who tested positive for covid-19 36 h after delivery . nucleic tests of placenta and cord blood were negative for sars-cov-2 , thus indicating the unlikely possibility of vertical transmission . similarly , dong et al. , reported a case of `` possible vertical transmission of sars-cov-2 '' based on elevated sars-cov-2 specific antibodies ( igg and igm ) in neonatal serum samples taken 2 h after delivery . since igm can not cross the placenta , the possibility of intra-uterine transmission can not be completely ruled out . five rt-pcr tests on neonatal nasopharyngeal swabs taken from 2 h to 16 days of age were however negative . importantly , an optimal covid-19 testing method for neonates has yet to be established . \n\n in conclusion , there is currently no definitive evidence of intra-uterine vertical transmission of covid-19 in pregnant women diagnosed in the third trimester . all patients included in the current analysis developed symptoms and were diagnosed with covid-19 late in pregnancy ( 3rd trimester ) . the potential of intra-uterine vertical covid-19 transmission in the first and second trimester is still unknown . high quality studies are urgently needed to further investigate vertical transmission and risks of severe covid-19 infections in pregnant women . \n\n funding \n\n no funding was sort for this study . \n\n declaration of competing interest \n\n none of the authors have any conflicts of interests with regard to this publication . \n\n references \n\n statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations- ( 2005 ) -emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus \n\n the epidemiology and pathogenesis of coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) outbreak \n\n why are pregnant women susceptible to viral infection : an immunological viewpoint ? \n\n impact of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) on pregnancy and perinatal outcome \n\n clinical characteristics and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of covid-19 infection in nine pregnant women : a retrospective review of medical records \n\n clinical analysis of 10 neonates born to mothers with 2019-ncov pneumonia \n\n clinical analysis of 9 cases of pregnancy with new coronavirus pneumonia [ j / ol ] \n\n clinical characteristics and pathological analysis of placenta in three cases of pregnant women with novel coronavirus infection [ j / ol ] \n\n perinatal transmission of covid-19 associated sars-cov-2 : should we worry ? \n\n vaginal delivery report of a healthy neonate born to a convalescent mother with covid19 \n\n clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with covid-19 in wuhan , china : a retrospective , single-centre , descriptive study \n\n possible vertical transmission of sars-cov-2 from an infected mother to her newborn 
00000100	covid-19 pneumonia in a kidney transplant recipient successfully treated with tocilizumab and hydroxychloroquine . \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) pneumonia has been poorly reported in solid-organ transplanted patients ; prognosis is uncertain and best management unclear . we describe the case of a 61-year-old kidney transplant recipient with several co-morbidities who was hospitalized and later received a diagnosis of covid-19 pneumonia ; the infection was successfully managed with the use of hydroxychloroquine and a single administration of tocilizumab , after immunosuppression reduction ; the patient did not require mechanical ventilation . during the rapid spread of sars-cov-2 pandemic , transplant clinicians should be readily informed about new cases of covid-19 pneumonia in solid-organ transplant recipients , with focus on therapeutic strategies employed and their outcome . 
00001000	lessons learned during the covid-19 virus pandemic \n\n covid-19 is a new strain of coronavirus identified in china . cases have now been detected in almost all countries in asia , australia , europe , and north america . as of march 16 , 2020 , laboratories in italy have diagnosed more than 27,000 people affected by the disease , with 2,158 deaths . many infected patients do not have symptoms , so it is difficult to estimate the case fatality rate . in patients hospitalized for severe symptoms , the case fatality rate is around 15 % . elderly patients with severe comorbidities are at higher risk for mortality . children and young adults rarely have symptoms , but they can carry the virus . \n\n at this writing , italy , for unknown reasons , has the highest prevalence of the disease , with mortality rates higher than in china and south korea , probably related to the advanced mean age of the italian population . so far , there has been a close correlation between regions with worse air pollution and diffusion of the virus in italy . italy has imposed severe restrictions to avoid diffusion of the virus . at the beginning , some inevitable organizational problems were encountered , which i would like to underline in this difficult moment , when the problems seem to be worsening in other countries . \n\n need for icu beds \n\n it is difficult to determine the percentage of contaminated patients , symptomatic or not , who will require hospitalization and intensive care . ventilatory assistance is required in about 10 % of the hospitalized patients , and the mortality rate in patients requiring ventilator assistance , younger than 75 years of age , without major comorbidity , is minimal . so , it is difficult to determine the number of icu beds needed , but no country in the world , so far , has had enough icu beds . this has been , and is , a major problem for northern italy . \n\n need for icu doctors and nurses \n\n in italy , doctors and nurses have done an extraordinary job , working more than 100 hours per week . there has been , and there is , a shortage of doctors and nurses . in italy , many doctors and nurses were contaminated so they had to stop working . again , it is difficult to determine the real prevalence of doctors and nurses who were contaminated . covid-19 diagnosis should be performed in all nurses and doctors , because the disease often does not manifest in people younger than 35 years of age , and doctors and nurses can carry the disease all over the hospital . \n\n need for hospital devoted only to covid-19 patients \n\n the most common initial attitude in all countries has been an under-evaluation of the contamination rate . often covid-19 patients have been admitted through the emergency room to common wards , before a diagnosis was made , and they were isolated . in this period , the possibility of a diffuse contamination of the hospital workers is highly probable . the best solution is to have hospitals devoted only to covid-19 patients , and to have emergency rooms in which patients with suspected covid-19 infection are evaluated . \n\n importance of avoiding medical facilities \n\n too many medical facilities have been contaminated from the beginning , when patients with respiratory symptoms asked for advice . the best solution is to have dedicated and experienced people who , through e-mail and video conference , follow the patient . if symptoms get worse , then the patient can be taken by ambulance to the specialized emergency room , for complete evaluation . an initial shortage of masks , gloves , and other materials is inevitable . \n\n telephone follow-up \n\n many surgical patients are seen in outpatient clinic . surgeons should be prepared to create a video conference network to follow their patients or to see new patients . \n\n these are few of the main preventable problems i have seen in italy . in this difficult situation , indications for surgery should be changed . operations which can be deferred should be not performed , and the patient should not be admitted or seen in medical facilities . \n\n references \n\n coronavirus infections-more than just the common cold \n\n a novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern \n\n a familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission : a study of a family cluster \n\n clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in wuhan , china \n\n data sharing and outbreaks : best practice exemplified \n\n emerging understandings of 2019-ncov \n\n epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in wuhan , china : a descriptive study \n\n genomic characterization and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus : implications for virus origins and receptor binding \n\n disclosure information : nothing to disclose . 
10000000	point-of-care lung ultrasound findings in patients with novel coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) pneumonia . \n\n patients with novel coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) typically present with bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification with a peripheral distribution . the utility of point-of-care ultrasound has been suggested , but detailed descriptions of lung ultrasound findings are not available . we evaluated lung ultrasound findings in 10 patients admitted to the internal medicine ward with covid-19 . all of the patients had characteristic glass rockets with or without the birolleau variant ( white lung ) . thick irregular pleural lines and confluent b lines were also present in all of the patients . five of the 10 patients had small subpleural consolidations . point-of-care lung ultrasound has multiple advantages , including lack of radiation exposure and repeatability . also , lung ultrasound has been shown to be more sensitive than a chest radiograph in detecting alveolar-interstitial syndrome . the utilization of lung ultrasound may also reduce exposure of healthcare workers to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 and may mitigate the shortage of personal protective equipment . further studies are needed to evaluate the utility of lung ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of covid-19 . 
11001000	coronavirus disease 2019 in children : surprising findings in the midst of a global pandemic . \n\n question coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) is affecting millions of people worldwide . it seems that it affects mostly adults older than 40 years of age , and the death rate is highest for older individuals in the population . what should i tell parents worried about their children contracting the coronavirus ( sars-cov-2 ) causing covid-19 , and what symptoms should i look for to determine if there is a need to test for the virus ? answer the covid-19 global pandemic affects all ages . severe respiratory manifestations have been the mainstay of illness in adults , with what seems to be rapid deterioration necessitating mechanical ventilation . only 5 % of those tested and found to have covid-19 have been younger than 19 years , possibly owing to limited testing , as the symptoms in children are usually mild . symptoms in children include fever , dry cough , rhinorrhea , sore throat , and fatigue , and in 10 % diarrhea or vomiting . rarely dyspnea or hypoxemia were also described . blood tests and imaging have been shown to be of little value in children and should only be ordered for those in whom you would normally order these investigations for viral-like illness . no specific therapy is available and supportive care with rest , fluids , and antipyretics for children is the recommended approach . ibuprofen or acetaminophen for fever and pain can be given . antiviral and immunomodulatory treatment is not recommended at this time for otherwise healthy children , and corticosteroids should also not be used . children with immunocompromised states should be isolated and avoid contact with others . 
00001000	practical guidance for managing emg requests and testing during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n the covid-19 pandemic has necessitated cancelation of elective or non-urgent contact with the healthcare system , including non-urgent nerve conduction studies and electromyography ( electrodiagnostic [ edx ] studies ) . the definitions of elective and non-urgent are physician judgments , and often are not straightforward . clinical care must be provided to help our patients in a timely manner , while keeping them , health care personnel and the community safe . benefit/risk stratification is an important part of this process . we have stratified edx studies into 3 categories : urgent , non-urgent and possibly urgent , in an effort to help clinicians triage these referrals . for each category , we provide a rationale and some examples . however , each referral must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis , and the clinical situation will evolve over time , necessitating flexibility in managing edx triaging . engaging the referring clinician and , at times , the patient , may be useful in the triage process . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved . 
10000000	analysis of coagulation parameters in patients with covid-19 in shanghai , china . \n\n to investigate the characteristic of coagulation function in 303 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , we evaluated the correlation between coagulation function and disease status . we retrospectively analyzed 303 patients diagnosed with covid-19 and evaluated the clinical data of 240 patients who were discharged . the coagulation function of the two groups ( mild and severe ) was compared . compared with the mild group , majority of patients in the severe group were male ( 76.9 % vs. 49.8 % ) and elderly ( median age 65 vs. 50 ) , and the proportion with chronic underlying diseases was higher ( 73.1 % vs. 36.1 % ) . there were 209 abnormalities ( 69.0 % ) of coagulation parameters in 303 patients admitted to hospital . comparison of various indexes of coagulation function between the two groups in admission , the proportion of abnormal coagulation indicators in the severe group was higher than that in the mild group ( 100 % vs. 66.1 % ) . the median coagulation parameters in the severe group were higher than those in the mild group : international normalized ratio ( 1.04 vs. 1.01 ) , prothrombin time ( 13.8 vs. 13.4 ) seconds , activated partial thromboplastin time ( 43.2 vs. 39.2 ) seconds , fibrinogen ( 4.74 vs. 4.33 ) g/l , fibrinogen degradation products ( 2.61 vs. 0.99 ) microg/ml , and d-dimer ( 1.04 vs. 0.43 ) microg/ml , the differences were statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) . coagulation dysfunction is common in patients with covid-19 , especially fibrinogen and d-dimer elevation , and the degree of elevation is related to the severity of the disease . as the disease recovers , fibrinogen and activated partial thromboplastin time also return to normal . 
11000000	suppressed t cell-mediated immunity in patients with covid-19 : a clinical retrospective study in wuhan , china \n\n importance \n\n an ongoing outbreak of covid-19 has exhibited significant threats around the world . we found a significant decrease of t lymphocyte subsets and an increase of inflammatory cytokines of hospitalized patients with covid-19 in clinical practice . \n\n methods \n\n we conducted a retrospective , single-center observational study of in-hospital adult patients with confirmed covid-19 in hubei provincial hospital of traditional chinese and western medicine ( wuhan , china ) by mar 1 , 2020 . demographic , clinical , laboratory information , especially t lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines were reported . for patients who died or discharge from hospital , the associations of t lymphocyte subsets on admission were evaluated by univariate logistic regression with odds ratios ( ors ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) , warning values to predict in-hospital death were assessed by receiver operator characteristic ( roc ) curves . \n\n results \n\n a total of 187 patients were enrolled in our study from dec 26 , 2019 to mar 1 , 2020 , of whom 145 were survivors ( discharge= 117 ) or non-survivors ( in-hospital death=28 ) . all patients exhibited a significant drop of t lymphocyte subsets counts with remarkably increasing concentrations of saa , crp , il-6 , and il-10 compared to normal values . the median concentrations of saa and crp in critically-ill patients were nearly 4- and 10-fold than those of mild-ill patients , respectively . as the severity of covid-19 getting worse , the counts of t lymphocyte drop lower.28 patients died in hospital , the median lymphocyte , cd3+ t-cell , cd4+ t-cell , cd8+ t-cell and b-cell were significantly lower than other patients . lower counts ( /ul ) of t lymphocyte subsets lymphocyte ( < 500 ) , cd3+t-cell ( < 200 ) , cd4+ t-cell ( < 100 ) , cd8+ t-cell ( < 100 ) and b-cell ( < 50 ) were associated with higher risks of in-hospital death of civid-19 . the warning values to predict in-hospital death of lymphocyte , cd3+ t-cell , cd4+ t-cell , cd8+ t-cell , and b-cell were 559 , 235 , 104 , 85 and 82 , respectively . \n\n conclusion \n\n we find a significant decrease of t lymphocyte subset is positively correlated with in-hospital death and severity of illness . the decreased levels of t lymphocyte subsets reported in our study were similar with sars but not common among other virus infection , which may be possible biomarkers for early diagnosis of covid-19 . our findings may shed light on early warning of high risks of mortality and help early intervention and treatment of covid-19 . \n\n introduction \n\n an ongoing outbreak of novel coronavirus disease covid-19 has exhibited significant threats to international health and economy . covid-19 caused by the virus sars-cov-2 . the most likely ecological reservoirs for sars-cov-2 are bats , but it is believed that the virus transmitted from animal to human by some intermediated animal host . in china , the first case of covid-19 was reported in wuhan , hubei province at dec,2019 . the first series of patients in wuhan with conformed covid-19 worked or lived around the local huanan seafood wholesale market , selling wild animals as well . shortly after that , infected patients exploded without contact history of the market . the number of covid-19 globally were 76769 till feb 21 , 2020 , including 75569 patients in china . unfortunately , no target treatment for this virus has been proved until now . we can not totally know of this virus and its related diseases covid-19 . therefore , this severe infectious disease garnered great research interest . previous clinical studies revealed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of infected patients of special population or series cases . they focused on general clinical characteristics and laboratory results of patients with confirmed covid-19 . meanwhile , several studies reported the damaged immunity system caused by sars-cov-2 and a significant decrease of lymphocyte in blood routine examination . but no research focused on the t lymphocyte subsets in covid-19 . in a general way , immune system is the first to be affected with virus infection . it has been confirmed that coronavirus infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory ( sars ) and middle east respiratory syndromes ( mers ) play important roles in immunity system injury . the t-cell and b-cell immunity may predict the disease severe level of coronavirus infection as well as the clinical outcomes . t lymphocyte plays a vital role in cell-mediated and humoral immunity . t lymphocyte includes cd3+ t cells , cd4+ t cells ( helper t cells ) and cd8+ t cells ( cytotoxic t cells , or killer t cells ) , natural killer ( nk ) cells and b cells , which can only recognize protein-based receptor-bound antigens . from dec 26 , 2019 to now , we included over hundreds of patients with conformed covid-19 . we are one of the hospitals which primary diagnosed and treated covid-19 patients and reported this new infectious disease to chinese center for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) at first . in clinical practice , we find that most patients showed significant changes of t lymphocyte subset and several inflammatory cytokines . therefore , we are interested in the relationship between t lymphocyte subset and in-hospital death and severity of illness among hospitalized patients with covid-19 . in this study , we focus on the suppressed t lymphocyte subsets and increased inflammatory cytokines . furthermore , we measured the association of t lymphocyte subsets and in-hospital death as well as the severity of covid-19 . \n\n methods \n\n study design and participants \n\n for this retrospective , single-center observational study , we included patients from dec 26 , 2019 to mar 1,2020 at hubei provincial hospital of traditional chinese and western medicine , wuhan , china . our hospital located closely to the huanan seafood wholesale market . our hospital is the first institution reported the new infectious disease to chinese center for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) . a continuous series of patients who were diagnosed as confirmed covid-19 . \n\n this study was reviewed and approved by the medical ethical committee of hubei provincial hospital of traditional chinese and western medicine ( no.2020013 ) . written informed consent was obtained from every enrolled patient . \n\n data collection \n\n we reviewed clinical records , laboratory findings , t lymphocyte subsets , chest ct scans , severity of illness , in-hospital death for continuing 187 patients with confirmed covid-19 . all information was obtained and curated with a customized data collection form . two clinical investigators ( xu and fan ) independently reviewed the data collection forms to verify data accuracy . we extract information of 187 patients of confirmed covid-19 , including demographic data , medical history , severity of illness , clinical symptoms , signs laboratory parameters on different time points , supporting therapy ( anti-virus , antibiotics , immune stimulants and respiratory support ) , survival states of patients . the admission time of included patients was between dec. 26 , 2019 and mar 1 , 2020 . \n\n laboratory procedures \n\n maternal throat swab samples were collected and tested for sars-cov-2 of our hospital laboratory department and cdc in wuhan , hubei , following who guidelines for qrt-pcr . positive confirmatory cases of covid-19 infection were defined as those with a positive test result . \n\n routine blood examinations were complete blood count , coagulation profile , serum biochemical tests ( including renal and liver function , creatine kinase and electrolytes ) , t lymphocyte subsets cd3+ t-cell , cd4+ t-cell ( cd3+cd4+ ) , cd8+ t-cell ( cd3+cd8+ ) , b-cell ( cd3-cd19+ ) and nk-cell ( cd3- ( cd16+cd56 ) + ) , myocardial enzymes , interleukin-6 ( il-6 ) , il-1beta , il-10 , serum amyloid a ( saa ) and c-reactive protein ( crp ) . t lymphocyte subsets were measured by the flow cytometry . chest computed tomographic ( ct ) scans were done for all inpatients . frequency of examinations were determined by the physician in charge . \n\n evaluation criteria of severity of illness \n\n mild illness : without symptoms and signs of severe and critically infection \n\n breathing difficulties , respiratory rate > =30bpm ; \n\n spo2 < =93 % at rest ; \n\n pao2/fio2 < = 300mmhg . \n\n severe illness ( according to one of these criteria ) : \n\n respiratory failure , and need mechanical ventilation assistant ; \n\n shock ; \n\n multi-organs failure , need transport to intensive care unit ( icu ) . \n\n critically illness : ( according to one of these criteria ) : \n\n the severity levels of covid-2019 are measured as follows : \n\n statistical analysis \n\n the continuous data was presented as median with interquartile rage ( iqr ) , and categorical data was present as frequencies with percentages . the severity of illness was categorized with mild , severe and critically ill. clinical data were classified and analyzed according to in-hospital death and severity of illness . we adopted mann-whitney u test , chi2 test or fisher exact test to compare differences between groups . to measure the possible association of t lymphocyte subsets with in-hospital death , we reported odd ratios ( ors ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) which were generated by univariate logistic regression . considering the total numbers of in-hospital death ( n=28 ) in our study , we did not adopt multivariable analysis for reasons of potential overfitting . the possible warning values of t lymphocyte subsets counts were assessed by receiver operator characteristic ( roc ) curves . the area under the roc curve ( auc ) , specificity and sensitivity were all reported . \n\n all reported statistics of the data were two sided with a significant difference of 5 % , and cis were reported as two sided 95 % cis . statistical analysis of the data performed in r v3.6.1 software ( http : //www.r-project.org ) . \n\n results \n\n the clinical characteristics of patients \n\n the admission time of patients with covid-19 grouped by hospital states . \n\n figure 1 : \n\n in this study , a total of 187 patients were enrolled , including 103 ( 55 % ) males and 84 ( 45 % ) females , median age 62-year old ( iqr [ 48.5,71 ] ) . the admission time of patients was from dec 26,2019 to mar 1,2020 ( figure 1 ) . by the end of mar 5 , 2020 , 117 patients were discharged from hospital , 28 patients died in hospital , and 45 patients still accepted treatment in hospital . only 9 patients were clustered and had exposure history of huanan seafood market and 48 patients had a contact history with confirmed covid-19 . \n\n according to the categorical criteria mentioned in methods , 80 patients ( 42.8 % ) were mild ill including 30 males ( 37.5 % ) , 45 ( 24.1 % ) patients were severe ill ( 31 males , 68.9 % ) . 62 ( 33.1 % ) patients ( 42 males , 67.7 % ) were critically ill , among which 28 patients died in hospital . more patients who died in hospital comorbid with hypertension ( n=24 , proportion , 38.7 % ) and ccd ( n=13 , proportion , 21 % ) than alive patients . both in severe-ill and critically-ill including in-hospital death group , we found older age ( median age > =60 ) than other groups ( p < 0.001 ) . in severe-ill and critically-ill patients , male gender ( higher than 60 % ) were more than mild-ill patients ( p < 0.001 ) . \n\n on admission , the common symptoms of patients were weak ( 159 patients , 85 % ) , fever ( 153 patients , 81.8 % ) , poor appetite ( 151 patients , 80.7 % ) , cough ( 145patients , 77.5 % ) and shortness of breath (

( table 3 ) . \n\n the warning values of t lymphocyte subsets to predict in-hospital death of covid-19 \n\n we adopted roc curve to find the warning values of t lymphocyte subsets lymphocyte , cd3+ t-cell , cd4+ t-cell , cd8+ t-cell , and b-cell which showed statistical difference between fatal and recover covid-19 . the warning values ( /ul ) to predict in-hospital death of lymphocyte , cd3+ t-cell , cd4+ t-cell , cd8+ t-cell , and b-cell were 559 , 235 , 104 , 85 and 82 , respectively . lower than warning values of t lymphocyte subsets indicated a significantly higher risk of in-hospital death . ( table 3 ) \n\n discussion \n\n in this study , all patients , especially in severe-ill and critically-ill including dead patients , exhibited a significant drop of t lymphocyte subsets counts with remarkably increasing concentrations of saa and crp compared to normal values . in critically-ill patients , the median counts of lymphocyte , cd3+ t-cell , cd4+ t-cell , and cd8+ t-cell were almost decreased to a third of median counts of mild-ill patients , which is equal to nearly half of median counts of severe-ill patients . 28 patients died in hospital , the median lymphocyte , cd3+ t-cell , cd4+ t-cell , cd8+ t-cell , b-cell , and nk-cell were obviously lower than other critically-ill patients . meanwhile , as the severity of illness getting worse , the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines getting higher . the median concentration of saa in critically-ill patients was nearly 4-fold to that of mild-ill patients . the median concentration of crp in critically-ill patients was nearly 10-fold to that of mild-ill patients . lower counts ( /ul ) of t lymphocyte subsets lymphocyte ( < 500 ) , cd3+t-cell ( < 200 ) , cd4+ t-cell ( < 100 ) , cd8+ t-cell ( < 100 ) , and b-cell ( < 50 ) were associated with higher risk of in-hospital death . the warning values of lymphocyte , cd3+ t-cell , cd4+ t-cell , cd8+ t-cell , and b-cell were 559 , 235 , 104 , 85 and 82 , respectively . \n\n t cell-mediated immunity is the central element of the adaptive immune system and includes a primary response by naive t cells . each t lymphocyte expresses a unique t cell receptor ( tcr ) on the surface . mature t lymphocytes known as naive t cells , circulate through blood and the lymphatic system and reside in secondary lymphoid organs . all t lymphocytes have the t-cell receptor ( tcr ) and pan-t-cell co-receptor cd3 . cd4+ t cells recognize mhc 1 bound antigens , while cd8+ t cells recognize the mhc 1 bound antigens . both cd4+ t cells , and cd8+ t cells have the co-receptor cd3 . and the sum total counts of cd4+ t cells and cd8+ cells are almost equal to or slightly more than cd3+ cells . damage to t lymphocytes , impressed immunity and related high levels of inflammatory cytokines might be important factor to exacerbation and mortality of patients . previous sars-cov infection stimulated cytokines il-1 , il-10 etc. , and t lymphocyte subsets cd4+t-cell and cd8+t-cell were decreased after onset of the disease as well . t-cell mediated immunity is an adaptive process of developing antigen- ( ag ) specific t lymphocytes to eliminate sars-cov-2 invasion . since cd4+ t cells are central in the origin and regulation of autoimmunity , emphasis has been placed on the characterization of th subsets and their possible roles in the inflammatory process . il-1beta serves as the major mediator of inflammatory diseases , including autoimmune , infectious and degenerative ones . in the central nervous system ( cns ) , it acts as endogenous pyrogen inducing fever , and systemically , it induces the acute phase response , either directly or indirectly via the induction of il-6 production . il-6 is one of the key mediators regulating inflammation . upon activation by infectious agents like sars-cov-2 , il-6 is produced by macrophages , endothelial cells , and t cells and activate many tissue cells , including endothelial cells and parenchymal cells to produce effector molecules of inflammation . il-10 is mainly produced by monocytes and t cells and the most potent anti-inflammatory cytokine , which reduces inflammatory processes and thus limits collateral inflammation-induced tissue damage . on one hand , sars-cov-2 invasion activated t cell-mediated immunity which resulted in increasing production of inflammatory cytokine . however , inhibition cytokines such as il-10 can suppress t cell activation conversely . on the other hand , saa and crp are both of acute-phase proteins in response to inflammatory cytokines related by activated monocytes/macrophages after infections . high levels of saa and crp could reflect the severity of inflammation and result in a `` cytokine storm '' , during which inflammation spreads throughout the body via the circulation . several studies revealed that a substantial decrease in total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus consumes many immune cells and inhibits the body 's cellular immune function . sars causes similar decrease of t lymphocyte , severe lung injury and spleen shrinkage , which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) . until now , no antiviral treatment for coronavirus infection has been proven to be effective . now , we faced on urgent need to elucidate what are the risk factors for severe illness or death . therefore , our study tries to partly answer this question to help with the clinical practice and better know this disease . \n\n the study has several limitations . first , we adopted this research in a retrospective method , which may limit the strength and reliability of our results . second , all enrolled patients were from one central with inevitable selective bias . third , not all laboratory tests were done in all patients , including il-1beta , il-6 and il-10 . therefore , we did not assess the association of these cytokines with in-hospital death . fourth , considering our limited sample size , we did not include other potential risk factors such as gender and age into multivariate logistic regression to assess the risk factors of t lymphocyte subsets . this may limit the interpretations of our results . however , since we are the first hospital to admit covid-19 patients and reported it to chinese cdc , we believe our study population and findings are representative and reliable . \n\n to our knowledge , this is the first clinical study to exhibit significant suppressed t cell subsets and its possible association to in-hospital death and severity of covid-19 . in addition , we assessed and analyzed inflammatory cytokines produced by t cells on admission . in summary , we find a significant decrease of t lymphocyte subset is positive correlated with in-hospital death and severity of illness . lower counts ( /ul ) of t lymphocyte subsets lymphocyte ( < 500 ) , cd3+t-cell ( < 200 ) , cd4+ t-cell ( < 100 ) , cd8+ t-cell ( < 100 ) and b-cell ( < 50 ) counts were exhibited higher risk of in-hospital death . the warning values of cd3+ t-cell , cd4+ t-cell , cd8+ t-cell , and b-cell were 559 , 235 , 104 , 85 and 82 , respectively . the decrease levels of t lymphocyte subsets reported in our study were not common among other virus infection , which may be a possible biomarker for early diagnosis . our findings may shed light on early warning of high risk of mortality and help early intervention and treatment . \n\n declaration of competing interest \n\n we declare no competing interests . \n\n references \n\n & lt ; em & gt ; severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus

01100000	the role of afferent pulmonary innervation in poor prognosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome in covid-19 patients and proposed use of resiniferatoxin ( rtx ) to improve patient outcomes in advanced disease state : a review . \n\n acute respiratory distress is one of the major causes of mortality associated with covid-19 disease . many patients will require intensive care with ventilatory support . despite progress and best efforts , the mortality rates projected remain high . historical data outlook points towards 80 % expected fatality for patients progressing to advanced pulmonary disease , even when hospitalized in the intensive care unit . this is particularly true among the patient population over 65 . novel life-saving strategies are desperately needed to mitigate the high mortality that will be associated with the late stage sars-cov-2 viral infection associated with the fatal respiratory distress . we hypothesize that the morbidity , severity of the disease , and underlying physiological events leading to mortality are closely linked to the trpv1 expressing neuronal system ( afferent/efferent neurons ) in the lungs . trpv1 expressing cells are responsible for pain transmission , inflammation and immunomodulation throughout the entire pulmonary system and are modulating the processes associated with localized cytokine release ( storm ) and overall rapid disease progression . we suggest that therapeutic approaches targeting trpv1 containing nerve fibers in the lungs will modulate the inflammatory and immune signal activity , leading to reduced mortality and better overall outcomes . we also propose to further explore the use of resiniferatoxin ( rtx ) , an ultra-potent trpv1 agonist currently in clinical trials for cancer and osteoarthritis pain , as a possible ablating agent of trpv1 positive pulmonary pathways in patients with advanced covid-19 disease . 
10000000	symptom cluster of icu nurses treating covid-19 pneumonia patients in wuhan , china \n\n objective \n\n in treating highly infectious covid-19 pneumonia , icu nurses face a high risk of developing somatic symptom disorder ( ssd ) . the present study aims to investigate the symptoms and causes of ssd of icu nurses treating covid-19 pneumonia . the research results are expected to provide evidence for the establishment of a better management strategy . \n\n methods \n\n this study enrolled a total of 140 icu nurses who were selected by jiangsu province hospital to work in wuhan ( the epicenter of the covid-19 epidemic in china ) on 3rd february 2020 . a questionnaire `` somatic symptom disorders for icu nurses in wuhan no.1 hospital '' was designed based on the `` international classification of functioning , disability and health '' ( icf ) . exploratory factor analysis was performed to cluster the symptoms , and logistic regression analysis to find the risk factors of the symptoms . \n\n results \n\n five major symptoms were chest-discomfort-and-palpitation ( 31.4 % ) , dyspnea ( 30.7 % ) , nausea ( 21.4 % ) , headache ( 19.3 % ) , and dizziness ( 17.9 % ) . in exploratory factor analysis , the symptoms were classified into three clusters : cluster a of breathing and sleep disturbances ( dizziness , sleepiness , dyspnea ) ; cluster b of gastrointestinal complaints and pain ( nausea , headache ) , and cluster c of general symptoms ( xerostomia , fatigue , chest-discomfort-and-palpitation ) . in cluster a , urine/feces splash , sex , and sputum splash were independent predictive factors . in cluster b , fall of protective glasses and urine/feces splash were independent predictive factors . in cluster c , urine/feces splash and urine/feces clearance were independent predictive factors . \n\n conclusion \n\n the icu nurses in wuhan showed varying and overlapping ssds . these ssds could be classified into three symptom clusters . based on the characteristics of their ssds , specific interventions could be implemented to safeguard the health of icu nurses . \n\n introduction \n\n covid-19 pneumonia has been listed category b infectious disease and is being treated in a category similar to that of category a by the national health commission of china . a large proportion of covid-19 patients will progress to a critical condition which needs intensive care . however , given the challenges in treating this disease , icu nurses are highly prone to somatic symptom disorder ( ssd ) which is associated with the interaction of biology , cognition , emotion , behavior and environment . the icu nurses must manage a heavy workload requiring frequent invasive procedures and high attention levels . therefore , safeguarding the physical and psychological health of icu nurses can provide a major contribution to the success of epidemic control . a symptom cluster is a stable group of two or more co-existing symptoms . the symptom clusters in one population may show overlaps and interactions , a phenomenon that should be resolved to improve the efficiency of managing the disorder . currently , no study has investigated ssds in icu nurses fighting at the frontline against the covid-19 epidemic . previous studies have confirmed that an individual 's response to ssd is dependent on physical , emotional and social factors . this study aims to analyze ssds and associated risk factors in 140 icu nurses who were sent by jiangsu province hospital to no.1 hospital of wuhan , the epicenter of covid-19 epidemic . \n\n methods \n\n sample \n\n a total of 140 nurses at covid-19 pneumonia icus were selected through convenience sampling . inclusion criteria : ( 1 ) employed as a full-time nurse at jiangsu province hospital ;

1 , mild ; 2 , moderate ; 3 , severe ) . \n\n another questionnaire was designed to evaluate the possible risk factors . included in this questionnaire were three datasets : demographic data ( sex , age , educational background , marriage , etc . ) , career data ( working years , working years in a particular department , previous in-hospital rotation , title , position , technical level , etc . ) , and data about icu work in wuhan ( frequency and time in icu , extra work , exposure to contaminants and treatment , invasive procedures , etc . ) . \n\n procedures \n\n the questionnaires were handed out through wechat , an online app . participants who met the study criteria logged onto a website ( http : //www.wjx.cn ) to complete the survey . the investigators informed the nurses of the details of the research . all the questionnaires were completed and returned ( an efficiency of 100 % ) 5-7 days after the first group of icu nurses started work in wuhan the study was approved by the ethics committee of jiangsu province hospital ( 2020-sr-101 ) . \n\n data analysis \n\n the data were analyzed with spss 25.0 . descriptive analysis was performed for the data on general characteristics and ssds . enumeration data were presented as frequencies and percentages , measurement data in normal distributions as mean+-sd , and measurement data in skewed distributions as medians and interquartile ranges . exploratory factor analysis was performed to assess the presence of correlations between particular types of symptoms which might reflect symptom complexes . to express the symptoms accurately , this study included the variables ranking in the top 10 in both frequency and severity . factor loading was calculated through principal component analysis and rotation through varimax . the factors were selected according to the following criteria : ( 1 ) eigenvalue > 1 ( kaiser criterion ) ; ( 2 ) suitable for cattell 's 16 personality factors test ; ( 3 ) containing at least two within factor variance ; ( 4 ) having psychological implications ; ( 5 ) loadings of 0.5 or higher . logistic regression analysis was used to explain the interrelationships of symptom clusters and variables in three datasets ( demographic data , career data , and data about icu work ) , alpha=0.05 . \n\n results \n\n sample characteristics \n\n number ( % ) educational background junior college degree 30 21.4 bachelor 's degree 109 77.9 master 's degree 1 0.7 title nurse 23 16.4 senior nurse 81 57.9 supervisor nurse 32 22.9 co-chief superintendent nurse 4 2.9 position nurse 136 97.1 head nurse 4 2.9 technical level n0-n1 74 52.9 n2 36 25.7 n3 28 20 n4 2 1.4 in-hospital rotation ( x+-s ) 2.14+-1.38 \n\n general data of the nurses \n\n during one week ( 15-22 february 2020 ) after the nurses started the work in icus in wuhan no.1 hospital , 63 person-times of covid-19 pneumonia cases were admitted , including 35 serious/critical cases ( 55.56 % ) and 3 deaths ( 4.76 % ) . a total of 140 nurses were surveyed , including 118 females ( 84.3 % ) , and 63 married nurses ( 45 % ) . the mean age was 29.35+-4.92 years ( range 22-43 years ) . the nurses had worked for a mean of 7.03+-5.44 years ( range 1-23 years ) , and a mean of 3.66+-3.70 years ( range 1-18 years ) in a particular department ( such as icu , emergency , respiratory department , infectious disease department ) . other general data are shown in table 2 . \n\n scores of ssd symptoms \n\n each nurse showed a median of 1.5 ( mean 2.04+-2.11 ) ssd symptoms and a median of 2 ( 3.88+-6.13 ) symptom onsets . the 10 most frequent symptoms were chest-discomfort-and-palpitation ( 31.4 % ) , dyspnea ( 30.7 % ) , nausea ( 21.4 % ) , headache ( 19.3 % ) , dizziness ( 17.9 % ) , xerostomia ( 15.7 % ) , fatigue ( 15.0 % ) , sleepiness ( 9.3 % ) , sweating ( 8.6 % ) , and waist pain ( 7.1 % ) . the 10 most severe symptoms were dyspnea ( 0.74+-1.17 ) , chest-discomfort-and-palpitation ( 0.62+-1.02 ) , headache ( 0.40+-0.90 ) , fatigue ( 0.30+-0.77 ) , xerostomia ( 0.30+-0.75 ) , dizziness ( 0.29+-0.71 ) , nausea ( 0.29+-0.61 ) , sleepiness ( 0.19+-0.66 ) , dry eyes ( 0.14+-0.56 ) , and diarrhea ( 0.13+-0.61 ) . \n\n symptom clusters \n\n no.1 no.2 no.3 cluster score ( x+-s ) dizziness 0.71 - - 1.22+-1.88 sleepiness 0.68 - - dyspnea 0.621 - - nausea - 0.819 - 0.69+-1.17 headache - 0.596 - xerostomia - - 0.815 1.22+-1.89 fatigue - - 0.637 chest-discomfort-and-palpitation - - 0.51 explained variance ( % ) 21.75 17.1 16.91 - \n\n symptom clusters of icu nurses \n\n exploratory factor analysis was performed based on eight ssds , the frequency and severity of which both ranked in the top 10 , including nausea , chest-discomfort-and-palpitation , dyspnea , sleepiness , dizziness , fatigue , xerostomia , and headache . kmo value of 0.694 and p < 0.001 ( bartlett 's sphericity test ) indicated these factors were suitable for factor analysis . the results showed three common factors ( eigenvalue > 1 ) explaining 55.75 % of common variance . after rotation with varimax , the factor loadings were calculated , as shown by the matrix in table 3 . finally , three symptom clusters were defined : cluster a of breathing and sleep disturbances ( dizziness , sleepiness , dyspnea ) ; cluster b of gastrointestinal complaints and pain ( nausea , headache ) ; and cluster c of general symptoms ( xerostomia , fatigue , chest-discomfort-and-palpitation ) . the score of each cluster was the total of each symptom score ( table 3 ) . \n\n risk factors of symptom clusters \n\n operation person-times proportion exposure person-times proportion endotracheal intubation 6 1.00 fall of protective glasses 12 26.09 deep vein catheterization 3 0.50 fall of mask 4 8.70 venous indwelling needle 26 4.34 fall of shield 1 2.17 artery indwelling needle 0 0.00 glove fall 8 17.39 open suction 21 3.51 glove broken 8 17.39 close suction 137 22.87 protective garment broken 0 0.00 clearing oral and nasal secretions 84 14.02 protective garment contaminated 3 6.52 replacing the instruments fixing the endotracheal tube 3 0.50 blood splash 1 2.17 sputum sample collection 16 2.67 sputum splash 3 6.52 blood sample collection 35 5.84 urine/feces splash 1 2.17 venous transfusion 91 15.19 others 5 10.87 venous injection 35 5.84 urine/feces clearance 116 19.37 corpse treatment 5 0.83 others 19 3.17 \n\n nursing operations and types of exposure \n\n table 4 shows the 15 types of nursing operations and 11 types of exposure . a total of 599 person-times of invasive operations ( 4.28+-7.49 times per person ) and 46 person-times of body fluid/blood exposure ( 0.33+-0.58 times per person ) were reported . on average , one nurse accomplished 2.57+-0.95 shifts of icu work . a total of 16 nurses ( 11.4 % ) had taken on extra work . \n\n variables regression coefficient se standardized regression coefficient t p cluster a ( constant ) 1.924 0.755 2.55 0.012 urine/feces splash 1.252 0.195 0.457 6.417 0.000 sex -0.82 0.397 -0.133 -2.063 0.041 sputum splash 1.46 0.237 0.4 6.16 0.000 r=0.669 , f=27.306 , p=0.000 cluster b ( constant ) 0.41 0.092 4.475 0.000 fall of protective glasses 0.55 0.266 0.153 2.066 0.041 urine/feces splash 0.69 0.106 0.48 6.483 0.000 r=0.789 , f=27.547 , p=0.000 cluster c urine/feces splash 1.982 0.17 0.693 11.651 0.000 urine/feces clearance 0.32 0.105 0.186 3.06 0.003 r=0.789 , f=31.097 , p=0.000 \n\n logistic regression analysis on the risk factors of three symptom clusters \n\n taking the occurrence of symptom clusters as a dependent variable and the factors in the three datasets as independent variables , the univariate cox regression analysis showed that sex , sputum splash , urine/feces splash , and urine/feces clearance were risk factors for the occurrence of symptom clusters ( p < 0.05 ) . using these risk factors as independent variables and the occurrence of symptom clusters as a dependent variable , the multiple linear regression analysis showed that urine/feces splash , female , and sputum splash were independent predictive factors for cluster a ; fall of protective glasses and urine/feces splash were independent predictive factors of cluster b ; and urine/feces splash and urine/feces clearance were independent predictive factors for cluster c ( table 5 ) . \n\n discussion \n\n on 30 january 2020 , the world health organization ( who ) declared covid-19 a `` public health emergency of international concern '' . the infection , with a route of human-to-human transmission , caused clusters of severe respiratory illness that was associated with icu admission and high mortality . china has quickly pooled medical personnel into wuhan , the origin of the epidemic in china . a major workforce are icu nurses , who are exposed to a broad range of mental and physical health disorders . particular efforts to mitigate these challenges must be directed to the icu nurses under the greatest workload . by investigating the symptom clusters experienced by nurses and associated risk factors , a better management model may be developed to relieve the ssds in icu nurses . \n\n we found that the icu nurses reported symptoms which could be grouped into three symptom clusters and that the median number of symptoms in each nurse was 1.5 . a night shift could be expected to lead to sleepiness and fatigue . previous studies have studied symptom clusters in patients with cancer or chronic disease . the present study is the first to investigate symptom clusters in icu nurses in an epidemic . \n\n our study showed that dizziness , sleepiness and dyspnea co-occurred in cluster a ; headache and nausea in cluster b ; xerostomia , fatigue and chest-discomfort-and-palpitation in cluster c. we confirmed that the occurrence of symptom clusters was caused by the environmental and personal stress disorder . for infection control , personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , such as a fluid-resistant gown , gloves , eye protection , full face shield and fit-tested n95 respirators , should be worn . however , accidental events when using this equipment , such as fall of protective glasses , may harm both the physical and mental health of nurses . in this study , we showed an association between ppe failure and symptom cluster b . it was previously reported that sleepiness coexisted with other symptoms in a single cluster . interventions , including physical exercise or cognitive behavioral therapy , could relieve the symptoms in the sleepiness-related cluster . \n\n in wuhan , most icu patients required high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support to correct hypoxemia . nursing of critical patients included condition monitoring , sequential oxygen care , sequential treatment nursing , infection prevention , nutrition support , and psychological nursing . in our study , 55.56 % of patients were in critical condition . our results showed that supervisor nurses had more exposures to infectious material and a heavier workload ( 4.28+-7.49 invasive operations and 0.33+-0.58 exposures per person ) . \n\n we identified urine/feces splash as an independent risk factor associated with the occurrence of all symptom clusters , which can be explained by three reasons . firstly , patients ' excreta may create aerosols that can allow airborne transmission to those closely involved in the procedure . secondly , the fecal-oral route of transmission is possible . thirdly , the proportion of patients needing urine/feces clearance ( 116 , 19.37 % ) was high , second only to that of closed sputum aspiration ( 137 , 22.87 % ) . our finding suggested that it is important to develop standard procedures to prevent icu nurses from urine/feces splash . \n\n we found that female was a significant factor associated with occurrence of the symptom cluster of breathing and sleep disturbances . several previous studies showed that female nurses have a higher risk of daytime sleepiness than male nurses . to mitigate this risk , care should be given to female icu nurses if they suffer from daytime sleepiness . \n\n finally , our results showed that fall of protective glasses was an independent risk factor for the occurrence of the pain symptom cluster . blocking transmission is a leading strategy against covid-19 . this finding shows the importance of ppe . a nurse may develop adverse reactions caused by heavy ppe , including nausea and vomiting . we suggest identifying infection control nurses as observers to monitor staff compliance with infection control guidance , give clarification and advice where appropriate and record significant issues relating to infection control procedures . \n\n limitations \n\n our study has several limitations . first , only 140 nurses were included ; the findings should be validated with studies covering more professionals . second , other centers should be included to get a more comprehensive understanding . \n\n conclusions \n\n the icu nurses in wuhan showed varying and overlapping ssds . these ssds could be classified into three symptom clusters . based on the characteristics of their ssds , specific interventions could be implemented to guarantee the health of icu nurses . future research should still focus on the change of ssds through a long term outbreak . \n\n uncited reference \n\n . \n\n references \n\n reducing the stress on clinicians working in the icu \n\n clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in wuhan , china \n\n the covid-19 epidemic \n\n symptom clusters : concept analysis and clinical implications for cancer nursing \n\n the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions in the management of symptom clusters in adult cancer patients : a systematic review protocol \n\n cognitive and affective factors predicting daily somatic complaints in college students \n\n world health organization . international classification of functioning , disability and health ( icf ) . geneva : who ;

00001000	the impact of covid-19 on neurosurgeons and the strategy for triaging non-emergent operations : a global neurosurgery study \n\n object \n\n the covid-19 pandemic has disrupted all aspects of society globally . as healthcare resources had to be preserved for infected patients , and the risk of in-hospital procedures escalated for uninfected patients and staff , neurosurgeons around the world have had to postpone non-emergent procedures . under these unprecedented conditions , the decision to defer cases became increasingly difficult as covid-19 cases skyrocketed . \n\n methods \n\n data was collected by self-reporting surveys during two discrete periods : the principal survey accrued responses during 2 weeks at the peak of the global pandemic , and the supplemental survey accrued responses after that to detect changes in opinions and circumstances . nine hypothetical surgical scenarios were used to query neurosurgeons ' opinion on the risk of postponement and the urgency to re-schedule the procedures . an acuity index was generated for each scenario , and this was used to rank the nine cases . \n\n results \n\n there were 494 respondents to the principal survey from 60 countries . 258 ( 52.5 % ) reported that all elective cases and clinics have been shut down by their main hospital . a total of 226 respondents ( 46.1 % ) reported that their operative volume had dropped more than 50 % . for the countries most affected by covid-19 , this proportion was 54.7 % . there was a high degree of agreement among our respondents that fast-evolving neuro-oncological cases are non-emergent cases that nonetheless have the highest risk in postponement , and selected vascular cases may have high acuity as well . \n\n conclusion \n\n we report on the impact of covid-19 on neurosurgeons around the world . from their ranking of the nine case scenarios , we deduced a strategic scheme that can serve as a guideline to triage non-emergent neurosurgical procedures during the pandemic . with it , hopefully , neurosurgeons can continue to serve their patients without endangering them either neurologically or risking their exposure to the deadly virus . \n\n electronic supplementary material \n\n the online version of this article ( 10.1007/s00701-020-04342-5 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users . \n\n introduction \n\n as the novel coronavirus ( sars-cov-2 ) swept across the globe , the covid-19 pandemic has disrupted all aspects of society , with a breadth and intensity unfathomable for those born after the last world war . with relatively few neurological manifestations , neurosurgeons have been sheltered from `` frontline action '' that is battering subspecialists in emergency , intensive care and pulmonary medicine , but nevertheless , the practice of neurosurgery is yet susceptible to the havoc that covid-19 has wrought . on a systems level , teams of neurosurgeons have been re-deployed as intensivists , neurosurgical patients have been re-housed in covid-clean wards , protocols have been implemented to test patients ahead of neurosurgical procedures , and hospital systems have been reorganized to `` hub-and-spoke '' configurations to segregate neurosurgery to designated centers . \n\n on a personal level , neurosurgeons have also had to make adjustments . as hospitals tried to conserve precise resources for the tsunami of patients , governments worked to protect uninfected citizens , and medical societies strived to support physicians and nurses , neurosurgeons have been mandated to drastically alter their practices as the entire world mobilized to combat sars-cov-2 . on march 13 , 2020 , the american college of surgeons ( acs ) issued an unprecedented recommendation to `` minimize , postpone or cancel electively scheduled operations '' . as covid-19 cases skyrocketed in the usa that week , the american hospital association and center for medicare and medicaid services quickly followed the acs and issued similar recommendations . intuitively rational , medically sound , and worded respectful of the decision-making skills well-honed over decades of training , these recommendations nonetheless confounded neurosurgeons as they left the definition of `` elective '' to each individual practitioner . \n\n on a daily basis , neurosurgeons identify life-threatening emergencies , and hardly any would argue , for example , that a healthy patient with a grade i aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage can wait for treatment even during a pandemic . similarly , with those aforementioned sharp decision-making skills , neurosurgeons can readily determine that , an incidentally discovered 1 cm vestibular schwannoma , can wait for treatment until sars-cov-2 has been thoroughly defeated . however , between these two examples are the problematic cases , for which the risk of postponement is left to the unknowable pace of disease progression , or worse , dependent only on chance . \n\n we designed this survey study to ( a ) determine the degree to which the current pandemic has disrupted the practice of neurosurgeons around the globe and across all types of practice and ( b ) to discover any pattern of thought or decision-making process that leads neurosurgeons to decide what operation can be postponed and for how long . with the assumption that neurosurgeons are well-trained to recognize the extremes of the `` elective-to-emergent '' spectrum , we concentrated on the middle , where the decision to postpone is the most challenging . \n\n methods \n\n participation in the study \n\n for this study , the aim was to `` spot-check '' and compare the worldwide impact of covid-19 on neurosurgical practices . neurosurgeons around the world were invited to participate in the study survey between march and april 2020 . the principal study started 2 days after the acs issued its recommendation ( march 16 ) and lasted for 2 weeks . as the pandemic evolved rapidly , a supplemental study was designed to capture the changes in hospitals ' responses and surgeons ' perspectives . this phase was `` live '' from march 23 to april 3 . using the international contact network of global brainsurgery initiative , and relying especially on the senior author 's ( wcj ) social media following , the invitation to complete the survey was broadcasted over social media , through neurosurgery-specific groups/clubs/channels on platforms which included facebook , instagram , linkedin , twitter , and whatsapp . the survey relied on voluntary self-reporting . although the survey was accessible to anyone with internet access , the first page of it clearly stated that respondents must be a neurosurgeon , trainees included . \n\n in strict adherence to the us federal regulation for irb exemption 45 cfr 36104 ( d ) ( 4 , ii ) , once a response was accepted into the study , it was immediately and permanently anonymized . all information which can identify the respondent , which , in this survey is only the email that was left to the respondent as an option to provide , was detached from the rest of the survey answers and permanently deleted . the response was then given a subject number for identification during the study . \n\n survey design \n\n a survey was specifically designed for this study . the principal study consisted of 20 questions written in english , the first 11 of which queried the respondents ' practice setting , country , current societal and practice conditions relevant to the pandemic , and his or her opinion about the shutdown of surgeries . the degree to which cancelation of elective cases has been applied by hospital policy , or should be applied according to personal opinion , was queried with 4 tiers : none , at surgeons ' discretion , some , and all cases . nine questions formed the second half of the survey , and these pertained to hypothetical case scenarios and the risk of postponing surgery for each . \n\n in the supplement of the survey , respondents were asked whether they ( personally ) , the country or the hospital has changed policy since the start of the study on march 16 , 2020 . the same nine hypothetical case scenarios formed the second part of the supplemental phase , but this time , the question pertained to the length of reasonable postponement . both phases for the study were intended to be anonymous , and self-identification of the respondents was voluntary . participation in either phase may be mutually exclusive . \n\n an acuity rank and algorithm \n\n nine hypothetical case scenarios were presented to the respondents ( appendix 1 in the esm ) . for each case , respondents in the principal study were asked to stratify the risk of postponing surgery into four tiers from none to severe . there were 448 respondents to these questions . during analysis , a `` risk score '' was generated by converting each response into a number : from 1 for `` no risk , '' to 4 for `` can not postpone . '' in the supplement , the same scenarios were presented , this time asking for how much longer than a week the operation can be reasonably put off . there were 315 respondents . an `` urgency score '' was generated by converting each response into a number from 1 to 5 . average scores were calculated , and the average `` risk score '' was multiplied by the `` urgency score '' for each case to generate an `` acuity index '' ( ai ) . the nine cases were then ranked to produce the acuity rank order for the study . \n\n the `` acuity index '' was calculated another way to check for internal consistency . since the identity of the respondent is not required for completion of the survey , leaving an email address on either phase was voluntary . however , 166 respondents left their emails on both phases , and we matched up all their responses . for these , we calculated a personal acuity index ( pai ) by multiplying the individual 's risk score for each question in the principal phase to the urgency score in the supplemental phase . the average of the product ( pai166 ) was generated for each of the nine scenarios , ranked and compared to the total cohort . \n\n statistical analysis \n\n descriptive statistics were used to characterize the overall responses from the study cohort . continuous variables were reported as the mean and were compared using a 2-tailed student 's t test . categorical variables were reported as proportions and were compared using chi2 test . univariable ordinal and logistic regression analyses to identify predictors of personal view and hospital response were performed . in addition , multivariable ordinal and logistic regression analyses , initially including all potential predictor variables , with stepwise backward elimination of non-contributory variables ( p > 0.10 ) , to identify independent predictors of personal view and hospital response were also performed . for each of the hypothetical questions , percentage agreement was calculated by computing the number of rater scores with exact agreement divided by the total number of possible rater scores . \n\n all tests were 2-sided , and a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant . statistical analysis was performed using excel ( version 15.36 , 2017 , microsoft , redmond wa ) and stata ( version 15.1 , statacorp. , college station tx ) .

covid-19 , 2019 novel coronavirus ; c.i. , confidence interval , p value , probability value \n\n high prevalence of covid-19 infections and governmental policy to close shops and restaurants were strong predictors of hospital policy to cancel elective cases and clinics on univariate analysis ( table 2 , p < .001 ) , but the influence of case numbers did not reach significance in multi-variate analysis . as expected , there was a significant correlation between hospital policy and the surgeon 's self-reported decrease in operative volume ( table 2 , p < .001 ) . higher number of covid-19 cases was also a predictor of neurosurgeons ' views in support of cancelation of elective cases on univariate analysis ( table 3 , p = .02 ) , but formal training in covid-2 did not have a significant influence ( p = .16 ) . governmental policy for social distancing/lockdown and hospital shutdown were also significant predictors of neurosurgeons ' views in support of case cancelations on univariate analysis , but only the hospital policy was significant in multi-variate analysis ( table 4 , p < 0.001 ) . \n\n the influence of practice setting and geography \n\n respondents who practice in `` for-profit '' settings were less likely to experience stringent hospital mandates to cancel elective cases in both uni- and multi-variate analyses ( tables 2 and 4 ) . in contrast , neurosurgeons in non-profit practices were more likely to support postponement of cases ( p = .003 , table 3 ) , but this correlation stopped short of being statistically significant on multi-variate analysis ( table 4 , p = .09 ) . \n\n neurosurgeons in lmic were less likely to experience hospital shutdown or support cancelation of cases ( tables 2 and 4 ) , likely reflecting the fact that the hardest hit countries right now are non-lmic . there were 200 respondents from the usa , where the tide of the pandemic rose most dramatically . within the 2 weeks when the principal phase was actively accruing responses , the case numbers went from 4743 ( march 16 ) to 142,793 ( march 30 ) . for these respondents , the date of the survey response was a positive predictor of hospital response in both uni- and multi-variate analysis ( or = 1.33 [ 95 % c.i . 1.11-1.61 , p = .003 , or = 1.32 [ 95 % c.i . 1.03-1.69 ] p = .03 respectively ) and it was also a predictor of the neurosurgeon 's personal view on univariate analysis ( o.r . = 1.08 [ 95 % c.i . 1.00-1.16 ] p = .04 ) . \n\n responses in the supplemental phase \n\n the supplemental phase of the survey received 378 responses . there were 166 respondents who attached their email addresses matchable to their responses to the principal study . three hundred and eleven ( 82 % ) of the supplemental respondents reported that their hospital policy had become more stringent since the start of the study , whereas 213 ( 56 % ) had themselves changed their opinion about the elective case shutdown , once again indicating the fluid nature of the pandemic . \n\n `` risk score '' for the nine cases \n\n responses to the nine case scenarios . a respondents were asked to stratify the risk of postponing surgery for each case into four tiers from `` no risk '' ( 1 ) to `` can not postpone '' ( 4 ) . the average `` risk score '' and percentage agreement are shown on the right . b respondents were asked to stratify the urgency to re-schedule the same nine cases into 5 tiers from `` leave until the end of the pandemic '' ( 1 ) to `` case already done '' ( 5 ) . the average `` urgency score '' and percentage agreement are shown on the right . ( nb : since there are a different number of options in `` risk '' and `` urgency , '' neither the average or percentage agreement are not comparable between `` risk '' and `` urgency '' ) \n\n the opinions on the risk of postponement are shown in fig . 2a . the average `` risk scores '' were highest for the giant ophthalmic aneurysm ( q7 ) and cerebellar metastasis ( q3 ) case examples , which were both 3.5 . the lowest average `` risk score '' was for the vestibular schwannoma ( q2 ) at 2.47 . the percentages agreement were also highest for the giant aneurysm and cerebellar metastasis ( 46.5 % , 46.3 % respectively ) , indicative of more agreement among the respondents on these cases . the lowest percent agreement and most disagreement was for the avm ( q9 ) case scenario ( 31.2 % ) . \n\n excluding the risk scores of neurosurgical trainees ( 0-8 years in the field ) , and comparing only neurosurgeons in independent practice with the total cohort , the average risk score was not significantly different for 8 of the 9 scenarios . the only significant change occurred with the avm case where the average risk score dropped from 2.7 ( all respondents ) to 2.56 ( all respondents minus trainees , two-tailed student 's t test , p = 0.03 ) . however , this did not have any impact on the risk ranking among the nine cases , as the avm remained with the third lowest score , only above the pituitary adenoma and vestibular schwannoma case examples . \n\n `` urgency score '' for the nine cases and the acuity index \n\n ave risk score ( n = 448 ) ave urgency score ( n = 315 ) acuity index ( rank ) pai166 ( rank ) cerebellar met 3.51 4.22 14.8 ( 1 ) 15.5 ( 1 ) giant aneurysm 3.50 3.96 13.9 ( 2 ) 13.9 ( 3 ) gbm 3.39 3.86 13.1 ( 3 ) 14.2 ( 2 ) spinal met 3.12 3.76 11.7 ( 4 ) 12.3 ( 4 ) carotid 3.14 3.45 10.8 ( 5 ) 10.9 ( 5 ) c45 disc 2.81 3.09 8.68 ( 6 ) 8.73 ( 6 ) pituitary tumor 2.68 2.80 7.50 ( 7 ) 7.87 ( 7 ) avm 2.70 2.48 6.70 ( 8 ) 6.67 ( 8 ) vs 2.47 2.37 5.85 ( 9 ) 6.28 ( 9 ) \n\n the acuity index was calculated by multiplying the average risk score ( from the principal study ) to the average urgency index ( from the supplement study ) . the rank of the ai in the group of nine cases is shown in parenthesis . the pai166 was calculated for each case as follows : for each respondent who identifiably completed both parts of the study , the risk score ( principal phase ) was multiplied to same respondent 's urgency score for the same case ( supplement phase ) to generate a personal acuity index ( pai ) for that case . the average for the 166 respondents was recorded under pai166 ( rank in parenthesis ) \n\n the opinions on the urgency to re-schedule the so-called elective cases of postponement are shown in fig . 2b . the average `` urgency scores '' and percentages agreement were highest once again for the cerebellar metastasis ( q3 4.22 , 37.0 % ) ) and giant ophthalmic aneurysm ( q7 3.96 , 36.4 % ) . by multiplying the average risk score from the principal phase to the average urgency score of the supplemental phase , the acuity index for each case was generated and ranked ( table 5 ) . according to the total cohort in the full study , the acuity rank was highest for the cerebellar metastasis ( ai = 14.8 ) and lowest for the vestibular schwannoma ( ai = 5.85 ) . \n\n in sub-group analysis for the 166 respondents who were identifiable in both the principal and supplemental phases , a personal acuity index was calculated by multiplying the individual respondent 's risk and urgency scores for each case . the average of these ( pai166 ) generated the same ranking of the nine cases except for one pair ; the gbm and aneurysm cases switched positions . however , the pai166 for these two cases were not statistically different ( 14.2 vs. 14.0 , two-tailed t test , p = .74 ) . \n\n discussion \n\n reasons behind the impact of covid-19 on neurosurgery \n\n nearly half of the respondents in this study for around the world ( 46.1 % ) reported that their operative volume has dropped more than 50 % during the pandemic . even more neurosurgeons ( 61.4 % ) opined that all elective cases should be postponed . whereas there are many reasons to justify this postponement , the most important one , and the only one cited in the american college of surgeons ' monumental recommendation , is on a societal level : to preserve essential supplies , such as ventilators , for the avalanche of patients who will overwhelm resources in the predictable future . \n\n objections against such an unprecedented recommendation is perhaps equally predictable . indeed , our data indicated that hospitals staffed by private-practice neurosurgeons were less likely than non-profit hospitals to mandate expansive cancelation of elective cases in the weeks following the acs recommendation . and predictably , neurosurgeons working in the `` for-profit '' setting were also less likely to be in favor of broadly shutting down surgeries . \n\n in the rapidly changing circumstances of the pandemic , only days after the acs issued its document , other reasons started to emerge , justifications for postponement which are more on a personal level . as the case numbers surged , hospitals quickly became `` breeding grounds '' for the sars-cov-2 virus even as social distancing mitigated its spread elsewhere in society . when the center of medicare and medicaid services issued its recommendation , `` limiting exposure of patients to the ... virus '' was cited in the first paragraph as a means to `` aggressively address covid-19 '' . \n\n as personal protective equipment ran scarce , the preservation of hospital staff quickly become another strong reason to defer non-emergent procedures . in their warning about endonasal surgeries during the pandemic , the `` stanford protocol '' cited a report from wuhan , china in which multiple members ( > 14 ) in and around a transphenoidal procedure became infected , thought to be due to high viral shedding from the nasal and oropharyngeal cavity . \n\n taken together , postponing elective surgeries is not only a reasonable strategy , it seems to be the only rational path for neurosurgeons until the end of the pandemic . the data from our us respondents indicated that even within the short 2 weeks of the principal study , the date of the response was a positive predictor of both the hospitals ' response and neurosurgeons ' opinion towards more stringent shutdown . \n\n what cases to postpone \n\n having trained for decades to earn the privilege to operate , more likely to `` run towards the fire '' than away from it , and always preferring action over being idle , any neurosurgeon is likely to be unfamiliar and uncomfortable with that idea that postponing her or his work is beneficial to society . when solving a neurosurgical problem means the possibility of deadly infection for both patient and staff , the risk/benefit calculation has become completely foreign . to help define what constitutes a legitimate procedure that should be done despite the pandemic , several institutions have published categories of procedures to be considered `` emergent . '' but neurosurgeons are trained to recognize emergencies , and our data reflected that the strongest agreement among our respondents was on the 2 case scenarios with highest risk and urgency scores ( i.e . giant aneurysm and cerebellar metastasis , table 2 q7 , q3 ) . in fact , for emergent , life-preserving cases , the trickier question is which to defer , as surgeons became increasingly concerned that some operations may create ventilator-dependent patients without meaningful recovery , unfortunate always , but unjustifiable when resources are scarce during the pandemic . \n\n regarding non-emergent operations , the acs document which started the elective case shutdown in the usa was amended to include an `` elective surgery acuity scale , '' meant as a guideline to re-schedule cases . despite thorough searches , we were unable to locate the scale in any published studies , and moreover , the application of the scale to neurosurgery is questionable since a single , massively-broad description , `` neurosurgery , '' was placed in `` tier 3a : do not postpone . '' the eans published an `` adapted elective surgery acuity scale '' which is more helpful , but even in this , procedures are grouped in a large disease categories such as `` unruptured aneurysm , '' which incidentally is in tier 2 `` postpone if possible . '' since not all unruptured aneurysms are alike , there remains a vast amount of ambiguity . applying this scale to our 9 scenarios , the c45 stenosis case in our study , in 6th place in the acuity rank per our respondents ( table 5 ) , would have been placed in tier 1 and postponed indefinitely , whereas the pituitary adenoma and vestibular schwannoma , in the 7th and 9th ranks , would have been placed in tier 2 and gone ahead of it . the giant aneurysm , in the 2nd position in our acuity rank just behind the cerebellar metastasis , would have been in tier 2 and postponed for treatment , while the avm , in the 8th position , would also be in tier 2 indistinguishable from the aneurysm . \n\n a strategic scheme is perhaps more useful . if the line of thinking can follow a logical progression , it can then be applied to any case with nuanced , yet critical clinical information , neglected in broad categorizations . we examined the way our respondents ranked the 9 hypothetical scenarios in this study and `` reverse engineered '' a strategic scheme that would duplicate that ranking . there are two orthogonal axes that make up this scheme , two lines of thinking that intersect . in the first , one considers the next adverse event that is likely to occur during postponement of surgery , and this is the risk that was assessed in principal phase . whether the adverse event occurs through disease progression or pure chance is not as important as the severity of the consequence , which we rank from `` significant focal neurological deficit , '' to `` severe focal neurological deficit , '' to `` coma , '' and then `` death . '' the other line of thinking involves time , and this was assessed in the supplemental phase . does the next predictable adverse event have a 50/50 chance of occurring in 2 days , 1 week , 2 weeks , 1 month , or 2 months ? \n\n a proposed strategic scheme . the scheme consists of two orthogonal lines of thinking , one related to the next predictable adverse event ( either from disease progression or by chance ) , and the other related to the timing of this event . the nine case scenarios , a-i , are plotted onto the field according to the average `` risk score '' and `` urgency score '' generated from our study ( table 5 ) . numbers in field : estimated acuity index \n\n using the cerebellar metastasis case as an example , the next adverse event is likely hydrocephalus from disease progression , leading possibly to coma . this event may not happen in 2 days ' time , but there may well be a 50/50 chance of it happening within 1 week . with this `` educated guess , '' one can place a marker under `` 3 '' on the horizontal axis and next to `` 4 '' on the vertical on fig . 3 . this position is in very close proximity to `` a , '' where our study data positioned the same case . one can apply these two lines of thinking to any clinical scenario and place the result as a marker on fig . 3 . if the marker lands in blue , then the procedure can reasonably be postponed until the end of the pandemic . if red , the operation should probably happen soon . a marker in purple denotes a case that can be postponed until hospital resources , as well as personnel and patient safety are reasonably assured . since trauma procedures have dropped significantly as a side-effect of social distancing , it not unreasonable to believe that when `` flattening the curve '' finally happens , some of the cases landing the purple zone can proceed before they turn into emergencies . \n\n limitations of the study \n\n while the use of social media allows for rapid dissemination and collection of data , there are distinct challenges controlling for who takes the survey . to help overcome these limitations , private social media networks were utilized specifically targeting international neurosurgeons to participate in the surveys . as with all studies involving surveys from volunteers , selection bias is hard to avoid and may not necessarily represent majority opinions of every neurosurgeon around the world . as polling does for elections , this study only `` spot checks '' the opinions of neurosurgeons and their practice conditions . \n\n among the respondents , the proportion of early-career neurosurgeons was greater than those with more experience . it is likely that some respondents interpreted the `` years in neurosurgery '' question to mean post-training , even though the survey was meant to include trainees . fortunately , as pointed out in the results section , excluding neurosurgeons who reported `` 0-8 years '' in the field did not alter the scores significantly . \n\n since the two-part survey was conducted anonymously and an email identifier was voluntary , only 166 respondents could be verified as completing both phases . the other respondents may or may not be the same surgeons in both phases , but the cumulative responses , in aggregate , would reflect the impact of the virus pandemic on current neurosurgical practices . \n\n the hypothetical cases selected may not realistically reflect what every survey respondent regularly manages within their scope of practice . similarly , it is impossible to quantify the respective expertise of each neurosurgeon respondent , which may also contribute to study bias . however , we specifically avoided asking a panel of `` experts '' to adjudicate our scenarios , as this would create an artificial setting unrealistic in the `` real world , '' where neurosurgeons make daily decisions without expert advice . we could have asked our respondents to rank the acuity of the 9 scenarios to save a step in the study . instead , we chose to ask them about the risk of postponement and the urgency to re-schedule because these questions are more realistic . routinely , neurosurgeons made decisions on individual clinical scenarios , and triaging nine cases at once seemed artificial . \n\n conclusion \n\n the covid-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on healthcare systems worldwide . to care for the massive numbers of covid patients , many hospital systems and surgeons are focused on conserving resources by limiting elective surgical procedures . during this study , conducted during the peak of the pandemic in western europe , we sought to determine how covid-19 has disrupted the practice of neurosurgeons globally and affected the decision-making in triaging neurosurgical cases . a majority of respondents reported that all elective cases and clinics were re-scheduled . government policy for strict social distancing and higher number of covid-19 cases were predictors of hospital policy and neurosurgeons ' views on canceling cases , while `` for-profit '' practices and neurosurgeons in lmic were less likely to experience strict hospital mandates for postponement . the survey responses to non-emergent case scenarios were used to develop an acuity index , which indicated that neuro-oncology cases , as well as select vascular cases , have high acuity . a strategic scheme was created as a possible guideline for sensible triaging of non-emergent neurosurgical cases , so that global neurosurgeons can continue to serve their patients without harming them either neurologically through delaying surgery , or by unnecessarily exposing them to the deadly virus at the pinnacle of the covid tide . \n\n electronic

00111000	public health might be endangered by possible prolonged discharge of sars-cov-2 in stool \n\n highlights \n\n the published data , which showed the covid-19 patients with low digestive . \n\n manifestation , might be misleading . case with negative urt test showed positive in . \n\n rectal scarab which challenge the isolation protocol . \n\n as fomite transmission caused clusters of infection of sars , adequate disinfection . \n\n operations should be adopted in sars-cov-2 outbreak . \n\n dear editor , \n\n according to a recent report , since december 8 2019 , a novel identified coronavirus , sars-cov-2 ( previously named as 2019-ncov ) is causing outbreak of pneumonia in wuhan , china and become the major concern throughout the world . the world health organization has recently announced this disease to constitute a public health emergency of international concern and then named this disease as corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) . by the 28 feb , 2020 , more than 80,000 confirmed cases including over 2500 death cases were officially announced . till now , the infection control and surveillance focus on respiratory system . the ignorance of sars-cov-2 in digestive system may cause troubles in the disease control . \n\n items covid-19 covid-19 covid-19 sars journal lancet lancet jama lancet cases 41 99 138 1425 published data 2020/1/24 2020/1/29 2020/2/7 2003/3/24 fever ( % ) 98 83 98.6 94 cough ( % ) 76 82 82 50.4 shortness of breath ( % ) 55 31 31.2 30.6 sputum production ( % ) 28 na 26.8 27.8 diarrhea ( % ) 3 2 10.1 27 death ( % ) 15 11 4.3 < 60 years old : 13 2 % . > 60 years old : 43.3 % \n\n presenting clinical features in covid-19 series and sars . \n\n table 1 \n\n covid-19 : corona virus disease 2019 ; sars : severe acute respiratory syndrome . \n\n gastrointestinal symptoms seem to be uncommon in patients with covid-19 when compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) ( table 1 ) . however , they should not be ignored as the increasing rate of diarrhea occurs in confirmed covid-19 patients according to a recent report that 14 of 138 confirmed patients had diarrhea . those early reports may not represent actual rate of gastrointestinal symptoms caused by sars-cov-2 , because in early stages of the outbreak , the limited resources for detection were only provided to those patients with severe symptoms like respiratory distress syndrome . about 27 percent of sars patients have diarrhea and since full-length genome sequences identified that sars-cov-2 is 79.5 % identical to sars-cov and share the same receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) , it is estimated that rate of gastrointestinal symptoms would be higher in patients with covid-19 . \n\n one possible route for the movement of sars-cov-2 into digestive system may be `` trachea-esophagus-ileum-colon '' as single-cell transcriptom analysis showed ace2 , the entry receptor for sars-cov-2 , highly expressed in lung at2 cells , esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells and enterocytes from ileum and colon . the evidence for this route is that all of the specimens including pharyngeal swab , esophageal biopsy , gastric mucosa , rectal mucosa , duodenal mucosa and stool tested positive to sars-cov-2 in two cases . another route may be bloodstream infection since sars-cov-2 was directly detected in bleeding site in one case . in addition , expression of ace2 in endothelial cells and macrophages , as well as the detection of sars-cov in plasma and blood lymphocytes also support the possibility of bloodstream infection of sars-cov-2 . \n\n the discharge guideline depending on respiratory tract test also meets challenge . in cases , sars-cov-2 infected infant initially behaved as vomiting , diarrhea or feeding intolerance . interestingly , while the virus test of nasopharyngeal swab switched from positive to negative after treatment , the rectal swab specimens still tested positive . these cases remind the clinicians that the rectal swab may be equally important to the pharyngeal swab even the patient is asymptomatic which challenge the latest published guideline provided by national health commission of china that two successive negative of the respiratory tract tests are regarded as the standard for discharge and termination of compulsory isolation for covid-19 patients . \n\n a famous well-described clusters of infection of sars in amoy gardens , hong kong drew the attention of health official on fomite transmission because two thirds of the confirmed sars patients in this amoy gardens had diarrhea . as findings showed that patients with sars could discharge sars-cov in their stool up to 73 days after symptom onset , the stools with the virus became the resource of contamination of airdrops and a variety of environmental surfaces , which may contribute to the clusters of infection . similarly , evidence showed that sars-cov-2 were identified in 4 stool specimens ( 4 out of 62 ) , so fomite transmission should not be ignored in the transmission of sars-cov-2 since the virus may move from respiratory tract in to gastrointestinal tract the recovered patients may discharge the stool with virus for a long time . \n\n according to a recent published report by cdc of china , the community acquired infections are becoming the predominant route in transmission . based on these cases and the lessons from sars , we recommend 1 ) the attentions should be drawn in digestive symptoms and stool or rectal scwrab tests for patients with suspicion or confirmed sars-cov-2 infection , 2 ) preventive education and publicity on hands washing and bathroom infection , 3 ) compulsory isolation till scwrab tests switch to negative , 4 ) surveillance and adequate disinfection in latrines in areas with seversars-cov-2 infection to avoid fomite transmission . \n\n declaration of competing interest \n\n the authors declare no conflicts of interest . \n\n references \n\n emergence of a novel coronavirus causing respiratory illness from wuhan , china \n\n clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in wuhan , china \n\n epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in wuhan , china : a descriptive study \n\n clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in wuhan , china \n\n epidemiological determinants of spread of causal agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome in hong kong \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n wang , h. detection and monitoring of sars coronavirus in the plasma and peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome . clin . chem . 2004 ;

00001000	covid-19 : peer support and crisis communication strategies to promote institutional resilience \n\n caring for patients with the novel coronavirus infection is placing great stress on health care systems and health care workers . on the basis of their experiences responding to other pandemics , the authors summarize lessons learned and offer some best practices for facilitating organizational resilience and supporting health care workers during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n an infectious disease physician in milan described his work caring for patients with the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) : \n\n it is an impossible-to-understand situation , with people intubated in the hall , not enough ventilators , ethical decisions regarding who to intubate , shortage of masks and gloves , confusion and exhaustion . hell is probably like this . i have no time to understand , to think about and to express emotions . \n\n novel coronavirus disease is posing an extraordinary challenge to the health and well-being of persons across the globe . along with grave threats to social stability , economic prosperity , and human health , caring for patients places great stress on health care workers ( hcws ) . because care of the patient depends on providers who are physically and mentally fit , the integrity of the health care system and its capacity to take adequate care of patients are at stake . the authors have had experience responding to severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) and h1n1 influenza , formulating a national medical recovery plan in kuwait , responding to the 9/11 world trade center disaster , and developing peer support programs for health care . in this commentary , we summarize lessons learned from those experiences and provide consensus on best practices for fostering an organizational culture of resilience . \n\n health care workers caring for patients with contagious , life-threatening illnesses , such as covid-19 , are likely to have anxiety and fear of being infected . in the case of sars , up to 50 % of hcws had acute psychological distress , burnout , and posttraumatic stress while caring for these patients . fear of contagion and of infecting family members , social isolation , and additional stressors contributed to adverse outcomes . the stress of prolonged exposure to covid-19 and the need to support clinicians have been noted in recent publications . \n\n we have observed similar responses to covid-19 in our hcws , especially among those with a high risk for exposure to infectious material , such as workers in biocontainment units and emergency departments . shortages of personal protective equipment may provoke anger , frustration , and helplessness . nonprofessional staff and those working in less visible parts of the hospital , such as laundry and facilities , receive less information , making them feel isolated and disempowered . staff also must contend with sometimes daily shifts in policy , fear of contagion , and added work , as well as obligations to family and others outside the hospital . if staff are unsupported , covid-19-related trauma may cause symptoms of distress and burnout and decrease their ability to function effectively . these symptoms may evolve into posttraumatic stress disorder or other chronic conditions . feeling out of control and unappreciated increases the number of people calling out of work . in the case of sars , perceived adequacy of preparatory training and support mitigated long-term adverse outcomes . this calls for health care organizations to support the mental health of hcws . \n\n we recommend 3 strategic principles that may be of value for other health care institutions responding to the covid-19 pandemic : first , provide leadership focused on resilience . effective crisis management provides a clear , optimistic vision and realistic plan ; takes decisive action ; and facilitates open , honest , and frequent communication . leaders should make extra efforts to thank workers and express gratitude for the extra burden being imposed on them . \n\n second , structure crisis communications to provide information and empowerment . in the absence of information , imagination and worst-case scenarios rush in . information can help to reduce anxiety . leadership should provide the most up-to-date information on covid-19 , what is being done to protect hcws , and what they should do if exposed . leadership should anticipate questions and answer them in advance . to restore a sense of control , they should empower workers by providing them with information about what they can do to help themselves . \n\n third , create a continuum of staff support within the organization . leaders should anticipate a surge of mental health concerns among hcws at all levels . they should normalize these feelings and encourage their expression , advocate personal wellness , and identify support resources . they should create a peer support team to provide psychological first aid , potentially by tapping into existing employee assistance , chaplaincy , or other wellness programs , with triage when needed to higher levels of support . \n\n at johns hopkins medicine , a unified command center was activated soon after the world health organization declared covid-19 `` a public health emergency of international concern . '' we know that if workers feel they will be supported in a disaster , they will be more resilient ; therefore , staff support has been included alongside other essential services , such as infection control and supply chain management . \n\n johns hopkins has a confidential peer support program called rise ( resilience in stressful events ) . rise responds to calls 24/7 and provides in-person psychological first aid and emotional support to hcws who experience stressful clinical events , such as an unexpected complication or the death of a patient . in the past 5 years , the program has been replicated in more than 30 u.s. hospitals and has helped thousands of workers . \n\n for the covid-19 response , rise is coordinating with employee assistance and hospital wellness programs , chaplains , and psychiatrists . team members round proactively on high-acuity units , while also responding in person to pages from individuals and groups and offering immediate phone support to callers . attention is given to less visible units , such as the microbiology laboratory , transport , and pharmacy . a useful strategy has been pairing infection control personnel to provide updates with rise responders to give emotional support . support efforts will increase if allocation of scarce life-sustaining medical resources becomes necessary . rise also monitors the command center , where senior leaders and staff work lengthy shifts . \n\n response to the covid-19 pandemic is a marathon , not a sprint . leaders and managers of health care organizations should be forewarned to pace themselves and their responses . when disaster strikes , the emotional response generally occurs in phases . much of the u.s. health care response is still in the early impact and heroic phases . however , planning should begin for a longer , disillusionment phase during which emotional needs among hcws will grow . \n\n in summary , we describe an approach to enhance the well-being and resilience of hcws in response to the covid-19 pandemic . our recommendations are based on our observations of hcw stress during the sars outbreak and institutional experience with delivering peer support . this approach has the potential to enhance organizational cohesion and reduce adverse effects for hcws . \n\n this article was published at annals.org on 6 april 2020 . \n\n references \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 
10100000	epidemiological , clinical characteristics of cases of sars-cov-2 infection with abnormal imaging findings . \n\n purpose : to investigate the epidemiological , clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients with abnormal imaging findings . methods : patients confirmed with sars-cov-2 infection of zhejiang province from jan 17 to feb 8 underwent ct or x-ray were enrolled . epidemiological , clinical data were analyzed between those with abnormal or normal imaging findings . results : excluding 72 patients with normal images , 230 of 573 patients affected more than two lobes . the median radiograph score was 2.0 and there 's negative correlation between the score and oxygenation index ( rho=-0.657 , p < 0.001 ) . patients with abnormal images were older ( 46.65 +- 13.82 ) , with higher rate of coexisting condition ( 28.8 % ) , lower rate of exposure history and longer time between onset and confirmation ( 5d ) than non-pneumonia patients ( all p < 0.05 ) . higher rate of fever , cough , expectoration , and headache , lower lymphocytes , albumin , serum sodium levels and higher total bilirubin , creatine kinase , lactate dehydrogenase and c-reactive protein levels and lower oxygenation index were observed in pneumonia patients ( all p < 0.05 ) . muscle ache , shortness of breath , nausea and vomiting , lower lymphocytes levels and higher serum creatinine and radiograph score at admission were predictive factors for severe/critical subtype . conclusion : patients with abnormal images have more obvious clinical manifestations and laboratory changes . combing clinical features and radiograph score can effectively predict severe/critical type . 
00110000	bayesian phylodynamic inference on the temporal evolution and global transmission of sars-cov-2 \n\n dear editor , \n\n severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) has developed a global pandemic . the initial transmission of sars-cov-2 has been limited in the national wide of china during the first two month , while a global spread is establishing with about 2 million laboratory confirmed infections and more than 126 , 000 deaths from 185 countries by april 15 , 2020 . \n\n the genome of sars-cov-2 exhibited a relative high similarity among the early obtained strains . however , two key mutations were recently identified , potentially contributing to the sub-lineage classification of sars-cov-2 . although the genome structure of sars-cov-2 has been well documented , the temporal evolution and global transmission of the virus remains poorly investigated . \n\n here , we retrieved 313 sras-cov-2 genomes from the gisaid ( www.gisaid.org ) database , from which 99 genomes with exact collection dates ( before feb 29 , 2019 ) were selected to infer the origin time and global transmission of sars-cov-2 by bayesian phylodynamic approaches . \n\n to gain insight into the temporal evolutionary dynamics of sars-cov-2 , we performed markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithms implemented in beast 1.10.4 package with the 99 enrolled sars-cov-2 genomes . generalized time reversible ( gtr ) with invariant sites as site heterogeneity model ( gtr+i ) was selected as the best-fit nucleotide substitution model by the akaike information criterion ( aic ) implemented in jmodeltest . the estimated mean evolutionary rate of sars-cov-2 was estimated to be 6.14 x 10-6 subs/site/day ( 95 % hpd : 3.61 x 10-6 -8.68 x 10-6 subs/site/day ) , corresponding to 2.24 x 10-3 subs/site/year ( 95 % hpd : 1.32 x 10-3 -3.17 x 10-3 subs/site/year ) . \n\n bayesian evolutionary dynamics of sars-cov-2 . ( a ) time-scaled maximum clade credibility ( mcc ) tree based on mcmc analysis of the 99 sars-cov-2 genomes with an exponential growth tree prior . the time scale was set to the bottom of fig . 1 shared by both ( a ) and ( b ) . the tree branches were colored according to the collection countries with the color panel to the left lower part . time to the most common recent ancestor ( tmrca ) and the divergence time of clades and sub-clades were labelled on the corresponding nodes with 95 % hpd in the following bracket . clade and sub-clade specific mutations were labelled under the divergent time , with the non-synonymous mutations labelled in red . ( b ) population dynamics of sars-cov-2 . the viral population dynamics was represented by the viral relative genetic diversity generated from bayesian skyline plot reconstruction of the mcmc analysis . the y-axis represents relative genetic diversity , which is equivalent to the product of the effective population size ( ne ) and the generation length in days ( tau ) . the color regions show 95 % hpd limits , and the black line represent the median estimate of relative genetic diversity . \n\n fig . 1 \n\n we recorded the information of mcmc reconstruction into a maximum clade credibility ( mcc ) tree by using the program treeannotator . from the mcc tree ( fig . 1 ) , the tmrca ( time to the most common recent ancestor ) of sars-cov-2 was dated back to dec 11 , 2019 ( 95 % hpd , nov 21 , 2019 - dec 24 , 2019 ) . two major clades were observed from the mcc tree , with a divergence time at dec 23 , 2019 ( 95 % hpd , dec 18 , 2019 - dec 29 , 2019 ) , both of which consist strains of sars-cov-2 from wuhan and other regions of china . \n\n the circulating strains of sars-cov-2 could be separated into four sub-clades ( fig . 1a ) . the two sub-clades from clade 1 was diverged at jan 1 , 2020 ( 95 % hpd , dec 27 , 2019 - jan 5 , 2020 ) , while the two sub-clades from clade 2 was diverged at jan 8 , 2020 ( 95 % hpd , jan 3 - jan 13 ) . with respect to the country-specific strains of sars-cov-2 , we observed that the circulating strains in usa were from both of the two clades , the uk and australia circulating strains were from clade 1 , the circulating strains in singapore , japan , germany , france and italy seemed to be from clade 2 ( fig . 1a , table s1 ) . \n\n to infer the population growth dynamics of sars-cov-2 , the viral relative genetic diversity was reconstructed by bayesian skyline plot ( bsp ) analysis . bsp analysis suggested that sars-cov-2 possessed a relative stable effective population size ( ne ) during the first month ( dec 23 , 2019 to jan 22 , 2020 ) of the virus outbreak ( fig . 1b ) . a slow but accelerating reduction in the ne was observed from jan 22 , 2020 , with a sharp reduction of the lower 95 % hpd of the ne from feb 5 , 2020 . a sharp reduction in the ne suggests the initiation of a bottle-neck-effect in the virus population size . a bottle-neck-effect indicates that the current circulating virus strain was trapped , and more mutations in the virus genome will potentially occur to help the virus escape , resulting in a leap in the virus population . despite the bsp was generated from a limited sample size , the results suggested a possible initiation of a bottle-neck-effect in the population size of sars-cov-2 , indicating more infected cases will occur in the near future due to the increased mutations in the viral genome . \n\n despite sars-cov-2 remains relative stable , thirteen clade/sub-clade-specific mutations were observed in the present study ( fig . 1a ) . the mutations at nt 8782 and nt 28,144 were clade specific , i.e. , c8782t and t28144c were only occurred in clade 1 , rather than in clade 2 . only a viral strain ( epi_isl_406,592 from guangdong , china ) in clade 1 did not possess c8782t , while all strains in clade 1 possess t28144c . eleven out of the thirteen sub-clade specific mutations were also observed ( fig . 1a ) . seven mutations were located in clade 1 , among which c29095g and c24034t/t26729c were observed in a sub-clade consisting of viral strains from china ( outside wuhan ) and usa , respectively . g28878aand g29742a were observed in a subclade of viral strains from australia and usa . four mutations were located in clade 2 , among which c21707t and c28854t were observed in a sub-clade consisting of viral strains from china ( outside wuhan ) and usa . c17373t was observed in a sub-clade of viral strains from china ( outside wuhan ) , usa and singapore . g26144t was observed in a sub-clade of viral strains from usa , taiwan , australia , sweden , italy , and singapore . \n\n mutation gene type amino acid mutation collection country/region of the viral strain c8782t orf1a synonymous - clade 1 in fig . 1a ( detailed in table s1 ) c17373t orf1b synonymous - china ( outside wuhan ) , usa and singapore c18060t orf1b synonymous - china ( outside wuhan ) and usa c24034t s synonymous - t26729c m synonymous - c29095g n synonymous - t18488c orf1b non-synonymous ile-thr united kingdom c21707t s non-synonymous his-tyr china ( outside wuhan ) and usa g26144t orf3 non-synonymous gly-val usa , taiwan , australia , sweden , italy , and singapore t28144c orf8 non-synonymous leu-ser clade 1 in fig . 1a ( detailed in table s1 ) c28854t n non-synonymous ser-phe china ( outside wuhan ) and usa g28878a n non-synonymous ser-asn australia and usa g29742a 3-utr non-synonymous arg-his ( untranslated ) \n\n clade-/sub-clade specific mutations of sars-cov-2 observed in maximum clade credibility tree . \n\n table 1 \n\n ile , isoleucine ;

00000100	dynamic change process of target genes by rt-pcr testing of sars-cov-2 during the course of a coronavirus disease 2019 patient \n\n we report the dynamic change process of target genes by rt-pcr testing of sars-cov-2 during the course of a covid-19 patient : from successive negative results to successive single positive nucleocapsid gene , to two positive target genes ( orf1ab and nucleocapsid ) by rt-pcr testing of sars-cov-2 , and describe the diagnosis , clinical course , and management of the case . in this case , negative results of rt-pcr testing was not excluded to diagnose a suspected covid-19 patient , clinical signs and symptoms , other laboratory findings , and chest ct images should be taken into account for the absence of enough positive evidence . this case highlights the importance of successive sampling and testing sars-cov-2 by rt-pcr as well as the increased value of single positive target gene from pending to positive in two specimens to diagnose laboratory-confirmed covid-19 . \n\n introduction \n\n in december 2019 , a cluster of cases of pneumonia causing by unknown virus were reported in wuhan , hubei province , china , origin of the virus was traced back to huanan seafood wholesale market in wuhan . on january 7 , 2020 , chinese health authorities confirmed that this cluster was associated with a novel coronavirus , 2019-ncov . the virus was subsequently renamed sars-cov-2 as it is similar to the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars-cov ) , a member of the subgenus sarbecovirus ( beta-cov lineage b ) , with which it shares more than 79 % of its sequence . coronaviruses ( covs ) are single-stranded rna viruses which belong to order nidovirales , family coronaviridae , subfamily coronavirinae , and have been classified into four major groups : alpha-covs , beta-covs , gamma-covs and delta-covs . sars-cov-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect humans , after 229e , nl63 , oc43 , hku1 , mers-cov , and the original sars-cov . the whole genome sequence of wuhan new virus ( wh-human_1 ) was first released on jan 10 , 2020 . five typical orfs were identified on one complete sars-cov-2 genome ( 29870-bp , excluding the poly ( a ) tail ) in genbank ( accession number mn908947 ) , including orf1ab polyprotein ( 7096-aa ) , spike glycoprotein ( 1273-aa ) , envelope protein ( 75-aa ) , membrane protein ( 222-aa ) , and nucleocapsid protein ( 419-aa ) . coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) caused epidemic in china , as well as infection cases worldwide . this report describes diagnostic process of a covid-19 patient from successive negative results to successive single positive nucleocapsid gene , then to two positive target genes ( orf1ab and nucleocapsid ) by rt-pcr testing . the case provides an example for diagnosing suspected covid-19 , despite successive negative results of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( rt-pcr ) testing in the early stages . successive sampling and testing sars-cov-2 by rt-pcr as well as clinical signs and symptoms , other laboratory findings , and chest ct images , should be taken into account for the absence of enough positive evidence . \n\n case report \n\n date jan. 18 jan. 22 jan. 23 jan. 25 jan. 26 jan. 28 jan. 30 jan. 31 feb. 1 feb. 2 feb. 4 feb. 5 feb. 7 feb. 8 feb. 10 feb. 11 feb. 12 feb.

presented to fever clinic in ningbo first hospital , zhejiang province , china , with a 6-day history of subjective fever and cough , and was admitted in respiratory ward in this hospital , diagnosed with pneumonia ( admission day 0 ) . he disclosed that he had dinner with friends in the restaurant in ningbo on january 14 . he and his friends had no tour history to wuhan , the epidemic focus of covid-19 outbreak in china . after dinner , he visited ningbo haishu third hospital for drunkenness , nausea , and vomiting ( details not available ) . he had a fever three days later , and the highest temperature was up to 38.5 c. on january 18 , he presented to the emergency in ningbo first hospital , with cough , chills , headache dizziness , and muscle ache , but without expectoration , stuffy nose and running nose , chest distress and chest pain . routine blood test revealed lymphocytopenia ( table 1 ) . the empiric therapy were administrated with levofloxacin , cefuroxime axetil and aloxicillin ( details not available ) . he still had a fever and visited ningbo haishu third hospital on january 22 . c-reactive protein increased to 8.50 mg/l , antigen test for influenza a and b was negative , chest ct images showed evidence of pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung . \n\n after admission , the physical examination revealed a body temperature of 38.4 c , blood pressure of 151/80 mm hg , respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute , and oxygen saturation of 95 % while the patient was breathing ambient air . lung auscultation revealed rough breath sounds and a few moist rales in both lungs . the patient reported a few dry cough , and received moxifloxacin ( 0.4 g qd , ivgtt ) . he has no previous history of hypertension , without antihypertensive treatment , blood pressure reduced to 105/68 mm hg from the next day and remained stable . \n\n given the patient 's recurrent fevers , other laboratory testing was performed , but results revealed no abnormalities , including rt-pcr testing for influenza a rna , blood cultures , sputum cultures , sputum smear for acid fast bacillus , tumor markers ( cea , afp , psa , ca125 , ca199 ) , blood biochemistry ( hepatic function , renal function , myocardial enzyme spectrum , thyroid function , glucose , fat , electrolyte ) , coagulation function , d-d dimer , routine urine and stool test , erythrocyte sedimentation rate , specific antibody of syphilis , human immunodeficiency virus , hepatitis b virus , hepatitis c virus and rheumatism . chest ct images on day 2 showed evidence of pneumonia in the bilateral lower lobes . given high temperature of 38.5 c persisted , methylprednisolone ( 40 mg qd , ivgtt ) was administrated on day 4 , and the patient was afebrile afterwards . after discontinuation of 3 days of methylprednisolone course , the patient was febrile again , the highest temperature was up to 38.9 c . \n\n although patients and their relatives denied the tour history to the outbreak areas , and denied the contact history with persons traveled from the outbreak areas , sars-cov-2 nucleic acid were tested by rt-pcr ( novel coronavirus pcr fluorescence diagnostic kit , shanghai geneodx biotech ) . results of rt-pcr testing using oropharyngeal swab specimens were negative on day 3 and day 8 , pending on day 9 and day 10 , positive on day 16 , and negative on day 19 and day 20 . \n\n given the pending result of rt-pcr testing ( single positive nucleocapsid gene ) on day 9 , combining deteriorating chest ct images on day 7 that infiltrates appeared in the lower lobe of the right lung and bilateral upper lobes , the patient was suspected as a covid-19 patient , and transferred to the isolation ward to receive antiviral treatment : arbidol tablets ( 0.2 g tid , p.o ) , lopinavir and ritonavir tablets ( 0.5 g bid , p.o ) , lianhua qingwen capsules ( 1.4 g tid , p.o ) . routine blood test and c-reactive protein revealed secondary bacterial infection , moxifloxacin ( 0.4 g qd , ivgtt ) was administrated . \n\n on day 10 , the patient is afebrile , but felt nausea , especially after the medicine . to confirm the pending result , oropharyngeal swab specimen was collected for rt-pcr testing and reported another pending result ( single positive nucleocapsid gene ) again . deep sputum specimen was also collected after atomization with hypertonic saline for rt-pcr testing , and reported negative . treatment plan unchanged . \n\n on day 12 , the patient 's clinical condition , routine blood test , and c-reactive protein improved , administration of moxifloxacin was discontinued . chest ct images on day 13 showed infiltrates in the upper lung lobes increased , the lower lobe of the left lung was consolidated , and dense consolidations in bilateral lower lobes were partially absorbed . on day 16 , oropharyngeal swabs for rt-pcr testing was reported positive . \n\n the patient 's clinical condition improved . he reported no fever from day 10 , and no cough from day 22 . chest ct images on day 18 and day 22 showed dense consolidations in bilateral lungs absorbed more than before , results of rt-pcr testing of oropharyngeal swab specimens were negative on day 19 and day 20 , all symptoms had resolved , the patient was discharged on february 15 ( day 23 ) , and sent to ningbo haishu second hospital for other 14 days . on february 20 , 23 , 26 , the patient was sent to ningbo first hospital to undergo evaluation by a provider , and reported no symptom . oropharyngeal swab specimens were collected for rt-pcr testing and were reported negative every time . \n\n methods \n\n specimen collection \n\n clinical specimens for sars-cov-2 diagnostic testing were obtained in accordance with chinese guidelines . oropharyngeal swab and anal swab specimens were collected with synthetic fiber swabs , each swab was inserted into a separate sterile tube containing 2 to 3 ml of viral transport medium . deep sputum specimen was collected after atomization of hypertonic saline , and into a sterile tube containing transport medium . specimens were stored between 2 c and 8 c until ready for shipment to the department of laboratory medicine in ningbo first hospital . \n\n diagnostic testing for sars-cov-2 \n\n nucleic acid extraction was magnetic bead method . clinical specimens were tested with rt-pcr assay ( novel coronavirus pcr fluorescence diagnostic kit , shanghai geneodx biotech ) . the thermal cycle parameters of rt-pcr amplification were as follows : 42 c 5 min for reverse transcription , 95 c 30 s for pre- denaturation , then 40 cycles of pcr ( 95 c 10 s , 60 c 45 s ) . rt-pcr assay was performed on a applied biosystems 7500 sequence detection system ( abi , u.s.a ) . sequences of primers and fluorescent probe are available from chinese guidelines . sample with cycle threshold ( ct ) value < 37 was assessed as positive , sample with 37 < = ct value < 40 as gray zone which required retest , sample with no ct value or ct value = 40 as negative . \n\n the nucleic acid determination of sars-cov-2 is aimed at two target genes : open reading frame 1ab ( orf1ab ) and nucleocapsid gene . positive result of rt-pcr testing is determined by two positive target genes in the same specimen . result of single positive gene is assessed as pending , and the result of two negative genes is assessed as negative . if only a single positive gene was tested , it needs to be resampled and retested . however , the criterion of single positive gene was amended in the fifth edition guidelines : if only a single positive gene was tested in two specimens , it can be determined as positive testing of sars-cov-2 . \n\n diagnostic criterion for covid-19 \n\n a confirmed covid-19 case is determined by positive result of rt-pcr testing of sars-cov-2 , or by genome sequencing . \n\n results \n\n rt-pcr amplification curve of positive target genes of sars-cov-2 , ct values of positive target of nucleocapsid gene on day 9 ( 1a ) , day 10 ( 1b ) , day 16 ( 1c ) ; ct values of positive target of orf1ab gene ( 1d ) on day 16 . \n\n results of rt-pcr testing using oropharyngeal swab specimens were negative on day 3 and day 8 , pending on day 9 and day 10 , positive on day 16 ( fig . 1 ) , and negative on day 19 and day 20 . after discharge , results of rt-pcr testing using oropharyngeal swab specimens on february 20 , 23 , 26 were all negative . \n\n results using deep sputum specimen on day 10 , and anal swab specimen on day 12 were negative ( table 1 ) . \n\n discussion \n\n on january 20 , dr. zhong nanshan , an academician of chinese academy of engineering , made it clear that novel coronavirus was contagious and spread through human-to-human transmission . the policy was initiated that fever patients can only visit fever clinic at first . rt-pcr testing is the gold standard to diagnose sars-cov-2 . on january 26 , first batch of four registration certificate of novel coronavirus pcr fluorescence diagnostic kit was issued by the state food and drug administration for the emergency , without a series of clinical trials . \n\n it 's a case in point to explain the amendment for the criterion of single positive gene to diagnose a covid-19 patient , especially samples with low viral load . given successive single positive nucleocapsid gene on day9 and day 10 , we hypothesize that this fluorescent quantitative pcr kit is more sensitive to amplify nucleocapsid gene than orf1ab gene , samples with low viral load might result in single positive nucleocapsid gene . from fig . 1 , ct value of nucleocapsid gene on day 10 ( 31.54 ) was less than it on day 9 ( 32.84 ) , which showed a trend toward increasing levels of virus . on day 16 , two positive target genes ( orf1ab and nucleocapsid ) were tested along with higher viral load . if we comply with the pending criterion of single positive gene in old edition guidelines , diagnosis of a covid-19 patient with low viral load will be delayed or even missed . therefore , it 's advisable to amend the diagnostic criterion of single positive gene . fortunately , we treated this case as a covid-19 patient , 20 days before fifth edition guidelines published on february 21 . \n\n the suspected covid-19 can not be hastily excluded by negative results of rt-pcr testing for sars-cov-2 . in this case , therapies for recurrent fevers were ineffective in the early stages , we considered the patient as a covid-19 one , despite negative results of rt-pcr testing on day 3 and day 8 . successive sampling and testing sars-cov-2 by rt-pcr caused results of single positive nucleocapsid gene on day 9 and day 10 , two positive target genes on day 16 . however , false negative factors should be excluded : poor sample quality ; sample collection time ( too early or too late ) ; incorrect storage , transportation and handling ; virus mutation , pcr inhibition and so on . single positive nucleocapsid gene was reported on day9 and day 10 , but deep sputum specimen on day 10 was reported negative , we speculate the negative result might be a false negative for poor sample quality . the sputum specimen was difficult to be collected because of small sputum volume . although by atomization with hypertonic saline , the sputum specimen was very sticky , we speculate the efficiency of nucleic acid extraction was incomplete , and affected the accuracy of the testing result subsequently . therefore , collecting a qualified specimen plays a key role in obtaining a correct result . \n\n although there is no clear evidence of the source of infection , we infer that the patient might be infected with sars-cov-2 during dinner or emergency period in ningbo haishu third hospital for drunkenness on january 14 . he had a fever three days later , we infer that the incubation period might be three days , which is accorded with the median incubation period of 4 days ( interquartile range , 2 to 7 ) . in this case , fever and cough were the patient 's chief complaints , which is accorded with two most common symptoms described in 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 in china : fever ( 43.8 % on admission and 88.7 % during hospitalization ) and cough ( 67.8 % ) . lymphocytopenia and abnormalities on chest ct in the case was also presented in 83.2 % of the 1099 patients and in 86.2 % of the 975 ct scans , respectively . \n\n we observed that on day 9 , single positive nucleocapsid gene was reported at the first time , white cell count , neutrophils proportion ( % ) , and c-reactive protein , increased significantly , but lymphocytopenia showed ( table 1 ) . although secondary bacterial infection was considered , and moxifloxacin administration was effective , but we hypothesize that the virus load increased along with the continuous replication of the virus , then the patient 's immunity was consumed to cause secondary bacterial infection . moreover , secondary bacterial infection accelerated the replication of the virus , even promoted the transfer of the virus from deep part of the lung to the throat . the hypothesis needs further observation and verification , which provides a new way to diagnose highly suspected cases with negative results of rt-pcr testing of sars-cov-2 . \n\n conclusion \n\n this case highlights the importance of successive sampling and testing sars-cov-2 by rt-pcr as well as the increased value of single positive target gene from pending to positive in two specimens to diagnose laboratory-confirmed covid-19 . rt-pcr testing is the gold standard to diagnose sars-cov-2 , but the suspected covid-19 patient can not be hastily excluded by negative results of rt-pcr testing . the patient 's clinical condition , results of routine blood test , c-reactive protein , and chest ct images , should be taken into account if short of enough positive evidence . fever , cough , lymphocytopenia and abnormalities on chest ct were most common features of covid-19 , but these are non-specificity and indistinguishable clinically from other common infectious diseases , particularly during the winter respiratory virus season . finally , wearing masks is an essential measure to prevent transmission of sars-cov-2 . \n\n references \n\n world health organization . novel

01110000	emerging threats from zoonotic coronaviruses-from sars and mers to 2019-ncov \n\n coronaviruses are enveloped rna viruses that are widely detected in mammals and birds , and commonly denoted in etiologies of upper respiratory tract infections in humans . two potentially dangerous zoonotic coronaviruses have emerged in the past two decades . the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) , originating from china , was responsible for the first outbreak that extended from 2002 to 2003 . the second outbreak occurred in 2012 in the middle east and was caused by the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n a new strain of coronavirus , designated as the 2019 novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov ) , emerged during the third outbreak in wuhan , china , at the end of 2019 . symptoms of pneumonia with unknown etiology were reported in several patients . the infection was epidemiologically linked to the huanan seafood market in wuhan . similar to the sars-cov and the mers-cov , bats have been denoted as the likely primary reservoirs of the 2019-ncov based on its similarity to bat coronaviruses . the intermediary reservoir is yet to be denoted . \n\n the pertinent and critical factor for an emerging virus is its pandemic potential . efficient human-to-human transmission is a requirement for large-scale spread of a new virus . the proportion of patients with mild symptoms of illness is another important factor that determines our ability to identify infected individuals and to prevent the spread of virus . identification of transmission chains and subsequent contact tracing are further complicated when several infected individuals remain asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic . \n\n a key factor for efficient human-to-human transmission is the ability of the virus to attach to human cells . coronaviruses use a spike protein for attachment to host cells . apparently , the 2019-ncov uses the same human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor as the sars-cov , whereas the mers-cov used dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( also known as cd26 ) . \n\n efficiency infective dose pandemic potential example efficient low high sars-cov , probably 2019-ncov limited high low mers-cov very limited very high very low avian influenza virus no none none japanese encephalitis virus \n\n efficiency of animal virus-associated human-to-human transmission . \n\n table 1 \n\n sars-cov , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ; 2019-ncov , 2019 novel coronavirus ; mers-cov , middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus . \n\n an efficient human-to-human transmission involves multiples routes of transmission , including droplet transfer , direct contact , and indirect contact . a limited human-to-human transmission may require a high infective dose and a significantly close contact with an infected person as prerequisites ( table 1 ) . \n\n coronavirus sars-cov mers-cov 2019-ncov years of outbreak 2002-2003 2012-present 2019-present primary reservoir bat bat bat intermediary reservoir civet cat camel unknown human-to-human transmission efficient limited possibly efficient pandemic potential yes no yes contained yes no no , efforts ongoing incubation period 2-10 days 2-14 days 1-14 days pneumonia very common common common fatality rate 9.5 % 34.4 % 2-4 % in confirmed cases to date \n\n epidemiological and clinical characteristics of zoonotic coronaviruses . \n\n table 2 \n\n sars-cov , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ; mers-cov , middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ; 2019-ncov , 2019 novel coronavirus . \n\n all three zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks in recent decades are associated with pneumonia in patients with severe illness . available data suggest that the 2019-ncov may be less pathogenic than the mers-cov and sars-cov ( table 2 ) . however , the severity of the disease is not necessarily linked to its transmission efficiency and pandemic potential . a rapidly increasing number of 2019-ncov-infected cases suggests that this virus may be transmitted effectively among humans , and mild illness may be quite common in infected individuals . these two features confer a high pandemic potential to the 2019-ncov ( table 2 ) . \n\n the next important factor to consider for the 2019-ncov outbreak is our ability to contain the spread of this new virus . there was a lag of three months between the commencement of the sars epidemic and the initiation of investigation by healthcare officials in 2003 in china . consequently , the infection spread to approximately 8100 people in 29 countries and resulted in 774 deaths . since mild illness is uncommon in sars infection and infected individuals are easily identifiable , sars could be contained effectively and eradicated without vaccination or effective antiviral therapy . currently , there are a limited number of studies from china that investigate the efficacy and potential of lopinavir/ritonavir ( kaletra ) , a combination of protease inhibitors used to treat and prevent hiv/aids , in the treatment of 2019-ncov infection . other agents , including nucleoside analogues , neuraminidase inhibitors , remdesivir , umifenovir ( arbidol ) , tenofovir disoproxil ( tdf ) , and lamivudine ( 3tc ) , along with several chinese traditional medicines , are reported as viable options for antiviral treatment of human pathogenic coronavirus . clinical efficacy of remdesivir for the treatment of the first us case of pneumonia caused by 2019-ncov was recently reported . however , these data are derived from preliminary stages of studies and are insufficient to support the implementation for clinical use in treatment of 2019-ncov infection . \n\n the severe lack of information during the initial stage of the 2019-ncov outbreak posed challenges to and complicated the containment of the infection in specific limited areas . a higher proportion of mild 2019-ncov infections facilitates rapid spreading of the virus . present efforts for containment may not be completely effective . however , we can hope that these efforts may delay the spread of 2019-ncov , and provide us with sufficient time to develop effective vaccines and antiviral agents against the virus . \n\n declaration of competing interest \n\n the authors declares no conflicts of interest . \n\n references \n\n a novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in china , 2019 \n\n early transmission dynamics in wuhan , china , of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia \n\n characteristics of community-acquired respiratory viruses infections except seasonal influenza in transplant recipients and non-transplant critically ill patients \n\n middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) infection during pregnancy : report of two cases & review of the literature \n\n a novel coronavirus emerging in china : key questions for impact assessment \n\n clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in wuhan , china \n\n another decade , another coronavirus \n\n sars : chronology of the epidemic \n\n dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is a functional receptor for the emerging human coronavirus-emc \n\n what we have learnt from sars epidemics in china \n\n drug treatment options for the 2019-new coronavirus ( 2019- ncov ) \n\n first case of 2019 novel coronavirus in the united states 
01000000	use of convalescent plasma therapy in two covid-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome in korea \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 not yet has established its treatment , but convalescent plasma has been expected to increase survival rates as in the case with other emerging viral infections . we describe two cases of covid-19 treated with convalescent plasma infusion . both patients presented severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and showed a favorable outcome after the use of convalescent plasma in addition to systemic corticosteroid . to our knowledge , this is the first report of the use of convalescent plasma therapy for covid-19 in korea . \n\n graphical abstract \n\n introduction \n\n an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 ( sars-cov-2 ) infection , which began in wuhan , china , has emerged as a primary concern all over the world . the world health organization announced the risk assessment of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) as very high at the global level , and fatal cases are rapidly increasing . by march 24 , 2020 , more than 9,000 people were infected , and 126 people died , in south korea . without specific treatments for the virus , treatment options are being studied in addition to supportive care . evidence shows that the use of convalescent plasma to treat emerging viral infections , including sars , middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) , ebola virus disease or avian flu , can improve survival rates in patients whose condition worsens even with conventional treatment . however , the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment in covid-19 have not been known . here , we report two cases of severe covid-19 patients presenting acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) , who showed a favorable clinical course after the convalescent plasma infusion . this is the first report of the use of convalescent plasma to treat cases of sars-cov-2 infection in korea . \n\n case description \n\n case 1 \n\n a previously healthy 71-year-old man visited the community health center on february 22 , presenting 12 days of fever and cough . he underwent an examination of sars-cov-2 via real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rrt-pcr ) and diagnosed as covid-19 . he admitted to the local public medical center and 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine once daily was started . a chest radiograph obtained on day 2 showed mild opacities in the right lower lung , lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg twice daily was added . however , on day 3 , oxygen demand increased , so he transferred to the tertiary-care hospital . \n\n at the time of arrival , the patient had no subjective dyspnea under 4 l/min oxygen flow via nasal cannula , but the respiratory rate was over 30 times per minute . chest radiographs demonstrated rapidly aggravated bilateral infiltration . routine blood tests found white blood cell ( wbc ) count at 3.53 x 103/microl , with lymphopenia of 0.4 x 103/microl . c-reactive protein ( crp ) and lactic dehydrogenase ( ldh ) elevated up to 59.7 mg/l and 814 iu/l . routine chemistry , electrolyte , and blood coagulation tests revealed no abnormalities except mildly elevated aspartate transaminase . the level of interleukin 6 ( il-6 ) was increased as 101.3 pg/ml . serial bacterial culture and polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) for other respiratory viruses were all negative . \n\n intubation and mechanical ventilator care were started according to the management of ards . despite the continuous use of lopinavir/ritonavir , hydroxychloroquine and empirical antibiotics , he remained febrile with aggravated oxygenation profiles and chest images . laboratory test showed further elevation of crp ( 172.6 mg/l ) , il-6 ( 208.2 pg/ml ) . \n\n on day 9 , the arterial blood gas analysis showed pao2/fio2 of 86 , consistent with severe ards . intravenous methylprednisolone ( 1 mg/kg/day daily ) was started . on day 10 , convalescent plasma was obtained from a male donor in his 20s who had recovered from covid-19 for 21 days . he was diagnosed as covid-19 presenting fever , cough and pneumonia , however , showed complete recovery and did n't have any symptom at the time of plasma donation . he has met the blood donor eligibility criteria for plasma donation , including age , weight , reasonable-sized antecubital veins . also , allogeneic donor screening tests , defined by enforcement rules of the blood management act in korea , were acceptable for transfusion . donor apheresis was performed with spectra optia apheresis system ( cmnc software ; spectra optia idl tubing set ; terumo bct , lakewood , co , usa ) , 500 ml of convalescent plasma was collected . anti-sars-cov-2 igg antibody in plasma was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) ( novel coronavirus covid-19 igg elisa kit ; epitope diagnostics , san diego , ca , usa ) and optical density ( od ) ratio for igg was 0.586 ( cut-off value 0.22 ) . the plasma was divided into two doses and administered to the patient at 12 hours interval . each dose was given over for 1 hour . no adverse reaction occurred after the administration of convalescent plasma . \n\n the fever subsided , and oxygen demand decreased since day 11 . the patient 's condition much improved with decreased crp and il-6 to normal range ( 5.7 mg/l and < 1.5 pg/ml , respectively ) , and on day 18 , pao2/fio2 increased up to 300 ( fig . 1 ) . a chest x-ray revealed further resolution of both lung infiltrates ( fig . 2 ) . sars-cov-2 was quantified by detection of the rna-dependent rna polymerase region of the orf1b gene on rrt-pcr , the value of cycle threshold ( ct ) changed from 24.98 on day 10 to 33.96 on day 20 after plasma infusion ( fig . 1 ) . sars-cov-2 was negative after day 26 . the patient underwent a tracheostomy and currently , is successfully weaned from the mechanical ventilator . \n\n case 1 , responses to treatment .

( 131.1 mg/l , 474.7 pg/ml , 344 iu/l , respectively ) routine chemistry , electrolyte , and blood coagulation tests showed no abnormalities . bacterial cultures and the pcr for other respiratory viruses were all negative . \n\n she received high flow oxygen therapy but bilateral infiltration and oxygenation were deteriorated , so intubation and mechanical ventilator care started on day 4 . intravenous methylprednisolone ( 0.5 mg/kg/day daily ) was also added . she had sustained high fever with rapidly increasing crp ( 314 mg/l ) , wbc ( 21.79 x 103/microl ) , and persistent lymphopenia ( 0.5 x 103/microl ) . pao2/fio2 fell to 76 , consistent with severe ards . after applying for the prone position according to the management of ards with the use of steroids , chest images and the oxygen demand began to be improved . \n\n on day 6 , convalescent plasma was obtained from a male donor in his 20s who had recovered from covid-19 for 18 days . he was diagnosed as covid-19 presenting fever , cough and pneumonia however , showed complete recovery and serial pcrs for sars-cov-2 were all negative after hospital discharge . donor screening and plasma collection were performed as mentioned above in the case 1 . od ratio for igg was 0.532 and the plasma was administered to the patient in the same way as case 1 . there was no adverse reaction during the plasma transfusion . leukocytosis and lymphopenia were immediately recovered after convalescent plasma infusion . on day 9 , the density of bilateral infiltration on chest x-ray much improved with increased pao2/fio2 to 230 . the level of crp and il-6 also recovered to the normal range ( figs . 3 and 4 ) . sars-cov-2 was quantified by rrt-pcr ; the value of ct changed from 20.51 on day 5 to 36.33 on day 9 after plasma infusion ( fig . 3 ) . the patient is successfully extubated and discharged from the hospital on day 24 . sars-cov-2 was negative after day 20 . \n\n case 2 , responses to treatment .

study was approved by the institutional review board ( irb ) of severance hospital ( irb no . 4-2020-0076 ) and with participants ' written informed consent . the images are published under agreement of the patients . \n\n discussion \n\n the study of the therapeutic benefits of plasma transfusion of a cured person from infectious diseases began in the 20th century . as new antibiotics , antiviral agents , and vaccines are developed , administration of convalescent plasma is not a common treatment , but it can be still an important treatment in the absence of specific treatment of new infectious diseases . over the decades , convalescent plasma has proved its effectiveness as a potential treatment in patients with mers-cov , h1n1 and h5n1 avian flu , and sars-cov . a systemic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical effects of convalescent plasma shows a statistically significant reduction of mortality . in this context , convalescent plasma can be a promising treatment option for severe covid-19 patients . \n\n as can be seen in the two cases , both received lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine but showed persistent fever , rapidly aggravated hypoxemia and progressive bilateral infiltrations in accordance with the criteria of severe ards . after convalescent plasma infusion , the patients showed improved oxygenation and chest x-rays with decreased inflammatory markers and viral loads . \n\n intravenous methylprednisolone was started just before the convalescent plasma infusion in both cases . we did not use corticosteroids from the beginning as a routine treatment . current guidelines recommend that systemic corticosteroids should not be given routinely for the treatment of covid-19 due to the lack of evidence of its clinical efficacy on mortality reduction . however , we decided to start corticosteroids when the patients ' condition rapidly deteriorated to ards . methylprednisolone was administered one day and two days before the plasma infusion in case 1 and case 2 , respectively . serial laboratory and oxygenation parameters showed rapid improvement right after the corticosteroid administration even before the convalescent plasma infusion . \n\n ards is partly caused by cytokine storm and host immune responses . autopsy of patients dying from covid-19 shows diffuse alveolar damage with exudate and inflammation very similar to those seen in sars and mers-cov infections . theoretically , systemic corticosteroids may have a role to dampen excessive lung damage due to inflammatory responses . the recent article about risk factors associated with ards and death among covid-19 patients showed that treatment with methylprednisolone might be beneficial to reduce the risk of death for patients developing ards . however , corticosteroids are also thought to inhibit proper immune responses and viral clearance and delay antibody production . \n\n convalescent plasma infusion might play a role in the coexistence of benefits and concerns of corticosteroid use . antibodies contained in the convalescent plasma will suppress viruses . in an animal study , passively transferred antibodies can provide total protection as well as the maintenance of high levels of antibody titer until the host 's immune responses could be increased to clear the viral infection . besides , in vivo studies showed that the effects of neutralizing antibodies were not only limited to viral clearance , but also included acceleration of infected cell clearance . \n\n in our cases , the viral load estimated by ct values showed an increasing trend just before plasma infusion but began to decrease right after the use of convalescent plasma . although improvement of inflammatory marker and oxygenation could be contributed to the combined use of corticosteroid , decreased viral load of sars-cov-2 might mean the effectiveness of convalescent plasma in the treatment of covid-2 . \n\n convalescent plasma was administered after 22 days from the onset of symptoms in case 1 , and 7 days in case 2 , respectively . because these are not in the early phase of the disease , it is difficult to determine clearly that the decrease in the viral load shown in both cases is due to convalescent plasma or natural pathology of covid-19 . other studies about viral kinetics of covid-19 show naturally reducing viral titers after 7-10 days from onset in most patients . however , liu and colleagues reported that severe patients requiring intensive care unit admission due to covid-19 had high viral load for a longer period than in mild patients . both our cases presented severe ards and the viral loads were in increasing trend at the time of plasma infusion regardless of the date of onset . \n\n in case 2 , the patient showed lymphopenia from day 1 , and it persisted even after clinical improvement with corticosteroid use . when the convalescent plasma was administered on day 6 , lymphocyte count immediately rose to normal level ( from 0.52 x 103/microl to 1.21 x 103/microl ) and then remained in the normal range . patients with severe covid-19 pneumonia and ards also presented with lymphopenia in other studies . some authors hypothesized that continuous and gradual increases in lymphocyte count might be required for immunity against sars-cov-2 infection . in sars patients , lymphopenia existed at the onset of illness and persisted until the recovery period . these findings were consistent with the recovery of lymphocyte count with clinical improvement of case 2 after the use of convalescent plasma . \n\n we could not assess neutralizing antibody titers from the convalescent plasma . plasma with high neutralizing antibody titers is likely to be available from the patients in the convalescent phase recovered from severe infection . to use plasma for treatment , a neutralization test is suggested as the optimal assay for assessing proper donor or plasma . however , some studies showed that elisa igg correlates well with neutralization titers in mers cases so that it might be a suitable screening test for plasma donation . in our cases , donors presented bilateral pneumonia in the course of covid-19 and both showed positive results in the elisa igg test for sars-cov-2 . \n\n there are still limitations for the use of convalescent plasma . scientific evidence is insufficient due to the lack of large-scale clinical trials that may be representative of the target populations . second , the number of antibodies administered to each patient was not standardized . finally , convalescent plasma usually proceeds with other treatments , such as antiviral agents and steroids , which can affect the relationship between convalescent plasma and antibody , confounding the results . \n\n despite the limitations , our cases suggest that convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from covid-19 infection might be an additional option to treat patients without causing any severe adverse effects . also , when used with systemic corticosteroids , we might expect the possibility of reducing excessive inflammatory response by corticosteroids as well as promoting the reduction of viral loads by convalescent plasma simultaneously . further well-designed studies are needed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma transfusion in covid-19 patients . \n\n funding : this study was supported by research grants for deriving the major clinical and epidemiological indicators of people with hiv ( korea hiv/aids cohort study ,

00001000	considerations for scaling down fetal echocardiograms during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor : \n\n in the context of the covid-19 pandemic , institutions performing fetal echocardiograms ( fe ) are weighing the risks and benefits of reducing the number of fe to free up resources and limit nonessential visits to hospitals and clinics . these decisions must be made rapidly , often without a solid knowledge base . as of the first week of april 2020 , strategies adopted by canadian institutions varied considerably , with some significantly scaling down the number of fe and others maintaining the pace as before the pandemic . here , we wish to bring forth preliminary results of the frequency study , a population-based retrospective cohort built to assess the performance of prenatal congenital heart disease ( chd ) screening in quebec . although these results are preliminary , they show that scaling down the number of fe when the 2nd trimester ultrasound is normal can be done without a significant increased in undetected severe chds . \n\n the full protocol was previously published . briefly , we merged data from all fe performed in quebec between 2007 and 2015 with administrative healthcare data of all mother-child dyads in quebec during the same period . the cohort included 698,984 pregnancies . of them , 14,917 ( 2.1 % ) were referred for a fe for fetal or maternal risk factors despite a normal 2nd trimester ultrasound , in accordance to the scientific statement of the american heart association . \n\n we defined moderate to severe chd as chd prompting termination of pregnancy , requiring cardiac intervention or causing death < 12 months of age ( excluding isolated septal defects ) . we also present results for severe chd requiring intervention < 1 month of life . the table details the number needed to screen according to the fe indication . when the 2nd trimester ultrasound was normal , the number needed to screen was 222 for moderate to severe chd , and 361 for severe chd . we estimate that in the presence of a normal 2nd trimester ultrasound , not performing fe for maternal diabetes , family history of chd , maternal medication , and increased nuchal translucency would reduce the number of fe by > 40 % . in our cohort , > 95 % of undetected moderate to severe chd occurred in pregnancies without risk factors and were thus not referred for a fe . from the perspective of the overall population of quebec , not performing a fe when the 2nd trimester ultrasound in normal would increase the overall number of undetected significant chd by < 0.8 per 10,000 pregnancies . \n\n indication nb of fe ( % of all pregnancies referred for a fe ) moderate to severe chd severe chd number number needed to screen number number needed to screen all fe indications 30,396 ( 100 % ) 1,073 28 796 38 fe on fetuses with normal 2nd trimester u/s 12,266 ( 40 % ) 55 222 34 361 family history of chd 5,646 ( 19 % ) 27 209 15 376

indications 6,914 ( 23 % ) 143 48 100 69 \n\n chd : congenital heart disease , fe : fetal echocardiography \n\n considerations for scaling down fetal echocardiograms during the covid-19 pandemic * these fe were referred for high risk pregnancies but were performed before the 2nd trimester scan for various logistical reasons . these were excluded from the analysis as he results of the fe were known to the physicians performing the 2nd trimester scan . \n\n the covid-19 pandemic situation is ever changing and varies amongst institutions . the purpose of this letter is not to advocate for reducing the number of fe , but to provide evidence that , if it becomes temporarily necessary , it could be done rapidly for patients with a normal 2nd trimester scan without increasing the number of missed severe chd . in a non-pandemic situation , balancing the pros and cons of fetal cardiology referrals is more complex . such balancing should include chd specific detection rates , both fe and obstetrical ultrasound sensitivities and specificities , regional variations in detection rates , and cost-benefit analysis , all of which will be addressed in the final analyses of our study.table 1

01000000	early intervention likely improves mortality in covid-19 infection . \n\n while some risk factors have been identified , the reasons for the disparities in disease progression with covid-19 are unclear , with some patients developing progressive and severe disease while in others the course is benign . given this sense of randomness , and in the absence of a definitive treatment , medical professionals can feel helpless . it is useful to remember how much can be done to affect the trajectory of illness , even without a 'magic bullet ' . with evidence emerging that late presentation is directly associated with increased mortality , we make the case for increased vigilance in the community and earlier intervention . 
00000001	the coronavirus 2019-ncov epidemic : is hindsight 20/20 ? \n\n the newly identified coronavirus , covid-19 , was first reported in wuhan , china on december 31 , 2019 . in one month , reported cases outnumber those from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) epidemic . public health experts are working to better understand and address this epidemic . herein , we briefly discuss key cultural , policy and epidemiological aspects that might have contributed to this scenario . \n\n the covid-19 belongs to the same family as sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) , and all are zoonotic infections . the sars-cov 2002-03 epidemic originated from civet cats , sold in live wild animal markets - similar to the one in wuhan , where covid-19 has been linked to snakes , bats and pangolins . those so-called 'wet markets ' are common in parts of asia , africa , south america and oceania and frequently sell live wild animals- making it difficult to ensure meat safety . 'wet markets ' provide the perfect environment for viral and bacterial transmission from infected urine , feces , blood and other biofluids from slaughtered animals . in addition , their hygienic practices tend to be sub-optimal , contributing to transmission of a broad range of infections , including covid-19 . \n\n another aspect that may have influenced covid-19 rapid spread is china 's highly centralized , hierarchical and bureaucratic surveillance and health response system . during the sars-cov epidemic ( over 8300 cases in 26 countries ) , the government initially withheld information from the public and obstructed infectious diseases experts ' efforts to investigate and report outbreaks , which ultimately delayed the response . almost two decades after the sars-cov epidemic , china 's political system and pattern of crisis management may have jeopardized the country 's initial response to covid-19 . \n\n rapid spread of covid-19 is also influenced by high population density and mobility . wuhan is a major transport hub in china , with a population exceeding 11 million people . in response to covid-19 , the chinese government restricted 'unnecessary or non-essential large-scale public gatherings ' in late january , 2020 , in anticipation of domestic and international travel of millions of people for the chinese new year celebration . nearly half of china 's population ( more than 750 million people ) are currently living under various forms of travel restrictions . several countries have evacuated their nationals from wuhan and many airlines suspended flights to china . thousands cruise ship passengers where covid-19 cases were confirmed are been quarantined . while these measures may have curtailed transmission , by february 19 , 2020 , covid-19 was reported in roughly 30 countries , with almost 75,000 confirmed cases . thousands patients had severe infections , and over 2,100 deaths were reported so far . dozens of new deaths and thousands of new cases are still being reported every day . a recent mathematical modeling estimated that , by the end of january 2020 , more than 75,000 people were infected with covid-19 only in wuhan . notably , cases have occurred in patients who had not traveled to wuhan , indicative of person-to-person transmission . the world health organization ( who ) declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) on january 30 , 2020 . \n\n substandard implementation of appropriate infection prevention and control measures could influence covid-19 global spread . these include early recognition , source control and additional precautions at point-of-care for persons under investigation or with confirmed covid-19 . healthcare workers are at increased risk ; dr. li wenliang , a chinese ophthalmologist at wuhan central hospital who was one of the first to warn the public about covid-19 on 30 december 2019 ( and was later detained for doing so ) , died from the virus at aged 33 on february 7 , 2020 . more than 1,700 health care workers have been infected so far , with 6 fatalities . \n\n the myriad factors influencing the covid-19 pandemic are not unique . high population density , unsanitary conditions and an inadequate health care infrastructure were also at the core of the zika epidemic . brazil reported the first confirmed case of zika virus ( zikv ) in may 2015 , followed by a sharp increase in the number of neonates born with microcephaly . the government quickly declared zikv a national public health emergency in november 2015 , followed by who three months later . however , the brazilian zika emergency protocol did not mention or authorize legal abortion , despite who recommendations . more than 2700 babies were born with congenital zika syndrome in brazil . systemic problems continue to affect disenfranchised and densely populated communities in brazil that remain at risk of emerging or reemerging arboviruses . if another zikv outbreak occurs , young brazilian women still can not access safe abortion and might need to provide lifelong care for a severely disabled child . \n\n crowding , poverty , lack of basic health services , and a highly mobile population also played a key role in the ebolavirus outbreak in west africa from 2014 to 2016 and the ongoing outbreak in the democratic republic of the congo . ebolavirus outbreaks , like novel coronavirus outbreaks are a result of zoonotic spillover and subsequent human-to-human transmission . however , ebola differs in mode of transmission ( direct contact ) and has a much higher case fatality rate ( cfr ; 50 % -80 % ) . \n\n the cfr and basic reproductive rate ( ro ) of covid-19 is still unknown . some experts contend this virus is less pathogenic than mers-cov and sars-cov , which had cfrs of 34.4 % and 11 % , respectively . mers-cov and sars-cov were associated with high levels of nonsocomial transmissions in hospitals . one single patient with sars-cov who traveled from hong kong to canada resulted in 128 additional sars cases in toronto . similarly , one patient with mers-cov transferred from saudi arabia to south korea was linked to 186 additional mers-cov cases . covid-19 could foster a similar scenario . in global public health systems struggling with sub-optimal resources and inadequate infrastructure , this could be a recipe for disaster . \n\n as with any infectious disease emergency , public health officials need also to address the epidemic of fear . inappropriate prevention and treatment strategies such as herbal remedies and exaggerated numbers of persons affected by covid-19 cases have circulated on social media . the covid-19 pandemic , rapid spread and magnitude unleashed panic and episodes of racism against people of asian descent . efforts to address this scenario in the covid-19 and future epidemics need to consider traditional and social media communication , among other sources of information to curtail misinformation and prejudice . to avoid a global pandemic , timely surveillance , epidemiologic information about the pathogenicity and transmissibility of covid-19 are needed . healthcare workers should be adequately trained to identify , notify local authorities and provide appropriate care . animal markets , specifically 'wet markets ' should be closely monitored and meat safety ensured by public health authorities . \n\n according to munster et al . `` if we are proactive ( ... ) perhaps we will never have to discover the true epidemic or pandemic potential of 2019-ncov [ covid-19 ] . '' unfortunately , as of february 6 , 2020 , the covid-19 scale constitutes a pandemic and china 's delayed response influenced this scenario . ma guoqiang , municipal communist party secretary for wuhan , said `` right now i 'm in a state of guilt , remorse and self-reproach . if strict control measures had been taken earlier , the result would have been better than now '' during the first reports from the chinese government , covid-19 was referred as `` preventable and controllable '' . at present , it is neither . \n\n declaration of competing interest \n\n none . \n\n references \n\n nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-ncov outbreak originating in wuhan , china : a modelling study \n\n cross-species transmission of the newly identified coronavirus 2019-ncov \n\n a field study into hong kong 's wet markets : raised questions into the hygienic maintenance of meat contact surfaces and the dissemination of microorganisms associated with nosocomial infections \n\n\n\n world health organization . novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov ) : situation reports . available from : https : //www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/ \n\n the zika virus epidemic in brazil : from discovery to future implications \n\n what factors might have led to the emergence of ebola in west africa ? \n\n a novel coronavirus emerging in china : key questions for impact assessment \n\n cbs news . `` u.s. health officials issue quarantine order for 195 americans evacuated from china '' available from : https : //www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-outbreak-china-evacuations-wuhan-death-toll-today-flights-us-cases-2020-01-31/ \n\n supplementary materials \n\n supplementary material associated with this article can be found in the online version at doi:10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100289 . 
00001000	emerging technologies to combat covid-19 pandemic \n\n sars cov-2 infection is spreading like wildfire across the globe . there have been already more than 2.5 million documented infected cases , causing more than 177 thousand fatalities . the fact is that it took ninety-three days to the first million people , but for the second million , it took only thirteen days to happen . a large part of the globe is under lockdown with despair lingering and this universe in disarray . we need to look for competent and advanced technological solutions to combat this pandemic ( and similar epidemics and pandemics in the future ) ; otherwise , we could be staring at an unmanageable crisis . \n\n surge demands of critical care facilities have broken down the best health care models in the world and facilities . the best industries have failed in providing even the simple protective suits to their governments . there is a need to rethink why the healthcare sector has been so ineffective in treating such an infectious disease . we believe and recommend that the latest emerging technologies be urgently adopted at the global level , and the governments need to reinvest resources in making healthy nations , not powerful nations . significantly more investment in healthcare is the need of the day , especially in preventive medicine , community health and disaster management . the most critical asset in fighting this disease is our frontline doctors and healthcare workers . however , unfortunately , our system has failed in saving them from this infection also . south korea , japan , china , the usa , and many other developed countries are trying to employ the latest technologies to minimize the effect of this pandemic and decrease the loss of life and loss to the economy . \n\n s no emerging technology applications in covid-19 pandemic artificial intelligence ( ai ) detecting virus , individuals with fever & suspected symptoms of covid-19 through the integration of thermal imaging , ai , computer vision & cloud computing and accordingly advice for the treatment . further , this has brought down the time of genetic detection to minutes . 2 cloud computing all necessary information is stored at a computing platform and made available , to enables an enormous amount of computing power to the users with the help of the internet and helps in making real-time decisions in disease modelling . software can be employed with blockchain and other tools to model requirements of critical facilities at a different level , from the hospital to the nation . 3 big data provide storage capacity for extensive data of the population in a format that can be used efficiently for analysis and necessary action can be taken towardsthe prevention of disease transmission , movement , health monitoring and prevention system 4 telemedicine a patient can have a consultation from well-trained professionals on their medical conditions through video calls , avoiding the need for a hospital visit and thus helping the social distancing and man-to-man contact and disease transmission . however , these remote consultations are now possible with using better telecom infrastructure with virtual reality and augmented reality 5 blockchain algorithm help provides real-time information to all the strategic partners and traceability in the process of disease control and helps towards effective management of the supply chain 6 5g + smart applications the high-speed network allows real-time data of video and audio quality for patient data analysis , telemedicine , medical and surgical intervention 7 internet of things ( iot ) all devices are connected to the internet in the hospital and strategic locations . thus , these connected devices help to inform the medical staff of any errors and change of requirements during the treatment process ( similar to the factories of the future ) . 8 drones these unmanned vehicles controlled by remote location can undertake jobs of logistics provider and area surveillance and can also be used for disinfecting remote locations 9 robotics undertakes repetitive jobs with precision and reliability in the hazardous environment of infectious disease in and around the hospitals and can make an intelligent decision with inputs from the population data analyzed through ai 10 modern enterprise video communications platform application of the software helps in holding video and audio communications , chats , and webinars easily and quickly through large numbers of communication devices . 11 additive manufacturing undertakes manufacture of personalized devices for healthcare workers and patients , using 3d printing technology for the covid-19 , whenever required . 12 smartphone apps uses high-speed network and help to track strategic locations , infected patients and registering the data and modelling of disease outcomes as per the application software and other technologies can also be integrated with the software . \n\n applications of emerging technologies in covid-19 pandemic . \n\n table 1 \n\n covid-19 pandemic has taken the world as a surprise , and the majority of governments has failed to judge the magnitude of the problem and could not prepare themselves , in time . thus , they lost the opportunity to add more resources and deploy the latest technologies . this pandemic has triggered an unprecedented demand for critical resources , and they need to adopt all the emerging technologies to help to combat this pandemic by way of several applications ( table 1 ) , such as ; for population screening , infection tracking , and vaccine development , effective quarantine , prioritizing the use and allocation of resources , and designing targeted responses . to avoid coming in contact with human beings and physical objects , which may be potentially infected , several innovative and emerging technologies are being considered by the healthcare , authorities to protect their workers and also to deliver the treatment and other facilities to the needy patients . \n\n the positioning technologies are playing a crucial role in disaster management . agencies can quickly get precise positions of locations to undertake relief and rehabilitation efforts accordingly . smartphone-based application software is developed and used to identify the movement of people and resources and even to determine if they are in contact with an infected individual . the software is used to model and optimize the supply chain with the latest algorithms . however , this needs an upgraded telecommunication infrastructure to offer 5g functionality . molecular technologies with supercomputing facilities are trying to deliver the vaccine as early as possible . \n\n several engineering-based innovative and modern technologies need to be used to fight back this pandemic effectively . recent practices have proven that new-generation technologies have huge advantages , and they are the building blocks for industry 4.0 . thus , we see an essential role of these technologies in responding to this global emergency of public health challenges . an optimal help of the digital technologies such as artificial intelligence ( ai ) , big data , molecular biology , internet of things ( iot ) , cloud computing , blockchain , additive manufacturing , 5g and many more of such technologies are urgently needed to effectively improve the efficiency of the global efforts in epidemic monitoring , virus tracking , prevention , control , treatment , resource allocation and vaccine development . covid-19 pandemic has to be fought on the war level , with the latest technological innovations . industry 4.0 ( also known as the 4th industrial revolution ) has now started , and the medical world has to gear up to come forward to embrace these emerging and promising strategies and implementing medicine 4.0 . \n\n credit authorship contribution statement \n\n raju vaishya : conceptualization , writing - original draft . abid haleem : writing - original draft . abhishek vaish : writing - original draft . mohd javaid : writing - original draft . \n\n references \n\n coronavirus - worldometer . worldometer . accessed on 20th april 2020. https : //www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ \n\n covid-19 outbreak : it took the world 13 days to get its second million . hindustan times . 16th april 2020 ;

00000010	understanding unreported cases in the covid-19 epidemic outbreak in wuhan , china , and the importance of major public health interventions \n\n we develop a mathematical model to provide epidemic predictions for the covid-19 epidemic in wuhan , china . we use reported case data up to 31 january 2020 from the chinese center for disease control and prevention and the wuhan municipal health commission to parameterize the model . from the parameterized model , we identify the number of unreported cases . we then use the model to project the epidemic forward with varying levels of public health interventions . the model predictions emphasize the importance of major public health interventions in controlling covid-19 epidemics . \n\n 1 . introduction \n\n an epidemic outbreak of a new human coronavirus , termed the novel coronavirus covid-19 , has occurred in wuhan , china . the first cases occurred in early december , 2019 , and , by 29 january 2020 , more than 7000 cases had been reported in china . early reports advise that covid-19 transmission may occur from an infectious individual , who is not yet symptomatic . evidently , such asymptomatic infectious cases are not reported to medical authorities . for epidemic influenza outbreaks , reported cases are typically only a fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals . for the current epidemic in wuhan , it is likely that intensive efforts by chinese public health authorities have reduced the number of unreported cases . \n\n our objective is to develop a mathematical model , which recovers from data of reported cases , the number of unreported cases for the covid-19 epidemic in wuhan . for this epidemic , a modeling approach has been developed in , which did not consider unreported cases . our work continues the investigation in of the fundamental problem of parameter identification in mathematical epidemic models . we address the following fundamental issues concerning this epidemic : how will the epidemic evolve in wuhan with respect to the number of reported cases and unreported cases ? how will the number of unreported cases influence the severity of the epidemic ? how will public health measures , such as isolation , quarantine , and public closings , mitigate the final size of the epidemic ? \n\n 2 . results \n\n 2.1 . the model and data \n\n our model consists of the following system of ordinary differential equations : here , is time in days , is the beginning date of the epidemic , is the number of individuals susceptible to infection at time t , is the number of asymptomatic infectious individuals at time t , is the number of reported symptomatic infectious individuals ( i.e. , symptomatic infectious with sever symptoms ) at time t , and is the number of unreported symptomatic infectious individuals ( i.e. , symptomatic infectious with mild symptoms ) at time t. this system is supplemented by initial data \n\n figure 1 is the flow chart of the model ( 1 ) . the parameters of the model are listed in table 1 . \n\n we use three sets of reported data to model the epidemic in wuhan : first , data from the chinese cdc for mainland china ( table 2 ) , second , data from the wuhan municipal health commission for hubei province ( table 3 ) , and third , data from the wuhan municipal health commission for wuhan municipality ( table 4 ) . these data vary but represent the epidemic transmission in wuhan , from which almost all the cases originated in the larger regions . \n\n 2.2 . comparison of model ( 1 ) with the data \n\n for influenza disease outbreaks , the parameters , , , , , as well as the initial conditions , , and , are usually unknown . our goal is to identify them from specific time data of reported symptomatic infectious cases . to identify the unreported asymptomatic infectious cases , we assume that the cumulative reported symptomatic infectious cases at time t consist of a constant fraction along time of the total number of symptomatic infectious cases up to time t. in other words , we assume that the removal rate takes the following form : , where is the removal rate of reported symptomatic infectious individuals , and is the removal rate of unreported symptomatic infectious individuals due to all other causes , such as mild symptom , or other reasons . \n\n the cumulative number of reported symptomatic infectious cases at time t , denoted by , is our method is the following : we assume that has the following special form : we evaluate using the reported case data in table 2 , table 3 and table 4 . we obtain the model starting time of the epidemic from ( 4 ) : we fix , which corresponds to the total population of wuhan . we assume that the variation in is small during the period considered , and we fix . by using the method in section 4 , we can estimate the parameters and the initial conditions and from the cumulative reported cases given ( 4 ) . we then construct numerical simulations and compare them with data . \n\n the evaluation of , , , and , using the cumulative reported symptomatic infectious cases in table 2 , table 3 and table 4 , is shown in table 5 and in figure 2 below . \n\n according to table 2 , table 3 and table 4 , the time will correspond to 31 december . thus , in table 5 , the value means that the starting time of the epidemic is 5 january , the value means that the starting time of the epidemic is 28 december , and means that the starting time of the epidemic is 26 december . \n\n as long as the number of reported cases follows ( 1 ) , we can predict the future values of . for , , and , we obtain the actual number of reported cases for china are 8163 confirmed for 30 january , 11,791 confirmed for 30 january , and 14,380 confirmed for 1 february . thus , the exponential formula ( 4 ) overestimates the number reported after day 30 . \n\n from now on , we fix the fraction f of symptomatic infectious cases that are reported . we assume that between and of infectious cases are reported . thus , f varies between and 1 . we assume , and the average time during which the patients are asymptomatic infectious varies between one day and seven days . we assume that , the average time during which a patient is symptomatic infectious , varies between one day and seven days . thus , we fix . since f and are known , we can compute moreover , by following the approach described in the supplementary information , we should have and by using the approach described in the supplementary material , the basic reproductive number for model ( 1 ) is given by by using and ( 7 ) , we obtain \n\n 2.3 . numerical simulations \n\n we can find multiple values of , and f which provide a good fit for the data . for application of our model , , and f must vary in a reasonable range . for the corona virus covid-19 epidemic in wuhan at its current stage , the values of , and f are not known . from preliminary information , we use the values \n\n by using formula ( 9 ) for the basic reproduction number , we obtain from the data in table 2 that using model ( 1 ) and the values in table 5 , we plot the graph of , and the data for the confirmed cumulated cases in figure 3 , according to table 2 for china , table 3 for hubei , and table 4 for wuhan . we observe from these figures that the data for china and hubei fit the model ( 1 ) , but the data for wuhan do not fit the model ( 1 ) because the model ( 4 ) is not a good model for the data for wuhan in table 4 . the data for wuhan do not fit an exponential function . \n\n in what follows , we plot the graphs of , , and for wuhan by using model ( 1 ) . we define the turning point as the time at which the red curve ( i.e. , the curve of the non-cumulated reported infectious cases ) reaches its maximum value . for example , in the figure below , the turning point is day 54 , which corresponds to 23 february for wuhan . \n\n in the following , we take into account the fact that very strong isolation measures have been imposed for all china since 23 january . specifically , since 23 january , families in china are required to stay at home . in order to take into account such a public intervention , we assume that the transmission of covid-19 from infectious to susceptible individuals stopped after 25 january . therefore , we consider the following model : for , where \n\n the figure below takes into account the public health measures , such as isolation , quarantine , and public closings , which correspond to models ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) . by comparison of figure 4a with figure 5 , we note that these measures greatly mitigate the final size of the epidemic , and shift the turning point about 24 days before the turning point without these measures . \n\n 3 . discussion \n\n an epidemic outbreak of a new human coronavirus covid-19 has occurred in wuhan , china . for this outbreak , the unreported cases and the disease transmission rate are not known . in order to recover these values from reported medical data , we present the mathematical model ( 1 ) for outbreak diseases . by knowledge of the cumulative reported symptomatic infectious cases , and assuming ( 1 ) the fraction f of asymptomatic infectious that become reported symptomatic infectious cases , ( 2 ) the average time asymptomatic infectious are asymptomatic , and ( 3 ) the average time symptomatic infectious remain infectious , we estimate the epidemiological parameters in model ( 1 ) . we then make numerical simulations of the model ( 1 ) to prodict forward in time the severity of the epidemic . we observe that public health measures , such as isolation , quarantine , and public closings , greatly reduce the final size of the epidemic , and make the turning point much earlier than without these measures . we observe that the predictive capability of model ( 1 ) requires valid estimates of the parameters f , , and , which depend on the input of medical and biological epidemiologists . our results can contribute to the prevention and control of the covid-19 epidemic in wuhan . \n\n as a consequence of our study , we note that public health measures , such as isolation , quarantine , and public closings , greatly reduce the final size of this epidemic , and make the turning point much earlier than without these measures . with our method , we fix , , and f and get the same turning point for the three data sets in table 2 , table 3 and table 4 . we choose , which means that around of cases are reported in the model , since cases are very well documented in china . thus , we only assume that a small fraction , , were not reported . this assumption may be confirmed later on . \n\n we also vary the parameters , , and f , and we do not observe a strong variation of the turning point . nevertheless , the number of reported cases are very sensitive to the data sets , as shown in the figures . formula ( 4 ) for is very descriptive until 26 january for the reported case data for china and hubei but is not reasonable for wuhan data . this suggests that the turning point is very robust , while the number of cases is very sensitive . we can find multiple values of , , and f that provide a good fit for the data . this means that , , and f should also be evaluated using other methods . the values days and days are taken from information concerning earlier corona viruses , and are used now by medical authorities . \n\n the predictive capability of models ( 1 ) and ( 10 ) requires valid estimates of the parameters f ( fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported as symptomatic infectious ) , the parameter ( average time asymptomatic infectious are asymptomatic ) , and the parameter ( average time symptomatic infectious remain infectious ) . in figure 4 , we graph as a function of f and for the data in table 2 , to illustrate the importance of these values in the evolution of the epidemic . the accuracy of these values depend on the input of medical and biological epidemiologists . \n\n in influenza epidemics , the fraction f of reported cases may be significantly increased by public health reporting measures , with greater efforts to identify all current cases . our model reveals the impact of an increase in this fraction f in the value of , as evident in figure 6 above , for the covid-19 epidemic in wuhan . \n\n 4 . materials and methods \n\n 4.1 . method to estimate the parameters of ( 1 ) from the number of reported cases \n\n in the following the parameters and are fixed . \n\n step 1 : since f and , we know that \n\n step 2 : by using equation ( 3 ) , we obtain and and therefore moreover , by using ( 12 ) at , \n\n step 3 : in order to evaluate the parameters of the model , we replace by on the right-hand side of ( 1 ) ( which is equivalent to neglecting the variation of susceptibles due to the epidemic , which is consistent with the fact that grows exponentially ) . therefore , it remains to estimate and in the following system : by using the first equation , we obtain and therefore , by using ( 13 ) , we must have so , by substituting these expressions into ( 15 ) , we obtain \n\n here , we fix tau in such a way that the value becomes the dominant eigenvalue of the linearized equation ( 21 ) and is the positve eigenvector associated with this dominant eigenvalue . thus , we apply implicitly the perron-frobenius theorem . moreover , the exponentially growing solution that we consider ( which is starting very close to ( 0,0 ) ) follows the direction of the positive eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue . \n\n by dividing the first equation of ( 16 ) by we obtain and hence by using the second equation of ( 16 ) , we obtain by using ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) , we obtain by using ( 18 ) , we can compute \n\n 4.2 . computation of the basic reproductive number \n\n in this section , we apply results in diekmann , heesterbeek , and metz and van den driessche and watmough . the linearized equation of the infectious part of the system is given by the corresponding matrix is and the matrix a can be rewritten as where therefore , the next generation matrix is which is a leslie matrix , and the basic reproductive number becomes by using ( 19 ) , we obtain and , by using , we obtain \n\n author contributions \n\n

00000001	what next for the coronavirus response ? \n\n the novel coronavirus outbreak centred in china has been declared a public health emergency of international concern . what now ? john zarocostas reports from geneva . \n\n the decision by who director-general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus to declare on jan 30 the novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov ) outbreak a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) is expected to intensify global preparedness and response efforts . however , the declaration is likely to test the resilience of the 2005 international health regulations , in light of measures introduced by many countries that appear to differ from who 's temporary recommendation not to limit travel and trade . \n\n didier houssin , chair of the emergency committee that advised dr tedros , said in a press conference that the committee `` almost unanimously concluded '' it was time to recommend declaring a pheic , `` considering first , the increase in the number of cases in china ; second , the increase in the number of countries affected with cases ; and also that some countries have taken questionable measures concerning travellers '' . at its first meeting , a week before , the committee was split on whether to recommend a pheic . \n\n tedros was careful to clarify that the announcement was not a criticism of china , saying that the main reason for the pheic declaration `` is not because of what is happening in china , but because of what is happening in other countries . our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems , and which are ill prepared to deal with it '' . \n\n chen xu , china 's ambassador to the un in geneva , told reporters the declaration is `` what the who needed to do and was within its duty ... the pheic and the recommendations will be conducive to have more coordinated actions '' . he noted that most people in china and around the world `` have no idea what is pheic . people need some time to digest '' . \n\n tarik jasarevic , a who spokesperson , told the lancet that issuing a pheic generally has three effects . first , who issues temporary recommendations ; these are non-binding but practically and politically significant measures that can address travel , trade , quarantine , screening , and treatment , setting global standards of practice . second , who can hold countries to account when they needlessly exceed these global standards . third , a pheic enhances coordination , cooperation , and global solidarity . \n\n takeshi kasai , regional director of who 's regional office for the western pacific , which includes china , told the lancet that strengthening preparedness and building capacity might prove more challenging for countries with few resources , saying that `` some countries may need to repurpose existing resources to support their preparedness efforts . who is ready to support countries in this work '' . \n\n among the recommendations in seven key areas , dr tedros underscored `` first , there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade . who does not recommend limiting trade and movement '' . russia , mongolia and north korea have closed their land border with china , while australia , new zealand , the us , and others have banned entry for most travellers from china . \n\n other recommendations are to support countries with weaker health systems ; accelerate the development of vaccines , therapeutics , and diagnostics ; combat the spread of rumours and misinformation ; review preparedness plans ; identify gaps and evaluate the resources needed to identify , isolate , and care for cases , and prevent transmission ; share data , knowledge , and experience ; and for countries to work together in a spirit of solidarity and cooperation . \n\n health experts and emergency specialists believe the pheic will give focus to what needs to be done to contain the epidemic . rebecca katz , director of the center for global health science and security at georgetown university , told the lancet that the pheic declaration `` is an important political signal to the world and will hopefully provide who [ with ] the authority it needs to promote travel and trade advisories , or , in this case , engage with countries imposing travel restrictions on china when who has advised against such moves '' . the global community will also look to who , katz added , to `` provide a single source of validated information on the outbreak '' . \n\n emanuele capobianco , director for health and care at the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies , told the lancet the determination of a pheic will also strengthen collaboration and shift `` what may have been a response that was ... until recently focused on the asia-pacific into an approach that is more global and more coordinated '' . \n\n jasarevic said that who is working with experts from the public and private sectors : including scientists , clinicians , disease trackers , and supply chain specialists : to coordinate the response , including providing biomedical and essential supplies for the management of 100 cases for vulnerable countries , accelerating access to therapeutics and vaccines , carrying out clinical trials , and conducting briefings with clinicians treating patients . 
00011000	covid-19 in cardiac arrest and infection risk to rescuers : a systematic review \n\n background \n\n there may be a risk of covid-19 transmission to rescuers delivering treatment for cardiac arrest . the aim of this review was to identify the potential risk of transmission associated with key interventions ( chest compressions , defibrillation , cardiopulmonary resuscitation ) to inform international treatment recommendations . \n\n methods \n\n we undertook a systematic review comprising three questions : 1 ) aerosol generation associated with key interventions ; 2 ) risk of airborne infection transmission associated with key interventions ; and 3 ) the effect of different personal protective equipment strategies . we searched medline , embase , cochrane central register of controlled trials , and the world health organisation covid-19 database on 24th march 2020 . eligibility criteria were developed individually for each question . we assessed risk of bias for individual studies , and used the grade process to assess evidence certainty by outcome . \n\n results \n\n we included eleven studies : two cohort studies , one case control study , five case reports , and three manikin randomised controlled trials . we did not find any direct evidence that chest compressions or defibrillation either are or are not associated with aerosol generation or transmission of infection . data from manikin studies indicates that donning of personal protective equipment delays treatment delivery . studies provided only indirect evidence , with no study describing patients with covid-19 . evidence certainty was low or very low for all outcomes . \n\n conclusion \n\n it is uncertain whether chest compressions or defibrillation cause aerosol generation or transmission of covid-19 to rescuers . there is very limited evidence and a rapid need for further studies . \n\n review registration : prospero crd42020175594 
00001000	health security capacities in the context of covid-19 outbreak : an analysis of international health regulations annual report data from 182 countries . \n\n background : public health measures to prevent , detect , and respond to events are essential to control public health risks , including infectious disease outbreaks , as highlighted in the international health regulations ( ihr ) . in light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) , we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events . methods : we used 18 indicators from the ihr state party annual reporting ( spar ) tool and associated data from national spar reports to develop five indices : ( 1 ) prevent , ( 2 ) detect , ( 3 ) respond , ( 4 ) enabling function , and ( 5 ) operational readiness . we used spar 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices , in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest . we also analysed data at the regional level ( using the six geographical who regions ) . findings : of 182 countries , 52 ( 28 % ) had prevent capacities at levels 1 or 2 , and 60 ( 33 % ) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2 . 81 ( 45 % ) countries had prevent capacities and 78 ( 43 % ) had response capacities at levels 4 or 5 , indicating that these countries were operationally ready . 138 ( 76 % ) countries scored more highly in the detect index than in the other indices . 44 ( 24 % ) countries did not have an effective enabling function for public health risks and events , including infectious disease outbreaks ( 7 [ 4 % ] at level 1 and 37 [ 20 % ] at level 2 ) . 102 ( 56 % ) countries had level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place . 32 ( 18 % ) countries had low readiness ( 2 [ 1 % ] at level 1 and 30 [ 17 % ] at level 2 ) , and 104 ( 57 % ) countries were operationally ready to prevent , detect , and control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease ( 66 [ 36 % ] at level 4 and 38 [ 21 % ] at level 5 ) . interpretation : countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent , detect , and respond to outbreaks . half of all countries analysed have strong operational readiness capacities in place , which suggests that an effective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled , including to covid-19 . findings from local risk assessments are needed to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to covid-19 . capacity building and collaboration between countries are needed to strengthen global readiness for outbreak control . funding : none . 
00000001	the role of the american heart association in the global covid-19 pandemic \n\n as the united states and the world confront the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) pandemic , the american heart association ( aha ) and its thousands of science volunteers have an important role to play to help stop the spread . \n\n that may seem counterintuitive to some , considering that covid-19 is an infectious disease and the aha has spent the last nearly 100 years focused on noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases ( cvds ) , stroke , and other vascular disorders . however , covid-19 is very much a concern of the aha because patients with underlying cardiovascular conditions appear to face a greater risk of complications . in addition , as an organization dedicated to overall health and well-being , we are very concerned about significant domestic and global health problems . \n\n contagious infections and cvd \n\n even before the first outbreak of covid-19 , the aha and its professional members were aware of evidence suggesting that acute coronary events and strokes could be triggered by common infections . respiratory and urinary tract infections , among others , have been associated with a short-term increase in the risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke . influenza in particular is associated with increased risk , and some clinical trials provide additional evidence that the influenza vaccination decreases cardiovascular risk . since 2006 , the aha and the american college of cardiology have recommended that patients with cvd receive the influenza vaccination to prevent flu-related respiratory disease and other complications , including cardiovascular events . this approach represents the first instance of routine use of anti-infective strategies to reduce cvd . mechanisms for the increase in risk with influenza remain unclear but may reflect greater cardiovascular stress in the setting of infection , reduced oxygenation in the setting of lung disease , or systemic inflammation with consequent thrombosis or intraplaque disruption predisposing to rupture . \n\n although much remains unknown about covid-19 , it is reasonable to assume that increased risk of cardiovascular events after infection is possible . in china , cvd and hypertension were associated with an increased covid-19 case fatality rate . among patients who died of covid-19 , substantial cardiac damage was observed . furthermore , it appears that elderly people with coronary heart disease or hypertension are more likely to be infected and to develop more severe symptoms . surveillance for cardiovascular events after covid-19 seems very warranted , and this could be an area for future investigation . \n\n preparing to mitigate spread \n\n it is important to understand that we are in a mitigation phase for this pandemic . mitigation strategies are nonpharmaceutical interventions to help slow the transmission of the virus in communities before drugs for treatment or a vaccine becomes available from the centers for disease control and prevention . however , although prevention and avoidance are important , preparedness in clinical settings , particularly acute care hospitals , is now crucial to ensure the ability to care for more covid-19 cases . the number of reported cases is increasing rapidly . as of march 16 , the centers for disease control and prevention had confirmed 1629 us cases and 41 deaths in the united states . more than 125 000 people worldwide have covid-19 , and > 4600 people have died , mostly in china . \n\n during this mitigation phase , it is crucial that public health agencies , hospitals , healthcare systems , and others focused on the public 's health learn from missteps early on and subsequent successful mitigation in china . we need to anticipate what is to come . it is increasingly likely that critical care physicians and cardiologists will be called on to assist in the care of persons with covid-19 who have underlying cvd or who develop cardiac complications . many of the aha clinical care volunteers will be on the front lines . \n\n aha 's role also will be crucial in the dissemination of science-based information about covid-19 for patients , caregivers , and their families from a trusted source . we will continue to track developments by following reports from the centers for disease control and prevention and the world health organization and provide science-based , common-sense updates and guidance on our website , in social media , and in syndicated news stories that reach millions of people . we will continue to share best practices on how people can protect themselves from covid-19 ; steps that individuals with cvd , stroke , and other vascular conditions should take ; and measures people should take if they develop covid-19 . at times of crisis especially , people need understandable and actionable information from credible sources . \n\n the aha 's expanded mission \n\n our mission is to be a relentless force for a world of longer , healthier lives , and our 2030 impact goals aim to achieve a 2-year increase in healthy life expectancy in the united states and 3 years globally . cardiovascular health and brain health are integral to extending healthy life expectancy . furthermore , optimized mental health extends healthy life expectancy . \n\n social determinants of health , including education , income , geographic location , and access to care , are essential to cardiovascular and brain health as well as overall health and well-being . in the face of this crisis , we are likely to witness the dramatic ways in which social determinants affect outcomes to severe , acute illness . countries and regions with fewer resources are likely to face higher mortality and morbidity than areas with greater access to care , particularly as increasing numbers of cases overwhelm local healthcare systems , as is already being seen in parts of italy . ultimately , the case fatality rate of covid-19 is likely to be less a property of the virus or of individuals infected and more a function of each healthcare system affected . \n\n once the aha began to tackle social determinants and to work to extend healthy life expectancy , it became imperative to ensure that the organization address aspects of health and well-being that may have traditionally fallen outside of cardiovascular research and practice . areas such as brain health , air quality , health insurance reform , rural health , and more are now part of our mission . there is no way to draw a sharp demarcation between cardiovascular health and general health and well-being . \n\n health equity is incorporated into all aha activities , and health equity is never challenged more than in the face of crisis . we have already begun to see threats to individuals related to this pandemic : disinformation , disparities in access to health care , xenophobia , racism , and prejudice . each has the potential to undermine the public health response . trust is essential to a rational approach to this crisis , and the aha is one of the most trusted brands in the world . \n\n positioned to help \n\n as a catalyst for change and a convener , the aha will continue to work with our many partners to educate and activate the public and to partner with other organizations to take action . our work touches on population-level , clinical , translational , and basic science research . the aha maintains a large network of cardiologists , neurologists , and other specialists and disciplines : more than 30 000 committed individuals with clinical and scientific expertise . we have partnerships with us and international governments , other international agencies , large health systems , industry , and others with the capacity to assist . \n\n this outbreak underscores the need to modernize our public health surveillance infrastructure with state-of-the-art , interoperable data systems , security to protect data , a workforce prepared for the information age , and partnership and innovation between the public and private sectors . the aha will support efforts to make this modernization happen at the local , state , federal , and global levels . this will ensure a robust public health infrastructure that can target focused and effective local , state , and national action to improve population health and well-being . \n\n we call on our aha members , clinical volunteers , and others to aid these efforts ; to heed the guidance of the centers for disease control and prevention , world health organization , and state and local health departments ; and to share best practices . \n\n together with the public health and healthcare community , we are working toward the same goals : preventing covid-19 to the fullest extent possible , ensuring that people with covid-19 can be identified and receive care , developing treatments and a vaccine , ultimately stopping covid-19 , and laying the groundwork for the robust public health and healthcare system of the future . \n\n acknowledgments \n\n the authors thank john mcfarland for his assistance in preparing the manuscript . \n\n disclosures \n\n dr elkind receives ancillary funding from roche and study drug in kind from the bms-pfizer alliance for eliquis for a national institutes of health-funded trial of stroke prevention ;

01000000	sars-cov-2 and covid-19 : what are our options ? where should we focus our attention on to find new drugs and strategies ? \n\n dear editor , \n\n adhesion and viral entry : this first phase consist of membrane interaction between the host cell and the virus , allowed by the ace2 receptor . cleavage and activation of sarrs-cov spike protein ( s ) by a host cell protease is essential for viral entry , this host cell protease is called tmprss2 . potential in vitro proven inhibitor of tmprss2 is camostat mesylate . \n\n endocytosis : this second phase allows the virus inside the host cell . one known regulator of endocytosis is the ap2-associated protein kinase 1 ( aak1 ) . using artificial intelligence it was possible to find a good inhibitor of aak1 like baricitinib , a known janus kinase inhibitor which can reduce both viral entry and inflammation in patients . another option in altering the endocytosis process is hydroxychloroquine , a derivate of chloroquine , which alters ph ( by increasing it ) of endosome and lysosome essential for membrane fusion between host cell and the virus . an in vitro experiment showed that in chloroquine treated cells endosomes vesicles were abnormally enlarged . this indicates an altered maturation process of endosomes , blocking endocytosis , resulting in failure of further transport of virions to the replication site . \n\n replication : targeting the rna-dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) showed low specificity and low potency , nevertheless the most promising drug belonging to this class is remdesivir . therapeutic and prophylactic use of remdesivir has recently been tested in nonhuman primate model of mers-cov infection . administration of the drug 24 hours prior to inoculation prevented the virus from inducing clinical disease and prevented replication in respiratory tissue , thus preventing lung lesions to form . therapeutic usage of remdesivir ( 12 hours after inoculation ) showed similar results . human clinical trials are ongoing . \n\n protein protease : targeting the main protease protein is another suitable option , preventing the virus from building its proteins . one example in doing so is the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir : which has shown to be of some use for sars-cov and mers-cov infected patients in the past . \n\n cytokine storm : this has been shown to be the result of the secretion of many cytokines , during the infection , especially in patients with extensive lung injuries . sars-cov , mers-cov and sars-cov-2 show a relatively higher mortality rates then other coronaviruses , this might suggest that inflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis . if that 's the case , targeting the coronavirus alone with antiviral therapy might not be enough to reverse highly pathogenic infections . among all sars-cov structural proteins ( n , s , e and m ) only the nucleocapsid protein ( n ) significantly induced the activation of interleukin-6 ( il-6 ) promotor in human airway epithelial cell cultures . il-6 gene expression is activated by the n protein which binds to the nf-kb regulatory element on il-6 promoter and facilitates its translocation from cytosol to nucleus . the n protein is essential for il-6 secretion to happen , since deletion of the c-terminus of the n protein resulted in the loss of function in the activation of il-6 . this shows how high levels of il-6 are directly induced by sars-cov-2 , besides being also associated with extensive lung injuries , making il-6 a good therapeutic target , with drugs like tocilizumab a known il-6 inhibitor . \n\n free circulation : targeting viral components such as the spike proteins of the virus with specific antibodies is another therapeutic option , this happens during free circulation of the virus . coronaviruses neutralizing antibodies usually target the spike proteins ( s ) on the viral surface of the virus which allow it to enter host cells . the s protein has two subunits : one that mediates cell binding s1 , and one that mediates cell fusion , the s2 domain . the most neutralizing antibodies are shown to target the receptor interaction site in s1 subunit . the latest developed antibody showing neutralizing properties is the human 47d11 antibody , which was shown to target the s1b receptor binding domain of sars-s and sars2-s . despite its capacity to inhibit infected cells with sars-s and sars2-s , the binding activity did not compete with s1b to the ace2 receptor . this seems to indicate that 47d11 neutralizes sars-cov and sars-cov-2 through a yet unknown mechanism different from binding interference . this study shows how , despite the high capability of the virus to mutate , targeting conserved core structure of the s1b receptor is a good strategy . this also provides evidence for the design of a sars-cov-2 vaccine composed of viral structural proteins , like the s proteins . \n\n since the outbreak of covid-19 many efforts are being made to engineer new drugs and to find ways of fighting this pandemic . we write this letter to focus everybody 's attention on the possible and viable strategies to find new drugs and therapeutic compounds . in doing so we describe the virus cycle of infection , showing for each phase a possible compound of therapeutic use . \n\n in conclusion we showed all phases of the virus cycle that can possibly be targeted , showing the most promising targets . we aimed to shed some light on the future drugs and therapies that need to be engineered in the future to come . \n\n declaration of competing interest \n\n the author declares no conflict of interest . \n\n references \n\n simultaneous treatment of human bronchial epithelial cells with serine and cysteine protease inhibitors prevents severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus entry \n\n covid-19 : combining antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments \n\n hydroxychloroquine , a less toxic derivative of chloroquine , is effective in inhibiting sars-cov-2 infection in vitro \n\n prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir ( gs-5734 ) treatment in the rhesus macaque model of mers-cov infection \n\n nucleocapsid protein of sars-cov activates interleukin-6 expression through cellular transcription factor nf-kappab \n\n 
00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region , presented to the emergency with a 3-day history of headaches , dizziness , intermittent nausea , and vomiting . brain mr showed a tumor that was entirely confined within the third ventricle , causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the child has an uncomplicated recovery after surgery , and covid-19 was eventually ruled out after a 14-day quarantine . \n\n finally , we have some additional tips for conducting surgery under level 3 precautions . a comfortable goggle and use of antifogging agent are very helpful . in addition , surgeons should avoid unnecessary conversation and perform the surgery as gently as possible to prevent splashing blood in a negative pressure operating room . \n\n neuro-oncology patients may become infected with covid-19 , and thus surgery for these patients can not be avoided . as neurosurgeons , it is crucial that we do our utmost to care for our patients while ensuring our own safety at the same time . in these challenging times , we have faith that through our concerted efforts , this pandemic

to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a

00001000	role of mask/respirator protection against sars-cov-2 \n\n to the editor \n\n since its outbreak on december 31 , 2019 , in wuhan , a central city in china , coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) has now spread to almost all countries in the world . it has been declared a pandemic , and it has infected over 1,041,126 people in a very short time , with 55,132 deaths as ofapril 3 , 2020 . wearing masks/respirators and practicingself-isolation at home have been recommended as guidelines for thepublic . however , the problem is the number of cases among medical personnel . interestingly , a higher risk of infection was noticed in male professionals . there are currently many types of masks/respirators available , ranging from simple surgical masks designed to protect wearers from microorganism transmission and fit loosely to the user 's face , through n95 masks used to prevent users from inhaling small airborne particles . these must fit tightly to the user 's face . masks differ primarily in their maximum internal leakage rate limit . surgical masks are designed to protect against droplets or particles with a diameter of > 100 mum , whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) virus is essentially spherical , albeit slightly pleomorphic , with a diameter of 60-140 nm and 100 times smaller than the pore diameter . thus , surgical masks can not prevent inhalation of small airborne particles ; however , both can protect users from large droplets and sprays . the pn-en 149:2001 standard defines 3 protection classes for half masks : filtering face piece 1 ( ffp1 ) , filtering face piece 2 ( ffp2 ) , and filtering face piece 3 ( ffp3 ) . the maximum internal leakage limit is 25 % for ffp1 , 11 % for ffp2 , and 5 % for ffp3 . class ffp1 masks retain about 80 % of particles smaller than 2 mum , ffp2 ones retain 94 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum , and ffp3 ones retain 99.95 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum ( table ) . \n\n test ffp1 ffp2 ffp3 concentration of harmful substances till 4 x nds till 10 x nds till 30 x nds leakage < 22 % < 8 % < 2 % penetration < 20 % < 6 % < 1 % initial expiration resistance at 95 l/min < 210 pa < 240 pa < 300 pa \n\n filtration efficiency for each class of masks \n\n abbreviations : ffp1 , filtering face piece 1 ; ffp2 , filtering face piece 2 ; ffp3 , filtering face piece 3 ; nds , the highest acceptable concentration of the harmful factor . \n\n at the moment , we may meet divergent recommendations for the use of masks . while the centers for disease control and prevention recommend the use of masks in low-risk and high-risk situations , the world health organization advises applying masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations . long et al conclude in their meta-analysis that the use of n95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza . they suggest that n95 respirators should not be recommended for the general public and non-high-risk medical staff who are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients . \n\n the potential of face masks to reduce the spread of respiratory infections could be useful . wang et al indicated that 10 of 213 medical professionals with no mask were infected by covid-19 as compared with 0 of 278 wearing n95 respirators . \n\n it is also worth noting that the respirator increases resistance to inhalation . the longer they are used , the more difficult breathing becomes because of more absorbed dust . what is more , the effectiveness decreases with the increase of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the respirator and face ( the so-called dead space ) . the concentration of carbon dioxide in the dead space increases with each subsequent exhalation . therefore , masks should be replaced frequently . additionally , to improve the comfort of use , masks use 1-way exhalation valves , which accelerate the circulation of gases.6 \n\n to conclude , the use of protective masks can and should be the first protection against sars-cov-2 transmission to medical personnel . medical personnel should use class ffp3 masks . additionally , the application of visors to cover the entire face during contact with the patient is worth considering . \n\n references \n\n association between 2019-ncov transmission and n95 respirator use . \n\n comparison of performance of three different types of respiratory protection devices . \n\n protecting healthcare staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome : filtration capacity of multiple surgical masks . \n\n a close shave ? performance of p2/n95 respirators in health care workers with facial hair : results of the beards ( adequate respiratory defences ) study . \n\n effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza : a systematic review and meta-analysis . \n\n cloth masks versus medical masks for covid-19 . 
00001000	emergency trauma care during the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in china \n\n background \n\n a novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in wuhan , hubei province , in december 2019 ; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans . china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease . however , a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking . to regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak , we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in wuhan . \n\n main body \n\n the article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 , indications for emergency surgery , and infection prevention and control for medical personnel , providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period . \n\n conclusions \n\n the measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of covid-19 . \n\n background \n\n a novel corona virus disease ( covid-19 ) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) began in wuhan , hubei province , china , in december 2019 . by february 13 , 2020 , more than 60,000 cases were confirmed , nearly 50,000 in hubei alone , and the source of the infection was yet to be definitely determined . the world health organization ( who ) has declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) . considering the current rate of human to human transmission , most countries in the world should be well prepared for the potential global covid-19 pandemic . china is on the frontline in the fight against the virus , and medical staff have become exhausted due to the excessive workload brought on by the outbreak . medical testing tools and personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , such as face shields , goggles , and gloves , have become scarce and have had to be rationed among teams and medical centers , with severe shortage in hubei , the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak . a report from a neurosurgery department of a teaching hospital in wuhan showed that from december 25 , 2019 , to february 6 , 2020 , eight covid-19 suspected patients were admitted , and three were confirmed . consequently , 12 medical personnel were infected ( 11 nurses and one doctor ) , among whom three had been in close contact with the first confirmed case . according to the data released by the national health commission ( nhc ) of the people 's republic of china , a total of 1716 medical personnel infections had been reported nationwide , accounting for 3.8 % of the total confirmed cases by 24:00 on february 11 , 2020 , of which six ( 0.4 % ) had died . of these , hubei province reported 1502 cases , accounting for 87.5 % of the total medical personnel infections , while wuhan city reported 1102 cases , accounting for 73.4 % . notably , medical personnel are the most valuable resource during the outbreak . how to protect them from infection is one of the foremost challenges in the fight against sars-cov-2 . \n\n although china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of sars-cov-2 , severe trauma can still occur . during the outbreak , the population of trauma patients may be diverse in terms of infection status , including patients who were previously healthy , suspected to be infected , confirmed infected , close contacts of infected individuals , and asymptomatic carriers . thus , balancing optimal trauma care while preventing further spread of the viral infection during the outbreak is a major challenge . \n\n to our knowledge , there is no relevant consensus or clinical guideline available on the indications of , timing of or perioperative protection during emergency surgery for trauma . to protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of trauma care , we have summarized the recommended perioperative infection prevention and control measures for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 based on current practical experience in china and the published literature on surgical practice during the past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) , ebola virus , and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n main text \n\n general principles \n\n special requirements for the hospitals receiving trauma patients during the outbreak \n\n emergency department : set up a triage area for assessment of all patients at admission , allowing early recognition of possible sars-cov-2 infection and immediate isolation of patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection in an area separate from other patients . \n\n radiology department : a dedicated ct room should be kept on standby for the examination of infected patients . \n\n operating room ( or ) : a relatively isolated negative-pressure or is preferable ; if there is no permanent negative-pressure or , a temporarily modified negative-pressure or the main operating suite of the hospital can be converted . \n\n intensive care unit ( icu ) : an isolated area should be prepared in the icu , and suspected patients should be treated in a single space . \n\n intrahospital transport : although an ideal trauma center with a door-to-door ct room and negative-pressure or are preferable in this situation , most regions in china do not operate such facilities . therefore , a predetermined transport route should be used to minimize exposure , and any intrahospital transport should utilize dedicated carts demarcated by a warning logo equipped with protective supplies and hand disinfectants . the patient should wear a medical mask , and the walls and the floor of the passageways and the elevator should be covered with a plastic lining . \n\n to control the spread of covid-19 , basic principles for treating infectious diseases should be followed , and necessary measures should be taken before receiving trauma patients . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n precaution level applicable personnel and scenarios personal protective equipment level 1 triage , emergency department clean non-sterile long gown , disposable head cover , disposable medical mask , and gloves . level 2 close contact with suspected patients , or handling secretions , feces , and personal items belonging to patients ; performing ct scan ( fig . 1 ) disposable head cover , gloves , disposable coverall , n95 respirator or equivalent , goggle or face shield , rubber boots or fluid-resistant overshoes , etc . level 3 close contact with suspected patients , or collecting blood , respiratory tract samples of patients , especially for endotracheal intubation , airway care , and sputum suction , as well as emergency surgery ( fig . 2 ) . on the basis of wearing secondary protective equipment such as goggle or face shield , other protective equipment should be strengthened . for instance , adding disposable surgical clothing and gloves in addition to disposable coverall and gloves . two layers of gloves covering protective clothing and surgical clothes sleeves , respectively , use of a powered air purifying respirator ( papr ) . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n to standardize and simplify the precaution measures and equipment required for different personnel and scenarios in trauma care , we adopted a three-level precaution protocol in trauma care ( table 1 ) . \n\n all levels of precaution were based on implementing standard precautions , including hand hygiene , respiratory hygiene , and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment ( ppe ) according to different risk levels . proper training of the standard donning and doffing procedures is the basis of effective protection . in epidemic areas such as hubei province , all patients can be regarded as potentially suspected patients during the outbreak , and the level of the precaution should be elevated . \n\n triage \n\n classification of the patients suspected cases clinical confirmed cases ( hubei only ) pathogenic confirmed cases diagnostic basis outside hubei province : two of the clinical manifestations with at least one of the epidemiological histories , three of the clinical manifestations without epidemiological history suspected patient in hubei province with ct findings of pneumonia suspected or clinically confirmed patients with at least one pathogenic evidence epidemiological investigation 1 . travel to or residence in wuhan in the 14 days prior to symptom onset ; 2 . close contactb with sars-cov-2 infection ( rrt-pcr positive ) within 14 days before onset ; 3 . exposed to patients from wuhan and surrounding areas , or from a community with patients who reported fever or respiratory symptoms14 d before onset ; 4 . clustering outbreak . - - clinical manifestations and ct scan 1 . fever and/or respiratory symptoms ; 2 . imaging characteristics of covid-19 ( ct : multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes in early stage , which are obvious in the peripheral lung , and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs , and lung consolidation may occur in severe cases ) ; 3 . the total number of white blood cells in the early stage is normal or decreased , and the lymphocyte count is decreased - - pathogenic evidence null null 1 . detection of sars-cov-2 in respiratory specimens and sera by rrt-pcr assays ; 2 . by virus dna sequencing , respiratory or blood samples dna sequence highly homologous with sars-cov-2 . \n\n diagnostic criteria of covid-19a \n\n covid-19 coronavirus induced disease , sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 , rrt-pcr real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \n\n athe diagnostic criteria were defined according to guidance for the diagnosis and management for covid-19 ( 5th edition ) released by national health commission of people 's republic of china in feb. 4 , 2020 \n\n bclose contact is defined as follows : \n\n - healthcare-associated exposure , including providing direct care for covid-19 patients , working with healthcare workers infected with novel coronavirus , visiting patients , or staying in the same close environment as a covid-19 patient \n\n - working together in close proximity or sharing the same classroom environment with a covid-19 patient \n\n - traveling together with a covid-19 patient in any kind of conveyance \n\n - living in the same household as a covid-19 patient \n\n trauma patients during the outbreak should be managed using the relevant contents in table 2 , and they should complete a brief epidemiological investigation at the triage stage . however , the trauma patients ' history may be unreliable , as they may not have time to be detailed . more emphasis should be placed on the objective data . during the outbreak in wuhan , a total of 32 emergency operations were performed in a tertiary care hospital , including 19 suspected and seven pathogenic confirmed cases . in addition , nine covid-19 patients in another tertiary care hospital underwent gastrointestinal surgery , but in all of these patients , covid-19 was diagnosed postoperatively . it is worth noting that there have been many cases of asymptomatic patients with an incubation period . the maximum incubation period was reported to be 24 days . \n\n evaluation \n\n trauma care is highly time dependent and requires rapid and effective evaluation and management . during the outbreak , primary and secondary surveys should be completed while maintaining the premise of effective protection . \n\n general principles of evaluation \n\n dynamic evaluation strategies should be conducted throughout the trauma care process . the personal protective equipment ( ppe ) worn by medical personnel may result in limited or incomplete physical examinations ( such as palpation and auscultation ) . therefore , injury assessment may rely on radiological examinations . \n\n radiology evaluation \n\n a chest ct scan is recommended for all severe trauma patients if there is no contraindication . if the chest ct scan is not possible due to critical condition , the patient should be treated as a suspect for infection until infection is excluded . \n\n level 3 ppe during ct examination \n\n if the hospital has a trauma resuscitation unit , complete x-ray including but not limited to the chest and focused assessment with sonography for trauma ( fast ) in the trauma resuscitation unit should be performed . for hemodynamic stabilization , a ct scan including but not limited to the chest should be performed ( fig . 1 ) . if the hospital does not have a trauma resuscitation unit , patients with hemodynamic instability should be resuscitated in the emergency department and undergo fast simultaneously . once the hemodynamic status is stable enough , the ct scan should be performed as soon as possible . \n\n ct scan protocol for trauma patients suspected of having covid-19 : medical personnel should first determine the method and scope of the scan , including but not limited to the chest , according to the mechanism of injury . for stab wounds , the segment and body cavity near the wound should be examined . for gunshot wounds , due to the high kinetic energy of the projectiles , the tortuous wound path , and the heavy tissue damage , the scanning range should be expanded appropriately . patients who have sustained blunt injuries with high energy , such as traffic injuries , should usually be scanned with enhanced scanning ranging from head to mid-thigh ( including the whole lower limb when there is lower limb injury ) . enhanced scanning is helpful in providing further information on organ injury , and three-dimensional reconstruction of blood vessels and bone should be performed when major vascular and bone injury is suspected . \n\n ct features of covid-19 : it should be noted that the pulmonary imaging changes of covid-19 vary depending on the patient 's age , immunity status , stage of disease at the time of the scan , underlying disease , and drug intervention . reports have shown that in the early stage of infection , ct shows multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes , which are obvious in the peripheral lung and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs . in severe cases , lung consolidation could occur . in addition , special attention should be paid to discerning between covid-19 infection and pulmonary contusion . \n\n blood and pathogen specimen collection \n\n if possible , nasopharyngeal swabs , sputum , lower respiratory tract secretions , and blood samples should be collected and sent for rrt-pcr in the emergency period . if no respiratory tract specimens are collected before the operation due to time constraints , they can be collected during or after the operation . \n\n all specimens shall be deemed to be potentially infectious . collection , transportation , and processing of any clinical specimens should be performed by biological safety training qualified medical staff . level 3 precautions should be adopted to minimize the possibility of exposure . \n\n the results of rrt-pcr may be falsely negative due to the influence of sampling , transportation , extraction , and testing . recent observations have shown that 30 to 40 % of patients with covid-19 ct features were rrt-pcr negative . as a result , the protection standard can not be lowered due to negative results . since the rrt-pcr test can take several hours to confirm the diagnosis , chest ct is recommended as the basis for the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 in suspected patients , especially in areas with a high incidence of the disease . the use of chest ct not only helps to control the spread of the epidemic but can also ensure definitive care for trauma injuries in a timely manner . \n\n emergency surgery \n\n emergency surgery is of great importance for severe trauma patients , the aim of which includes hemorrhage control , contamination abatement , and compartment pressure relief as soon as possible . effective prevention of sars-cov-2 transmission by standard intraoperative protective measures is an important indicator of a successful operation . from the available evidence , sars-cov-2 is spread mainly through respiratory droplets and contact , while aerosol and fecal-oral transmission are still under investigation . from the existing evidence and our practical experience , all medical staff should adopt level 3 precautions when entering the or . \n\n or preparation \n\n an independent negative pressure operation room is the first choice . operations can only be performed when the pressure is between - 10 and - 5 pa . if a negative pressure or is not available , a relatively isolated or with an independent purification system is an alternative option . nevertheless , the purification system should be shut down during the operation , and a final disinfection should be performed postoperatively . as in standard trauma protocols , the more critical patient should be operated on first . if two or more suspected or confirmed infected patients arrive in the or , a 30-min disinfection is warranted before the subsequent operation . the dedicated or should be clearly marked as covid-19 exclusive . \n\n the dedicated covid-19 or should be designed with a special passage and elevator . the design should focus on shortening the outdoor distance , reducing the chance of human contact , and limiting the time spent in suspected contaminated areas . materials and equipment should only be delivered by specially assigned staff . people inside the or are not allowed to leave during the operation , and outdoor personnel should not enter without permission . surgical articles should be clearly identified , and the use of disposable items is recommended . to maintain pressure , surgical supplies ( surgical instruments , dressings , single-use consumables , high-value consumables , medications , and relevant items ) should be well prepared in advance . only unidirectional flow is permitted ( nothing should be taken out once it is entered during the operation ) . personnel movement and the frequency of door opening are strictly limited . nondisposable items should be disposed of postoperatively in strict accordance with regulations . two suction apparatuses are optimal , one of which is for exclusive use by the anesthesiologist . the negative pressure aspirator should be immediately placed on the patient 's face to minimize the spread of respiratory secretions after entering the operation room . \n\n ppe for operation personnel \n\n protective clothing for surgical personnel : a after wearing protective clothing and inner gloves , b after wearing operating clothes and outer gloves \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe donning \n\n the topic of intraoperative protection remains controversial because most surgeons have no experience performing surgery while wearing heavy and airproof contagion gowns and goggles . according to practice in china , some medical personnel wore two surgical gowns , two contagion gowns and four pairs of gloves for surgery during the covid-19 epidemic . instead of enhancing protective effects , such excessive protection can reduce the visual , auditory , and tactile sensitivity of the surgeon , thus reducing the precision of surgical operations ( fig . 2 ) . the influence of excessive protection on the surgeon mainly includes ( 1 ) difficulty breathing , ( 2 ) fog on goggles and face shields that interfere with vision , ( 3 ) constriction of visual fields , ( 4 ) loss of flexibility due to multiple layers of gloves , and ( 5 ) double or triple the duration of the operation . a practical lesson had been learned from the case of a 7-year-old girl with suspected covid-19 infection who was subjected to an urgent craniotomy due to obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a third ventricle germ cell-derived tumor . the surgical team adopted a level 3 precaution including n95 respirators or papr , and full coverage with protective gowns ( shoe covers included ) and sterile surgical gowns . consequently , an operation that would have taken 2-3 h ended up taking 10 h. possible solutions for reducing the impact of ppe on surgery include reducing the or temperature ( minimizing the formation of moisture on goggles ) and enhancing the lighting in the room to obtain better vision . all ppes are fit for single use except papr . the steps of donning and doffing should be completed under professional supervision ( fig . 3 ) . \n\n anesthesia \n\n regional nerve block is the first choice for limb surgeries . general anesthesia is recommended for neurosurgery , torso trauma , or multiple trauma with shock . \n\n attention should be paid to avoid aerosol generation caused by coughing and other causes in airway operations . intubation should be performed after rapid induction and full muscle relaxation to ensure complete disappearance of spontaneous breathing , and sputum aspiration before intubation should be avoided . remote endotracheal intubation by disposable glide scope with an assistant is recommended . awake endotracheal intubation is not recommended for patients with a difficult airway , hypoxia , or unconsciousness . if face mask or laryngeal mask ventilation is able to maintain oxygenation , multiple tools ( fiberoptic bronchoscope , glide scope , light stick , laryngeal mask ) can be used to assist endotracheal intubation after rapid induction of general anesthesia . if not , cricothyroid laryngotomy should be performed without any hesitation . rapid induction via oral intubation is recommended in cases of a possibly full stomach . mask positive pressure ventilation after administration should be avoided . no emetic measure is recommended . extra caution should be taken on when a nasogastric tube is in place . covid-19 can cause pulmonary inflammation that can induce added lung injury , restricted crystal fluid , and protective ventilation . the proper mechanical ventilation parameters include limited tidal volume ( < 8 ml/kg ) and airway pressure ( platform pressure < 30 cm h2o ) ; 5-10 cm h2o positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation ( peep ) is optional for alveoli expansion and oxygenation maintenance . permissive hypercapnia is also acceptable . \n\n surgical strategy \n\n the concept of damage control surgery should be followed to simplify the operation . it is optimal to finish an operation within 90 min , and strategies such as packing hemostasis , external fixation , and temporary abdominal closure are helpful to shorten the operation time . surgical personnel should be highly focused and closely coordinated . gentle movement is essential to avoid accidental injury and contamination caused by the spattering of blood , fluid , and bone debris . limiting rinsing and drainage of bodily fluids is another key to effectively reducing intraoperative contamination . reliable hemostasis should be maintained to prevent bleeding around the incision . excessive negative pressure suction and violent operations are prohibited . it is also suggested that electrotome use is not suitable under this scenario ; if it must be used , the power should be minimized . smoke should be quickly suctioned to avoid aerosol generation . \n\n postoperative management \n\n postoperative management of patients \n\n after the operation , the patient should be transferred to an isolation ward in the icu . the endotracheal tubes should be removed under analgesia to avoid violent coughing while the patient is stable . sputum aspiration should be performed by a closed suction system . trauma and surgery can impair the patient 's immune function . clinically , some asymptomatic covid-19 patients suffered rapid deterioration after surgery . surgeons and anesthesiologists should be aware that acute lung injury caused by covid-19 may exist preoperatively or worsen postoperatively . therefore , special attention should be paid to the monitoring of body temperature , infection , and hemodynamic index . reexamination of chest ct and rrt-pcr tests is also important . for postoperative trauma patients with fever , traumatic , or operative complications should also be considered to differentiate them from covid-19 . attention should be paid to symptomatic and etiological treatment . postoperative dyspnea and hypoxia should also be differentiated from complications such as pulmonary embolism . nutritional support and prevention of other complications ( bacterial infection , stress ulcer , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , and deep venous thrombosis ) should also be strengthened . \n\n quarantine \n\n based on current experience , if the medical personnel complete the operation successfully and comply with all the regulations without any accidental exposure , the patient does not need to be quarantined . otherwise , a 14-day medical observation is obligatory , and timely treatment is needed when any abnormalities occur . notably , some literature recommends a routine 14-day quarantine for relevant personnel involved in the operation for sars-cov-2 confirmed patients . however , extreme safety often results in severe incapacity to help patients , so a balance between safety and efficiency must be maintained . \n\n discussion \n\n the national health commission of china initially decided to temporarily call the disease novel coronavirus pneumonia or ncp . it was not until february 12 , 2020 , that the official name covid-19 was announced by the who . shortly after the who announced the disease 's official name , the virus causing it was named sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , highlighting the new virus 's similarity to the sars virus identified in 2003 . based on epidemiological data up to jan. 4 , 2020 , the estimated r0 was 2.2 ( 95 % ci , 1.4 to 3.9 ) , while the latest study surveying cases up to feb. 14 , 2020 , further calculated that the r0 of covid-19 was 3.77 . therefore , researchers estimated that in terms of infection ability , sars-cov-2 was slightly higher than the sars virus and significantly higher than the mers-cov . according to clinical characteristic analysis of sars-cov-2 infection in china , the mortality was 2.01 % out of 28,018 cases as of feb. 6 , 2020 . by human-to-human transmission , sars-cov-2 had spread rapidly from wuhan , china , to 24 other countries as of feb. 12 , 2020 . the number of cases within china and other countries is rapidly increasing , and it is estimated that for every additional 10 % decrease in transmission rate , the peak population will be reduced by 20-47 % . the cumulative number of infected cases and deaths will be reduced by 23-49 % due to comprehensive interventions . if current interventions continue , it is expected that the number of people infected will peak in early march 2020 . based on the epidemiological analysis , only 1.18 % of the patients had direct contact with wild animals , 31.30 % of the patients had been in wuhan , and 71.80 % of the patients had contact with people from wuhan . common symptoms included fever , cough , and diarrhea . a total of 76.4 % of patients had radiologic findings manifested as pneumonia , with the remaining patients exhibiting normal radiologic findings . poor clinical outcomes can be predicted by disease severity , including oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count , and chest ct manifestations . \n\n the transmission by aerosols is still under investigation . aerosols are solid , liquid , solid , and liquid granular substances suspended in the air , such as dust , smoke , fog , and microorganisms . these may be the `` flying vehicles '' for covid-19 . covid-19 aerosols are related to the increased risk of covid-19 transmission . tracheal intubation , noninvasive ventilation , tracheotomy , manual ventilation before intubation , bronchoscopy , cardiopulmonary resuscitation , sputum suction , and other airway operations , as well as the use of electrotome , suction , and drainage , all inevitably produce a large number of aerosols . when carrying out these operations , the protection and training of medical personnel should be strengthened , and preventive measures to protect against aerosols are recommended , including n95 respirators , papr , goggles or face shields , disposable fluid-resistant gowns , and limiting the number of people in the room . \n\n based on experience from the hospital in wuhan , patients with covid-19 have high mortality after surgery . as of february 14 , 2020 , 6 gastrointestinal operations were performed in the general surgery department of the authors ' hospital ; one 60-year-old male died of respiratory failure 14 days after surgery , and one died of septic shock , for a mortality rate of 33.33 % . another group of eight covid-19 confirmed patients in zhongnan hospital of wuhan university underwent gastrointestinal surgeries ( seven gastrointestinal tumors and one benign case ) ; one patient died of covid-19 after left hemicolectomy with the diagnosis of postoperative recurrence of renal cancer involving the descending colon with intestinal obstruction , and one tumor patient died from postoperative complications of abdominal infection , for a mortality rate of 25 % . trauma patients usually have massive hemorrhage , shock , and contamination . damage control strategies should be complied with to correct fatal triads caused by hypothermia , acidosis , and coagulopathy . meanwhile , effective oxygen therapy and organ function support are also indispensable . \n\n moreover , additional attention should be paid to patients in critical condition and to those who develop severe pneumonia after trauma . among covid-19 patients , critical patients , including patients with respiratory failure , septic shock , and other organ failures , have accounted for 29 % ~32 % . identifying high-risk groups with severe illness can also help reduce the occurrence of poor prognosis . the possible high-risk groups include patients over 65 years old , patients with obesity , and patients with other diseases ( such as chronic pulmonary disease , hypertension , heart disease , kidney disease , diabetes , tumor , and immune deficiency ) . \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe doffing \n\n the covid-19 outbreak poses significant challenges to hospital staff and specifically trauma surgeons , which must offer optimal and timely care despite the circumstances . strict safety protocols must be adhered to when carrying out emergency care for patients with severe trauma and other surgical diseases , which means that all the measures shall be carried out to preserve the ability of the medical staff to achieve the purpose of effective care without sacrificing the safety of all involved . the perspectives in this paper can not be a substitute for clinical judgment and expert consultation but can help provide up-to-date guidance on the clinical management of emergency surgery for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 ( fig . 4 ) . \n\n conclusion \n\n in conclusion , the covid-19 outbreak raises several issues concerning the safety of medical personnel and patients . areas with high incidence rates of covid-19 should conduct operations with caution and protection should be strengthened while ensuring suitable facilities to carry out optimal care with maximal safety . with the accumulation of clinical experience and in-depth research , some of the practices may require modification when additional high-quality evidence emerges . the above is china 's experience in treating trauma patients during the covid-19 outbreak . we hope that this report will help hospitals worldwide prepare for future covid-19 outbreaks and infection control in unexpected conditions . \n\n abbreviations \n\n covid-19 \n\n corona virus disease \n\n sars-cov-2 \n\n severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \n\n

00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region

causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the

00001000	'let us help'- why senior medical students are the next step in battling the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n as senior medical students in the uk , we read dr stein 's letter on the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) 2 and began wondering where we fit in , in this pandemic . as the government heads into a 'war footing ' 13 , there is an increased need for medical staff . there is speculation of bringing back retired doctors , many of who fall into at risk categories . with clinical placement and exams cancelled , we are determined to use our hard-earned skills in some way , to help in what is the biggest global emergency of our lifetime . 
00001000	role of mask/respirator protection against sars-cov-2 \n\n to the editor \n\n since its outbreak on december 31 , 2019 , in wuhan , a central city in china , coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) has now spread to almost all countries in the world . it has been declared a pandemic , and it has infected over 1,041,126 people in a very short time , with 55,132 deaths as ofapril 3 , 2020 . wearing masks/respirators and practicingself-isolation at home have been recommended as guidelines for thepublic . however , the problem is the number of cases among medical personnel . interestingly , a higher risk of infection was noticed in male professionals . there are currently many types of masks/respirators available , ranging from simple surgical masks designed to protect wearers from microorganism transmission and fit loosely to the user 's face , through n95 masks used to prevent users from inhaling small airborne particles . these must fit tightly to the user 's face . masks differ primarily in their maximum internal leakage rate limit . surgical masks are designed to protect against droplets or particles with a diameter of > 100 mum , whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) virus is essentially spherical , albeit slightly pleomorphic , with a diameter of 60-140 nm and 100 times smaller than the pore diameter . thus , surgical masks can not prevent inhalation of small airborne particles ; however , both can protect users from large droplets and sprays . the pn-en 149:2001 standard defines 3 protection classes for half masks : filtering face piece 1 ( ffp1 ) , filtering face piece 2 ( ffp2 ) , and filtering face piece 3 ( ffp3 ) . the maximum internal leakage limit is 25 % for ffp1 , 11 % for ffp2 , and 5 % for ffp3 . class ffp1 masks retain about 80 % of particles smaller than 2 mum , ffp2 ones retain 94 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum , and ffp3 ones retain 99.95 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum ( table ) . \n\n test ffp1 ffp2 ffp3 concentration of harmful substances till 4 x nds till 10 x nds till 30 x nds leakage < 22 % < 8 % < 2 % penetration < 20 % < 6 % < 1 % initial expiration resistance at 95 l/min < 210 pa < 240 pa < 300 pa \n\n filtration efficiency for each class of masks \n\n abbreviations : ffp1 , filtering face piece 1 ; ffp2 , filtering face piece 2 ; ffp3 , filtering face piece 3 ; nds , the highest acceptable concentration of the harmful factor . \n\n at the moment , we may meet divergent recommendations for the use of masks . while the centers for disease control and prevention recommend the use of masks in low-risk and high-risk situations , the world health organization advises applying masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations . long et al conclude in their meta-analysis that the use of n95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza . they suggest that n95 respirators should not be recommended for the general public and non-high-risk medical staff who are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients . \n\n the potential of face masks to reduce the spread of respiratory infections could be useful . wang et al indicated that 10 of 213 medical professionals with no mask were infected by covid-19 as compared with 0 of 278 wearing n95 respirators . \n\n it is also worth noting that the respirator increases resistance to inhalation . the longer they are used , the more difficult breathing becomes because of more absorbed dust . what is more , the effectiveness decreases with the increase of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the respirator and face ( the so-called dead space ) . the concentration of carbon dioxide in the dead space increases with each subsequent exhalation . therefore , masks should be replaced frequently . additionally , to improve the comfort of use , masks use 1-way exhalation valves , which accelerate the circulation of gases.6 \n\n to conclude , the use of protective masks can and should be the first protection against sars-cov-2 transmission to medical personnel . medical personnel should use class ffp3 masks . additionally , the application of visors to cover the entire face during contact with the patient is worth considering . \n\n references \n\n association between 2019-ncov transmission and n95 respirator use . \n\n comparison of performance of three different types of respiratory protection devices . \n\n protecting healthcare staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome : filtration capacity of multiple surgical masks . \n\n a close shave ? performance of p2/n95 respirators in health care workers with facial hair : results of the beards ( adequate respiratory defences ) study . \n\n effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza : a systematic review and meta-analysis . \n\n cloth masks versus medical masks for covid-19 . 
00001000	emergency trauma care during the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in china \n\n background \n\n a novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in wuhan , hubei province , in december 2019 ; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans . china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease . however , a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking . to regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak , we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in wuhan . \n\n main body \n\n the article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 , indications for emergency surgery , and infection prevention and control for medical personnel , providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period . \n\n conclusions \n\n the measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of covid-19 . \n\n background \n\n a novel corona virus disease ( covid-19 ) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) began in wuhan , hubei province , china , in december 2019 . by february 13 , 2020 , more than 60,000 cases were confirmed , nearly 50,000 in hubei alone , and the source of the infection was yet to be definitely determined . the world health organization ( who ) has declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) . considering the current rate of human to human transmission , most countries in the world should be well prepared for the potential global covid-19 pandemic . china is on the frontline in the fight against the virus , and medical staff have become exhausted due to the excessive workload brought on by the outbreak . medical testing tools and personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , such as face shields , goggles , and gloves , have become scarce and have had to be rationed among teams and medical centers , with severe shortage in hubei , the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak . a report from a neurosurgery department of a teaching hospital in wuhan showed that from december 25 , 2019 , to february 6 , 2020 , eight covid-19 suspected patients were admitted , and three were confirmed . consequently , 12 medical personnel were infected ( 11 nurses and one doctor ) , among whom three had been in close contact with the first confirmed case . according to the data released by the national health commission ( nhc ) of the people 's republic of china , a total of 1716 medical personnel infections had been reported nationwide , accounting for 3.8 % of the total confirmed cases by 24:00 on february 11 , 2020 , of which six ( 0.4 % ) had died . of these , hubei province reported 1502 cases , accounting for 87.5 % of the total medical personnel infections , while wuhan city reported 1102 cases , accounting for 73.4 % . notably , medical personnel are the most valuable resource during the outbreak . how to protect them from infection is one of the foremost challenges in the fight against sars-cov-2 . \n\n although china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of sars-cov-2 , severe trauma can still occur . during the outbreak , the population of trauma patients may be diverse in terms of infection status , including patients who were previously healthy , suspected to be infected , confirmed infected , close contacts of infected individuals , and asymptomatic carriers . thus , balancing optimal trauma care while preventing further spread of the viral infection during the outbreak is a major challenge . \n\n to our knowledge , there is no relevant consensus or clinical guideline available on the indications of , timing of or perioperative protection during emergency surgery for trauma . to protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of trauma care , we have summarized the recommended perioperative infection prevention and control measures for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 based on current practical experience in china and the published literature on surgical practice during the past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) , ebola virus , and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n main text \n\n general principles \n\n special requirements for the hospitals receiving trauma patients during the outbreak \n\n emergency department : set up a triage area for assessment of all patients at admission , allowing early recognition of possible sars-cov-2 infection and immediate isolation of patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection in an area separate from other patients . \n\n radiology department : a dedicated ct room should be kept on standby for the examination of infected patients . \n\n operating room ( or ) : a relatively isolated negative-pressure or is preferable ; if there is no permanent negative-pressure or , a temporarily modified negative-pressure or the main operating suite of the hospital can be converted . \n\n intensive care unit ( icu ) : an isolated area should be prepared in the icu , and suspected patients should be treated in a single space . \n\n intrahospital transport : although an ideal trauma center with a door-to-door ct room and negative-pressure or are preferable in this situation , most regions in china do not operate such facilities . therefore , a predetermined transport route should be used to minimize exposure , and any intrahospital transport should utilize dedicated carts demarcated by a warning logo equipped with protective supplies and hand disinfectants . the patient should wear a medical mask , and the walls and the floor of the passageways and the elevator should be covered with a plastic lining . \n\n to control the spread of covid-19 , basic principles for treating infectious diseases should be followed , and necessary measures should be taken before receiving trauma patients . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n precaution level applicable personnel and scenarios personal protective equipment level 1 triage , emergency department clean non-sterile long gown , disposable head cover , disposable medical mask , and gloves . level 2 close contact with suspected patients , or handling secretions , feces , and personal items belonging to patients ; performing ct scan ( fig . 1 ) disposable head cover , gloves , disposable coverall , n95 respirator or equivalent , goggle or face shield , rubber boots or fluid-resistant overshoes , etc . level 3 close contact with suspected patients , or collecting blood , respiratory tract samples of patients , especially for endotracheal intubation , airway care , and sputum suction , as well as emergency surgery ( fig . 2 ) . on the basis of wearing secondary protective equipment such as goggle or face shield , other protective equipment should be strengthened . for instance , adding disposable surgical clothing and gloves in addition to disposable coverall and gloves . two layers of gloves covering protective clothing and surgical clothes sleeves , respectively , use of a powered air purifying respirator ( papr ) . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n to standardize and simplify the precaution measures and equipment required for different personnel and scenarios in trauma care , we adopted a three-level precaution protocol in trauma care ( table 1 ) . \n\n all levels of precaution were based on implementing standard precautions , including hand hygiene , respiratory hygiene , and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment ( ppe ) according to different risk levels . proper training of the standard donning and doffing procedures is the basis of effective protection . in epidemic areas such as hubei province , all patients can be regarded as potentially suspected patients during the outbreak , and the level of the precaution should be elevated . \n\n triage \n\n classification of the patients suspected cases clinical confirmed cases ( hubei only ) pathogenic confirmed cases diagnostic basis outside hubei province : two of the clinical manifestations with at least one of the epidemiological histories , three of the clinical manifestations without epidemiological history suspected patient in hubei province with ct findings of pneumonia suspected or clinically confirmed patients with at least one pathogenic evidence epidemiological investigation 1 . travel to or residence in wuhan in the 14 days prior to symptom onset ; 2 . close contactb with sars-cov-2 infection ( rrt-pcr positive ) within 14 days before onset ; 3 . exposed to patients from wuhan and surrounding areas , or from a community with patients who reported fever or respiratory symptoms14 d before onset ; 4 . clustering outbreak . - - clinical manifestations and ct scan 1 . fever and/or respiratory symptoms ; 2 . imaging characteristics of covid-19 ( ct : multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes in early stage , which are obvious in the peripheral lung , and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs , and lung consolidation may occur in severe cases ) ; 3 . the total number of white blood cells in the early stage is normal or decreased , and the lymphocyte count is decreased - - pathogenic evidence null null 1 . detection of sars-cov-2 in respiratory specimens and sera by rrt-pcr assays ; 2 . by virus dna sequencing , respiratory or blood samples dna sequence highly homologous with sars-cov-2 . \n\n diagnostic criteria of covid-19a \n\n covid-19 coronavirus induced disease , sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 , rrt-pcr real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \n\n athe diagnostic criteria were defined according to guidance for the diagnosis and management for covid-19 ( 5th edition ) released by national health commission of people 's republic of china in feb. 4 , 2020 \n\n bclose contact is defined as follows : \n\n - healthcare-associated exposure , including providing direct care for covid-19 patients , working with healthcare workers infected with novel coronavirus , visiting patients , or staying in the same close environment as a covid-19 patient \n\n - working together in close proximity or sharing the same classroom environment with a covid-19 patient \n\n - traveling together with a covid-19 patient in any kind of conveyance \n\n - living in the same household as a covid-19 patient \n\n trauma patients during the outbreak should be managed using the relevant contents in table 2 , and they should complete a brief epidemiological investigation at the triage stage . however , the trauma patients ' history may be unreliable , as they may not have time to be detailed . more emphasis should be placed on the objective data . during the outbreak in wuhan , a total of 32 emergency operations were performed in a tertiary care hospital , including 19 suspected and seven pathogenic confirmed cases . in addition , nine covid-19 patients in another tertiary care hospital underwent gastrointestinal surgery , but in all of these patients , covid-19 was diagnosed postoperatively . it is worth noting that there have been many cases of asymptomatic patients with an incubation period . the maximum incubation period was reported to be 24 days . \n\n evaluation \n\n trauma care is highly time dependent and requires rapid and effective evaluation and management . during the outbreak , primary and secondary surveys should be completed while maintaining the premise of effective protection . \n\n general principles of evaluation \n\n dynamic evaluation strategies should be conducted throughout the trauma care process . the personal protective equipment ( ppe ) worn by medical personnel may result in limited or incomplete physical examinations ( such as palpation and auscultation ) . therefore , injury assessment may rely on radiological examinations . \n\n radiology evaluation \n\n a chest ct scan is recommended for all severe trauma patients if there is no contraindication . if the chest ct scan is not possible due to critical condition , the patient should be treated as a suspect for infection until infection is excluded . \n\n level 3 ppe during ct examination \n\n if the hospital has a trauma resuscitation unit , complete x-ray including but not limited to the chest and focused assessment with sonography for trauma ( fast ) in the trauma resuscitation unit should be performed . for hemodynamic stabilization , a ct scan including but not limited to the chest should be performed ( fig . 1 ) . if the hospital does not have a trauma resuscitation unit , patients with hemodynamic instability should be resuscitated in the emergency department and undergo fast simultaneously . once the hemodynamic status is stable enough , the ct scan should be performed as soon as possible . \n\n ct scan protocol for trauma patients suspected of having covid-19 : medical personnel should first determine the method and scope of the scan , including but not limited to the chest , according to the mechanism of injury . for stab wounds , the segment and body cavity near the wound should be examined . for gunshot wounds , due to the high kinetic energy of the projectiles , the tortuous wound path , and the heavy tissue damage , the scanning range should be expanded appropriately . patients who have sustained blunt injuries with high energy , such as traffic injuries , should usually be scanned with enhanced scanning ranging from head to mid-thigh ( including the whole lower limb when there is lower limb injury ) . enhanced scanning is helpful in providing further information on organ injury , and three-dimensional reconstruction of blood vessels and bone should be performed when major vascular and bone injury is suspected . \n\n ct features of covid-19 : it should be noted that the pulmonary imaging changes of covid-19 vary depending on the patient 's age , immunity status , stage of disease at the time of the scan , underlying disease , and drug intervention . reports have shown that in the early stage of infection , ct shows multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes , which are obvious in the peripheral lung and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs . in severe cases , lung consolidation could occur . in addition , special attention should be paid to discerning between covid-19 infection and pulmonary contusion . \n\n blood and pathogen specimen collection \n\n if possible , nasopharyngeal swabs , sputum , lower respiratory tract secretions , and blood samples should be collected and sent for rrt-pcr in the emergency period . if no respiratory tract specimens are collected before the operation due to time constraints , they can be collected during or after the operation . \n\n all specimens shall be deemed to be potentially infectious . collection , transportation , and processing of any clinical specimens should be performed by biological safety training qualified medical staff . level 3 precautions should be adopted to minimize the possibility of exposure . \n\n the results of rrt-pcr may be falsely negative due to the influence of sampling , transportation , extraction , and testing . recent observations have shown that 30 to 40 % of patients with covid-19 ct features were rrt-pcr negative . as a result , the protection standard can not be lowered due to negative results . since the rrt-pcr test can take several hours to confirm the diagnosis , chest ct is recommended as the basis for the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 in suspected patients , especially in areas with a high incidence of the disease . the use of chest ct not only helps to control the spread of the epidemic but can also ensure definitive care for trauma injuries in a timely manner . \n\n emergency surgery \n\n emergency surgery is of great importance for severe trauma patients , the aim of which includes hemorrhage control , contamination abatement , and compartment pressure relief as soon as possible . effective prevention of sars-cov-2 transmission by standard intraoperative protective measures is an important indicator of a successful operation . from the available evidence , sars-cov-2 is spread mainly through respiratory droplets and contact , while aerosol and fecal-oral transmission are still under investigation . from the existing evidence and our practical experience , all medical staff should adopt level 3 precautions when entering the or . \n\n or preparation \n\n an independent negative pressure operation room is the first choice . operations can only be performed when the pressure is between - 10 and - 5 pa . if a negative pressure or is not available , a relatively isolated or with an independent purification system is an alternative option . nevertheless , the purification system should be shut down during the operation , and a final disinfection should be performed postoperatively . as in standard trauma protocols , the more critical patient should be operated on first . if two or more suspected or confirmed infected patients arrive in the or , a 30-min disinfection is warranted before the subsequent operation . the dedicated or should be clearly marked as covid-19 exclusive . \n\n the dedicated covid-19 or should be designed with a special passage and elevator . the design should focus on shortening the outdoor distance , reducing the chance of human contact , and limiting the time spent in suspected contaminated areas . materials and equipment should only be delivered by specially assigned staff . people inside the or are not allowed to leave during the operation , and outdoor personnel should not enter without permission . surgical articles should be clearly identified , and the use of disposable items is recommended . to maintain pressure , surgical supplies ( surgical instruments , dressings , single-use consumables , high-value consumables , medications , and relevant items ) should be well prepared in advance . only unidirectional flow is permitted ( nothing should be taken out once it is entered during the operation ) . personnel movement and the frequency of door opening are strictly limited . nondisposable items should be disposed of postoperatively in strict accordance with regulations . two suction apparatuses are optimal , one of which is for exclusive use by the anesthesiologist . the negative pressure aspirator should be immediately placed on the patient 's face to minimize the spread of respiratory secretions after entering the operation room . \n\n ppe for operation personnel \n\n protective clothing for surgical personnel : a after wearing protective clothing and inner gloves , b after wearing operating clothes and outer gloves \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe donning \n\n the topic of intraoperative protection remains controversial because most surgeons have no experience performing surgery while wearing heavy and airproof contagion gowns and goggles . according to practice in china , some medical personnel wore two surgical gowns , two contagion gowns and four pairs of gloves for surgery during the covid-19 epidemic . instead of enhancing protective effects , such excessive protection can reduce the visual , auditory , and tactile sensitivity of the surgeon , thus reducing the precision of surgical operations ( fig . 2 ) . the influence of excessive protection on the surgeon mainly includes ( 1 ) difficulty breathing , ( 2 ) fog on goggles and face shields that interfere with vision , ( 3 ) constriction of visual fields , ( 4 ) loss of flexibility due to multiple layers of gloves , and ( 5 ) double or triple the duration of the operation . a practical lesson had been learned from the case of a 7-year-old girl with suspected covid-19 infection who was subjected to an urgent craniotomy due to obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a third ventricle germ cell-derived tumor . the surgical team adopted a level 3 precaution including n95 respirators or papr , and full coverage with protective gowns ( shoe covers included ) and sterile surgical gowns . consequently , an operation that would have taken 2-3 h ended up taking 10 h. possible solutions for reducing the impact of ppe on surgery include reducing the or temperature ( minimizing the formation of moisture on goggles ) and enhancing the lighting in the room to obtain better vision . all ppes are fit for single use except papr . the steps of donning and doffing should be completed under professional supervision ( fig . 3 ) . \n\n anesthesia \n\n regional nerve block is the first choice for limb surgeries . general anesthesia is recommended for neurosurgery , torso trauma , or multiple trauma with shock . \n\n attention should be paid to avoid aerosol generation caused by coughing and other causes in airway operations . intubation should be performed after rapid induction and full muscle relaxation to ensure complete disappearance of spontaneous breathing , and sputum aspiration before intubation should be avoided . remote endotracheal intubation by disposable glide scope with an assistant is recommended . awake endotracheal intubation is not recommended for patients with a difficult airway , hypoxia , or unconsciousness . if face mask or laryngeal mask ventilation is able to maintain oxygenation , multiple tools ( fiberoptic bronchoscope , glide scope , light stick , laryngeal mask ) can be used to assist endotracheal intubation after rapid induction of general anesthesia . if not , cricothyroid laryngotomy should be performed without any hesitation . rapid induction via oral intubation is recommended in cases of a possibly full stomach . mask positive pressure ventilation after administration should be avoided . no emetic measure is recommended . extra caution should be taken on when a nasogastric tube is in place . covid-19 can cause pulmonary inflammation that can induce added lung injury , restricted crystal fluid , and protective ventilation . the proper mechanical ventilation parameters include limited tidal volume ( < 8 ml/kg ) and airway pressure ( platform pressure < 30 cm h2o ) ; 5-10 cm h2o positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation ( peep ) is optional for alveoli expansion and oxygenation maintenance . permissive hypercapnia is also acceptable . \n\n surgical strategy \n\n the concept of damage control surgery should be followed to simplify the operation . it is optimal to finish an operation within 90 min , and strategies such as packing hemostasis , external fixation , and temporary abdominal closure are helpful to shorten the operation time . surgical personnel should be highly focused and closely coordinated . gentle movement is essential to avoid accidental injury and contamination caused by the spattering of blood , fluid , and bone debris . limiting rinsing and drainage of bodily fluids is another key to effectively reducing intraoperative contamination . reliable hemostasis should be maintained to prevent bleeding around the incision . excessive negative pressure suction and violent operations are prohibited . it is also suggested that electrotome use is not suitable under this scenario ; if it must be used , the power should be minimized . smoke should be quickly suctioned to avoid aerosol generation . \n\n postoperative management \n\n postoperative management of patients \n\n after the operation , the patient should be transferred to an isolation ward in the icu . the endotracheal tubes should be removed under analgesia to avoid violent coughing while the patient is stable . sputum aspiration should be performed by a closed suction system . trauma and surgery can impair the patient 's immune function . clinically , some asymptomatic covid-19 patients suffered rapid deterioration after surgery . surgeons and anesthesiologists should be aware that acute lung injury caused by covid-19 may exist preoperatively or worsen postoperatively . therefore , special attention should be paid to the monitoring of body temperature , infection , and hemodynamic index . reexamination of chest ct and rrt-pcr tests is also important . for postoperative trauma patients with fever , traumatic , or operative complications should also be considered to differentiate them from covid-19 . attention should be paid to symptomatic and etiological treatment . postoperative dyspnea and hypoxia should also be differentiated from complications such as pulmonary embolism . nutritional support and prevention of other complications ( bacterial infection , stress ulcer , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , and deep venous thrombosis ) should also be strengthened . \n\n quarantine \n\n based on current experience , if the medical personnel complete the operation successfully and comply with all the regulations without any accidental exposure , the patient does not need to be quarantined . otherwise , a 14-day medical observation is obligatory , and timely treatment is needed when any abnormalities occur . notably , some literature recommends a routine 14-day quarantine for relevant personnel involved in the operation for sars-cov-2 confirmed patients . however , extreme safety often results in severe incapacity to help patients , so a balance between safety and efficiency must be maintained . \n\n discussion \n\n the national health commission of china initially decided to temporarily call the disease novel coronavirus pneumonia or ncp . it was not until february 12 , 2020 , that the official name covid-19 was announced by the who . shortly after the who announced the disease 's official name , the virus causing it was named sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , highlighting the new virus 's similarity to the sars virus identified in 2003 . based on epidemiological data up to jan. 4 , 2020 , the estimated r0 was 2.2 ( 95 % ci , 1.4 to 3.9 ) , while the latest study surveying cases up to feb. 14 , 2020 , further calculated that the r0 of covid-19 was 3.77 . therefore , researchers estimated that in terms of infection ability , sars-cov-2 was slightly higher than the sars virus and significantly higher than the mers-cov . according to clinical characteristic analysis of sars-cov-2 infection in china , the mortality was 2.01 % out of 28,018 cases as of feb. 6 , 2020 . by human-to-human transmission , sars-cov-2 had spread rapidly from wuhan , china , to 24 other countries as of feb. 12 , 2020 . the number of cases within china and other countries is rapidly increasing , and it is estimated that for every additional 10 % decrease in transmission rate , the peak population will be reduced by 20-47 % . the cumulative number of infected cases and deaths will be reduced by 23-49 % due to comprehensive interventions . if current interventions continue , it is expected that the number of people infected will peak in early march 2020 . based on the epidemiological analysis , only 1.18 % of the patients had direct contact with wild animals , 31.30 % of the patients had been in wuhan , and 71.80 % of the patients had contact with people from wuhan . common symptoms included fever , cough , and diarrhea . a total of 76.4 % of patients had radiologic findings manifested as pneumonia , with the remaining patients exhibiting normal radiologic findings . poor clinical outcomes can be predicted by disease severity , including oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count , and chest ct manifestations . \n\n the transmission by aerosols is still under investigation . aerosols are solid , liquid , solid , and liquid granular substances suspended in the air , such as dust , smoke , fog , and microorganisms . these may be the `` flying vehicles '' for covid-19 . covid-19 aerosols are related to the increased risk of covid-19 transmission . tracheal intubation , noninvasive ventilation , tracheotomy , manual ventilation before intubation , bronchoscopy , cardiopulmonary resuscitation , sputum suction , and other airway operations , as well as the use of electrotome , suction , and drainage , all inevitably produce a large number of aerosols . when carrying out these operations , the protection and training of medical personnel should be strengthened , and preventive measures to protect against aerosols are recommended , including n95 respirators , papr , goggles or face shields , disposable fluid-resistant gowns , and limiting the number of people in the room . \n\n based on experience from the hospital in wuhan , patients with covid-19 have high mortality after surgery . as of february 14 , 2020 , 6 gastrointestinal operations were performed in the general surgery department of the authors ' hospital ; one 60-year-old male died of respiratory failure 14 days after surgery , and one died of septic shock , for a mortality rate of 33.33 % . another group of eight covid-19 confirmed patients in zhongnan hospital of wuhan university underwent gastrointestinal surgeries ( seven gastrointestinal tumors and one benign case ) ; one patient died of covid-19 after left hemicolectomy with the diagnosis of postoperative recurrence of renal cancer involving the descending colon with intestinal obstruction , and one tumor patient died from postoperative complications of abdominal infection , for a mortality rate of 25 % . trauma patients usually have massive hemorrhage , shock , and contamination . damage control strategies should be complied with to correct fatal triads caused by hypothermia , acidosis , and coagulopathy . meanwhile , effective oxygen therapy and organ function support are also indispensable . \n\n moreover , additional attention should be paid to patients in critical condition and to those who develop severe pneumonia after trauma . among covid-19 patients , critical patients , including patients with respiratory failure , septic shock , and other organ failures , have accounted for 29 % ~32 % . identifying high-risk groups with severe illness can also help reduce the occurrence of poor prognosis . the possible high-risk groups include patients over 65 years old , patients with obesity , and patients with other diseases ( such as chronic pulmonary disease , hypertension , heart disease , kidney disease , diabetes , tumor , and immune deficiency ) . \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe doffing \n\n the covid-19 outbreak poses significant challenges to hospital staff and specifically trauma surgeons , which must offer optimal and timely care despite the circumstances . strict safety protocols must be adhered to when carrying out emergency care for patients with severe trauma and other surgical diseases , which means that all the measures shall be carried out to preserve the ability of the medical staff to achieve the purpose of effective care without sacrificing the safety of all involved . the perspectives in this paper can not be a substitute for clinical judgment and expert consultation but can help provide up-to-date guidance on the clinical management of emergency surgery for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 ( fig . 4 ) . \n\n conclusion \n\n in conclusion , the covid-19 outbreak raises several issues concerning the safety of medical personnel and patients . areas with high incidence rates of covid-19 should conduct operations with caution and protection should be strengthened while ensuring suitable facilities to carry out optimal care with maximal safety . with the accumulation of clinical experience and in-depth research , some of the practices may require modification when additional high-quality evidence emerges . the above is china 's experience in treating trauma patients during the covid-19 outbreak . we hope that this report will help hospitals worldwide prepare for future covid-19 outbreaks and infection control in unexpected conditions . \n\n abbreviations \n\n covid-19 \n\n corona virus disease \n\n sars-cov-2 \n\n severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \n\n

00001000	applications of 3d printing technology to address covid-19 related supply shortages \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) was first identified in an outbreak in wuhan , china on december 8 , 2019 . globally , the number of affected covid-19 patients is growing exponentially , with the death toll exceeding 27,300 as of march 27 , 2020 . worldwide , there is a limited supply of n95 respirator masks , face shields , ventilator valves , testing kits and other personal protective equipment . thus , adequate production and distribution of personal protective equipment is critical during this pandemic . to address these shortages , three-dimensional ( 3d ) printing , a novel and innovative technology used to fabricate complex architectures , is well suited . 3d printing is an adjustable , robotic platform allowing for tailored deposition of biomaterials using computer-aided design systems to formulate layer-by-layer custom designs with controlled architecture and composition . \n\n masks \n\n n95 respirators masks have two advantages over surgical , paper or cloth masks : 1 ) they are > 95 % efficient at filtering 0.3-microm airborne particles and 2 ) they are fit tested to each user to ensure an adequate seal , such that air and small droplets do not enter around the edges of the mask and into the health care worker 's breathing zone . the centers for disease control and prevention recommends n95 masks for health care workers taking care of patients with covid-19 . \n\n 3d printing can be used to produce tailored seal designs for improving mask comfort and fit . to customize face mask seals , 3d laser scanning can be implemented to scan exact facial parameters , with a tailored and customized face seal n95 template . anthropometric data of the chin arc , jawline , face and nose lengths , and nose protrusion measurements can be taken into account with this customized seal . in a study using face seal prototypes with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic using a fused deposition modeling 3d printer , three subjects showed improved contact pressure compared with use of 3m 8210 n95 ffr respirator masks . moreover , a personalized mask may account for facial hair length and density for a more precise fit . \n\n displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . the biomaterials displayed in this image have been fully characterized in the medical literature , with the same material composition of n95 masks . the mask includes several layers thereby ensure effective filtration of viral particles . \n\n figure 1 \n\n standard n95 masks consist of filtration material composed of electrostatic non-woven polypropylene ( pp ) fibers which are semi-rigid , lightweight and fatigue resistant . the semi-crystalline structure may cause significant distortion of the 3d printed parts upon cooling thereby making 3d printing difficult . material extrusion 3d printing was used to design a 3d printable thermoplastic elastomeric material from a blend of polypropylene ( pp ) and styrene- ( ethylene-butylene ) -styrene ( sebs ) . this blend provides better printability and flexibility for n95 mask design . pp is commonly used for various industrial applications due to its low cost , processability , printability , recyclability and mechanical integrity . sebs is a polymeric elastomer with low processing temperature and low distortion during extrusion . thus , the pp/sebs combination would improve the processability of 3d printed n95 masks . moreover , controlling the thermoplastic elastomer ratio allows for tailoring the flexibility and elasticity of the 3d model material for better fitted masks . 3d melt electrospinning printing can also be used to create pp microfibers with sequential layering to accurately obtain a 3d form . thus , 3d printing procedures may allow for the creation of stable and biocompatible n95 masks that are comparable to industrial manufacturing brands . figure 1 displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . \n\n face shields \n\n polycarbonate and polyester , polyvinyl chloride and other synthetic polymers are commonly used to make surgical face shields . these biomaterials are transparent , lightweight and provide high optical clarity . the polymers can easily be printed using 3d technology to meet the needs of healthcare workers treating covid-19 . \n\n covid-19 specimen collection kit \n\n creating 3d printed test swabs would help increase covid-19 testing capacity . nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs can be made from a flexible polymer , using polystyrene for the shaft . the tip can be tailored to be micro fine using computer-aided design software . thereafter , swab bud lattice fibers can be made from calcium alginate using hydrogels using 3d tissue engineering . \n\n ventilator valves \n\n ventilator valves are attachments used to deliver oxygen at fixed concentrations for patients with acute respiratory distress , including covid-19 patients . 3d printing technology can be used via a filament extrusion system or a polymer-laser powder bed fusion process to print single-use valve sets . 3d printers can design the different elements of the valve using biomaterials such as polyamide and polysulfone , polycarbonate , silicone rubber and stainless steel . furthermore , these disposable valves eliminate time-consuming sterilization . \n\n medications \n\n 3d printing techniques , such as fused filament , inkjet , extrusion and powder extrusion , allow for fabrication of 3d printed pills . medication-printing technologies typically utilize a small nozzle to lay thin disc-shaped layers of powders and deposit microscopic droplets of liquid to bind the materials . a coaxial needle extrusion 3d technology was used to print active pharmaceutical ingredients and create combinations of controlled dosing of drugs . while there are no specific antivirals or vaccines for treatment of covid-19 , several well-characterized anti-viral drugs are being considered as therapies . it may be possible to use 3d medication-printing technology to effectively and rapidly print lopinavir/ritonavir , chloroquine , and hydroxychloroquine pills . thus , 3d technology has the potential to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry , making drug research , development and production applicable to covid-19 patients . \n\n as the covid-19 outbreak rapidly evolves , there has been a personal protective equipment shortage globally . 3d printing inventions can be rapidly applied to address these deficiencies . cost , processing time , testing , and manpower are potential barriers to creating 3d-printed personal protective equipment . however , the synthetic polymer biomaterials needed for 3d-printed personal protective equipment are exact or very similar in composition to the standard manufacturing grade products ( i.e . n95 masks provides the same fluid barrier and air filtration protection ) . moreover , these synthetic polymer materials are readily available and cost effective ( i.e . polypropylene is 12.47 cents per pound ) . 3d printer costs vary but are an excellent investment with labor performed via robotics . in conjunction with flattening the curve via social distancing , this pioneering technology can provide adequate personal protective equipment for health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic . \n\n abbreviations : \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) \n\n three-dimensional ( 3d ) \n\n polypropylene ( pp ) \n\n

00010010	transmission potential of the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) onboard the diamond princess cruises ship , 2020 \n\n an outbreak of covid-19 developed aboard the princess cruises ship during january-february 2020 . using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members , we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak . our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore ( approximate range : 1.1-7 ) . our findings suggest that rt decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control . most recent estimates of rt reached values largely below the epidemic threshold , indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n introduction \n\n while the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) spread rapidly throughout china for several weeks since december 2019 , the virus had not taken off outside china in part due to the unprecedented social distancing measures that the chinese government put in place . one exception is the outbreak of covid-19 that developed aboard the diamond princess ship which was detected in early february when one of its passengers , a traveler from hong kong , tested positive for the novel coronavirus . the number of cases in the diamond princess ship quickly jumped to 454 confirmed cases by february 18 , 2020 . in contrast , the total number of cases in singapore , one of the countries with the highest number of covid-19 cases after china , was only 77 at the time . \n\n accumulating evidence indicates that the novel coronavirus can spread widely in confined settings including hospitals , cruise ships , prisons , and churches . in wuhan city , china , outbreaks inside health care settings led to the infection of hundreds of health professionals . in tokyo , japan , most of the reported infections have been linked to a party inside a traditional wooden ship , called yakatabune while most of the infections in korea have affected members of one church and one hospital . \n\n tracking the evolution of the transmission potential of covid-19 in different confined settings and how it compares with that of other respiratory diseases such influenza has public health implications . when outbreaks occur in confined settings , it is useful to investigate how the effective reproduction number changes as a result of interventions strategies such as the quarantine that the japanese government imposed on travelers and crew members aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n in this study we sought to characterize the temporal variation in the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak aboard the princess cruises ship using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data by dates of symptoms onset describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members . \n\n epidemiological incidence cases \n\n in yokohama , japan , an outbreak of covid-19 has been unfolding on board the princess cruise ship , which has been under quarantine orders since february 5 , 2020 , after a former passenger of the diamond princess ship tested positive for the virus after disembarking in hong kong . as of february 22 , 2020 , two days after the scheduled two-week quarantine came to an end , a total of 621 symptomatic and asymptomatic people including one quarantine officer , one nurse and one administrative officer tested positive for covid-19 out of the 3711 passengers and crew members on board . laboratory tests by pcr that prioritize symptomatic or high-risk groups have been conducted . \n\n incidence curves of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases of covid-19 among passengers and crew members of the outbreak unfolding aboard the princess cruises ship are publicly available from the national institute of infectious diseases , japan ( niid ) website . daily time series of symptomatic patients , from january 20 , 2020 to february 18 , 2020 were extracted . however , to reconstruct the trajectory of the epidemic , only 197 cases have dates of symptoms onset are available out of a total of 300 confirmed symptomatic cases . \n\n of the 103 symptomatic cases with missing onset dates , a total of the 79 cases are passengers while 24 cases are crew members . moreover , out of the 79 passenger cases , 30 cases were reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 21 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 28 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . of 24 crew member cases , 1 case was reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 15 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 8 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . \n\n epidemiological modeling \n\n we connected the daily incidence series with a discrete-time integral equation to describe the epidemic dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . specifically , let fs denote the probability mass function of the serial interval of covid-19 , where the serial interval is defined as the time from illness onset in the primary case to time of illness onset in the secondary case . then fs , of length s days , is given by \n\n for s > 0 , f ( s ) represents the cumulative distribution function of the gamma distribution . we characterized the expected number of new incident cases e [ ci , t ] in type i at symptom onset week t as follows , where rij denotes the average number of cases of type i infected by a single individual of type j . here we assume that the incidence , ci , t , follows a poisson sampling process with expected value e [ ci , t ] . \n\n the reproduction matrix for each type is given by \n\n this matrix is referred to as a next-generation matrix ( ngm ) in a fully susceptible population ( , pp . 873-885 ) . using this matrix , we derive the instantaneous time-dependent effective reproduction number , rt , for the entire transmission dynamics from the largest eigenvalue of the ngm . under the assumption that the per-contact infection probability and the generation interval are consistent over time regardless of the type of infection , the ngm quantifies the within type and inter-type patterns of transmission . the sum of the value in column j is the reproduction number for a specific type j . \n\n serial interval estimates of covid-19 were derived from previous studies of covid-19 , indicating that it follows a gamma distribution with the mean and sd at 7.5 and 3.4 days , respectively , based on ref .. the maximum value of the serial interval was fixed at 20 days as the cumulative probability distribution of the gamma distribution up to 20 days reaches 0.991 . \n\n we estimated model parameters and made projections using a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) method in a bayesian framework . point estimates and corresponding 95 % credibility intervals were drawn from the posterior probability distribution . all statistical analyses were conducted in r version 3.5.2 ( r foundation for statistical computing , vienna , austria ) and the 'rstan ' package ( no-u-turn-sampler ( nuts ) ) ( see table 1 ) . \n\n result \n\n day date event 1 jan/20/2020 departed from the

credibility intervals ( cri ) . \n\n total transmission includes within-type and inter-type transmission . \n\n our latest estimate of the overall rt is 0.35 ( 95 % cri : 0.02 , 2.19 ) , with only 2 % of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 . passenger and crew also have total ( within-type and inter-type ) rt values largely below the epidemic threshold , with only small percentages at 0 % and 9 % above the epidemic threshold , respectively ( table 3 ) . \n\n discussion \n\n this is the first study to assess the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak that unfolded aboard the diamond princess ship , january-february 2020 . the overall mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore in the range 1.1-7 . however , following the implementation of the quarantine period , the overall rt decreased substantially compared to values estimated during the early stage , but it exhibited fluctuations around the epidemic threshold , which likely prolonged the outbreak . \n\n our results indicate that rt declined following the quarantine measures implemented by the japanese government on february 5 relative to values during the early phase of the outbreak . importantly , only those passengers and crew who tested positive for the novel coronavirus were permitted to disembark the diamond princess ship , with more than 80 percentage of the passengers and crews still on board as of february 18 , 2020 . our latest overall estimate of rt at 0.35 ( 95 % cri : 0.02 , 2.19 ) with only 2 % of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 suggested a low probability of observing a subsequent outbreak aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n our findings indicate that the passenger-to-passenger transmission type dominated the transmission dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . the rapid increase in the overall rt from day 12 ( january 31 , 2020 ) to day 19 ( february 7 , 2020 ) is greatly influenced by the increase in passenger-to-passenger transmission , and this time period covers the time lag between february 1 , 2020 when the index covid-19 case was reported and february 5 , 2020 when the japanese government requested the passengers to stay inside their cabin after the detection of a cluster of covid-19 positive cases . upon the implementation of the quarantine orders , the overall rt and rt for passengers aboard the diamond princess ship declined thereafter , while rt among crew maintained a steady level and only started to decline on day 25 of the outbreak ( february 13 , 2020 ) . this is consistent with the fact that passengers staying inside their cabins led to a substantial decline in passenger-to-passenger transmission type except for their interaction with cabin mates . indeed , the proportion of secondary infections inside the cabins increased from 7 % ( 1/15 ) on february 6 , 43 % ( 3/7 ) on february 10 , 2020 to 100 % ( 1/1 ) on february 14 , 2020 . thus , a high proportion of the symptomatic cases after the quarantine gradually shifted from largely passenger cases to crew cases . indeed , despite their potential risk of acquiring the infection , crews had to continue to work to deliver services to isolated passengers . the distribution of the median re by transmission type suggests that other transmission types likely contributed to this outbreak to some extent ( fig . 3 ) . because one quarantine officer , one nurse , and one administrative officer contracted covid-19 aboard the diamond princess ship , the infection risk continued to be significant inside the diamond princess ship . \n\n as for the crude asymptomatic ratios by age groups , they show significant differences across age groups . however , these crude ratios are severely influenced by the timing of specimen collection relative to the infection time . hence , these ratios could be better ascertained if additional data with the timing of specimen collection becomes available . \n\n several limitations should be listed . first , a total of 103 laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases with unknown onset dates were not incorporated in our analysis . although the high proportion of unavailable data ( 34 % ( 103/300 ) ) likely influenced a downward bias in estimates of transmission potential , our estimates still point to the high transmission potential of covid-19 inside confined settings . second , it is possible that reporting delays could have influenced our latest estimates of the effective reproduction number . in fact , the us government recently sent a chartered flight to transport the american passengers on board the diamond princess ship , and after the disembarkation process , a total of 14 american passengers tested positive for the disease on february 16 , 2020 . this event also contributes to a downward bias in r although the number of cases does not exceed the peak of the outbreak , further supporting the potent transmissibility of covid-19 in confined settings . \n\n our most recent estimate of the effective reproduction number of the ongoing covid-19 epidemic on board the diamond princess ship was largely below the epidemic threshold of 1.0 , which suggested a very low probability of observing secondary outbreaks of the disease in the diamond princess ship . \n\n funding statement \n\n km acknowledges support from the japan society for the promotion of science kakenhi grant number 18k17368 and from

00001000	contact transmission of covid-19 in south korea : novel investigation techniques for tracing contacts \n\n in the epidemiological investigation of an infectious disease , investigating , classifying , tracking , and managing contacts by identifying the patient 's route are important for preventing further transmission of the disease . however , omissions and errors in previous activities can occur when the investigation is performed through only a proxy interview with the patient . to overcome these limitations , methods that can objectively verify the patient 's claims ( medical facility records , global positioning system , card transactions , and closed-circuit television ) were used for the recent ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 contact investigations in south korea . \n\n introduction \n\n an epidemiological investigation aims to quickly determine the prevalence of an infectious disease whilst simultaneously revealing the cause , and source of the disease , and explore the transmission process to ultimately prevent the spread of the infectious disease . as individuals become the source of the infectious disease , and if person-to-person transmission is suspected , it is important to immediately identify , and manage people that are in close contact with suspected patients . in particular , if there are several unknown epidemiological and clinical characteristics , and an effective medical intervention is lacking ( as in the case of new infectious diseases such as covid-19 ) , contact management becomes 1 of the core strategies to minimize additional transmission . for these strategies to be successful , it is necessary to evaluate between-person exposure risk in all locations where there have been confirmed cases ( after the onset of symptoms ) , and to classify contact persons based on this risk . furthermore , it is also important to eliminate the possibility of exposure to infection in the places visited by the confirmed patient , by performing the appropriate disinfection of areas that can harbor environmental contamination . however , traditional investigative methods , depending on the patient or proxy interview , has the limitation of omissions and errors of previous activities . \n\n the covid-19 outbreak in china occurred on december 8th , 2019 , and the first case in korea was reported on january 20th , 2020 . as of february 14th , the total number of confirmed cases of covid-19 in korea was 28 . in the current epidemiological investigation contact investigation techniques that were used on a limited basis for the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) outbreak in 2015 , are being used in all confirmed cases of covid-19 . \n\n this report will provide a general overview of the contact investigation from the covid-19 national emergency response center , epidemiology and case management team and describe the various methods used to evaluate exposure risk . \n\n results \n\n covid-19 contact investigation and management comprised of the following : 1 ) determination of the location of the contact ( patient route ) , 2 ) exposure risk evaluation , 3 ) contact classification , and 4 ) contact management . the location of the contact was determined through the process of preliminary identification , by interviewing patients , and their acquaintances , and by objective verification of the investigated information . exposure risk evaluation was performed depending on the route of disease transmission , patient characteristics , and environmental characteristics . based on the results of the evaluation , the contacts were classified into close and casual contacts depending on the exposure . the method of managing the classified contacts was largely distinguished between movement restriction and symptom monitoring . movement restriction is a legal public health order , and quarantine ( isolation ) , home isolation , or controlled travel is enacted . symptom monitoring was performed as either active or passive monitoring , depending on the exposure risk ( figure 1 ) . \n\n the methods used to overcome recall and confirmation biases that can occur while determining the location of the contact include checking medical facilities records , phone-based global positioning system ( gps ) , card transaction records , and closed-circuit television ( cctv ; table 1 ) . \n\n 1 . history of using medical facilities and visiting pharmacies \n\n history of using medical facilities , and visiting pharmacies was used to estimate the window of time of infection , through an accurate evaluation of the clinical symptoms of the infectious disease , and initial onset of the symptoms . if a medical facility was included in the patient 's route , quarantine of the medical facility was conducted . \n\n 2 . gps \n\n consistency in the recall of the route of the patients identified through interview was evaluated . additionally , identification of the routes that the patient could not remember was also possible . however , another person 's information can be misunderstood as the patient 's information if the phone is not owned by or carried by the patient . gps uses cellular phone networks , therefore there are limitations in identifying the exact locations of a patient 's route . \n\n 3. credit card transaction log \n\n credit card transaction logs were used to assess the consistency in the route of the patient identified through interview , and the scope of contacts was assessed by specifying the locations visited . however , if the patient did not use a credit card under their name or if another person used the patient 's card , the information may be misinterpreted . thus , rechecking the contents of the credit card log was necessary , and instances of not being able to use the information at the appropriate time may occur . \n\n 4 . cctv \n\n by checking the video footage of the location of a patient 's path , cctv provided help to identify the details of each situation . for example , cctv was used to evaluate the level of exposure risk by identifying whether the patient wore masks , or had respiratory symptoms such as a cough . the limitations of using cctv were the lengthy time required to check the cctv , and the accuracy of patient identification if the cctv was not inside the facility or the patient was in a blind spot of the camera . \n\n discussion \n\n based on the experience of the mers outbreak in 2015 , laws were revised to supplement the areas that were lacking at the time . korea centers for disease control and prevention were able to use relevant information in epidemiological investigations to contain and prevent infection , thus enabling the establishment of a more comprehensive management of infectious diseases . furthermore , making accurate information available to the general public helps to minimize fear and confusion with respect to the risk of transmissibility of the disease . the use of methods that have objectively verified the patient 's route claims ( medical facility records , gps , card transactions , and cctv ) for covid-19 contact investigations in south korea has provided accurate information on the location , and time of exposure , and details of the situation , thus reducing omissions in a patient 's route due to recall or confirmation bias that may have arisen from patient or proxy interviews . \n\n however , the publicization of a patient 's route for the public 's benefit infringes upon the privacy of the patient . thus , it is necessary to establish a protocol to protect privacy . equally , more effort should be taken to provide accurate information to the public . patient information that is unrelated to the communication of risk of infectious diseases must be protected by clearly defining the standards of publicization and reporting of patient information for the public 's benefit when an infectious disease is prevalent . \n\n with regards to responding to the recent prevalence of covid-19 , korea centers for disease control and prevention are performing defense activities to contain and prevent infection at the appropriate time , with more objective and accurate methods for monitoring patient contacts by using personal information . however , an evaluation of the effectiveness of these monitoring methods when multiple patients are involved , is necessary after the situation has been controlled . epidemiological investigations require the collaboration of various related persons and must be conducted through a strict verification process . furthermore , investigations must be performed using systematic processes with scientific methods and principles , and cycles of continuous evaluation and feedback to identify the etiology , extent , progression and therapy for the infectious disease and the development of public health policies . \n\n conflicts of interest \n\n the authors declare no competing

00001000	strategic planning to augment the testing capacity for covid-19 in india . \n\n background & objectives : nearly 5,500 tests for coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) had been conducted on march 31 , 2020 across the indian council of medical research ( icmr ) -approved public and private laboratories in india . given the need to rapidly increase testing coverage , we undertook an exercise to explore and quantify interventions to increase the daily real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qrt-pcr ) -based testing capacity over the next few months . the objective of this exercise was to prepare a potential plan to scale-up covid-19 testing in india in the public sector . methods : potential increase in daily testing capacity of the existing public laboratories was calculated across the three base scenarios of shifts ( 9 , 16 and 24 h ) . additional testing capacity was added for each shift scenario based on interventions ranging from procurement of additional qrt-pcr machines , leveraging spare capacity on available qrt-pcr machines not drafted into covid-19 testing , to in-laboratory process optimization efforts . results : moving to a 24 h working model in the existing approved laboratories can enhance the daily testing capacity to 40,464 tests/day . the capacity can be further bolstered by leveraging qrt-pcr and nucleic acid amplification test ( naat ) -based machines available with the multidisciplinary research units ( mrus ) , national aids control organisation ( naco ) and national tuberculosis elimination programme ( ntep ) . using combination/multiplex kits , and provision of automated rna extraction platforms at all laboratories could also optimize run time and contribute to capacity increase by 1.5-2 times . interpretation & conclusions : adopting these interventions could help increase public sector 's daily testing capacity to nearly 100,000-120,000 tests/day . it is important to note that utilization of the scaled-up testing capacity will require deployment of additional workforce , procurement of corresponding commodities for testing and scale-up of sample collection and transportation efforts . 
00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine

are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu

causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the

00001000	role of mask/respirator protection against sars-cov-2 \n\n to the editor \n\n since its outbreak on december 31 , 2019 , in wuhan , a central city in china , coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) has now spread to almost all countries in the world . it has been declared a pandemic , and it has infected over 1,041,126 people in a very short time , with 55,132 deaths as ofapril 3 , 2020 . wearing masks/respirators and practicingself-isolation at home have been recommended as guidelines for thepublic . however , the problem is the number of cases among medical personnel . interestingly , a higher risk of infection was noticed in male professionals . there are currently many types of masks/respirators available , ranging from simple surgical masks designed to protect wearers from microorganism transmission and fit loosely to the user 's face , through n95 masks used to prevent users from inhaling small airborne particles . these must fit tightly to the user 's face . masks differ primarily in their maximum internal leakage rate limit . surgical masks are designed to protect against droplets or particles with a diameter of > 100 mum , whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) virus is essentially spherical , albeit slightly pleomorphic , with a diameter of 60-140 nm and 100 times smaller than the pore diameter . thus , surgical masks can not prevent inhalation of small airborne particles ; however , both can protect users from large droplets and sprays . the pn-en 149:2001 standard defines 3 protection classes for half masks : filtering face piece 1 ( ffp1 ) , filtering face piece 2 ( ffp2 ) , and filtering face piece 3 ( ffp3 ) . the maximum internal leakage limit is 25 % for ffp1 , 11 % for ffp2 , and 5 % for ffp3 . class ffp1 masks retain about 80 % of particles smaller than 2 mum , ffp2 ones retain 94 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum , and ffp3 ones retain 99.95 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum ( table ) . \n\n test ffp1 ffp2 ffp3 concentration of harmful substances till 4 x nds till 10 x nds till 30 x nds leakage < 22 % < 8 % < 2 % penetration < 20 % < 6 % < 1 % initial expiration resistance at 95 l/min < 210 pa < 240 pa < 300 pa \n\n filtration efficiency for each class of masks \n\n abbreviations : ffp1 , filtering face piece 1 ; ffp2 , filtering face piece 2 ; ffp3 , filtering face piece 3 ; nds , the highest acceptable concentration of the harmful factor . \n\n at the moment , we may meet divergent recommendations for the use of masks . while the centers for disease control and prevention recommend the use of masks in low-risk and high-risk situations , the world health organization advises applying masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations . long et al conclude in their meta-analysis that the use of n95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza . they suggest that n95 respirators should not be recommended for the general public and non-high-risk medical staff who are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients . \n\n the potential of face masks to reduce the spread of respiratory infections could be useful . wang et al indicated that 10 of 213 medical professionals with no mask were infected by covid-19 as compared with 0 of 278 wearing n95 respirators . \n\n it is also worth noting that the respirator increases resistance to inhalation . the longer they are used , the more difficult breathing becomes because of more absorbed dust . what is more , the effectiveness decreases with the increase of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the respirator and face ( the so-called dead space ) . the concentration of carbon dioxide in the dead space increases with each subsequent exhalation . therefore , masks should be replaced frequently . additionally , to improve the comfort of use , masks use 1-way exhalation valves , which accelerate the circulation of gases.6 \n\n to conclude , the use of protective masks can and should be the first protection against sars-cov-2 transmission to medical personnel . medical personnel should use class ffp3 masks . additionally , the application of visors to cover the entire face during contact with the patient is worth considering . \n\n references \n\n association between 2019-ncov transmission and n95 respirator use . \n\n comparison of performance of three different types of respiratory protection devices . \n\n protecting healthcare staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome : filtration capacity of multiple surgical masks . \n\n a close shave ? performance of p2/n95 respirators in health care workers with facial hair : results of the beards ( adequate respiratory defences ) study . \n\n effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza : a systematic review and meta-analysis . \n\n cloth masks versus medical masks for covid-19 . 
00001000	emergency trauma care during the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in china \n\n background \n\n a novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in wuhan , hubei province , in december 2019 ; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans . china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease . however , a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking . to regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak , we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in wuhan . \n\n main body \n\n the article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 , indications for emergency surgery , and infection prevention and control for medical personnel , providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period . \n\n conclusions \n\n the measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of covid-19 . \n\n background \n\n a novel corona virus disease ( covid-19 ) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) began in wuhan , hubei province , china , in december 2019 . by february 13 , 2020 , more than 60,000 cases were confirmed , nearly 50,000 in hubei alone , and the source of the infection was yet to be definitely determined . the world health organization ( who ) has declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) . considering the current rate of human to human transmission , most countries in the world should be well prepared for the potential global covid-19 pandemic . china is on the frontline in the fight against the virus , and medical staff have become exhausted due to the excessive workload brought on by the outbreak . medical testing tools and personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , such as face shields , goggles , and gloves , have become scarce and have had to be rationed among teams and medical centers , with severe shortage in hubei , the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak . a report from a neurosurgery department of a teaching hospital in wuhan showed that from december 25 , 2019 , to february 6 , 2020 , eight covid-19 suspected patients were admitted , and three were confirmed . consequently , 12 medical personnel were infected ( 11 nurses and one doctor ) , among whom three had been in close contact with the first confirmed case . according to the data released by the national health commission ( nhc ) of the people 's republic of china , a total of 1716 medical personnel infections had been reported nationwide , accounting for 3.8 % of the total confirmed cases by 24:00 on february 11 , 2020 , of which six ( 0.4 % ) had died . of these , hubei province reported 1502 cases , accounting for 87.5 % of the total medical personnel infections , while wuhan city reported 1102 cases , accounting for 73.4 % . notably , medical personnel are the most valuable resource during the outbreak . how to protect them from infection is one of the foremost challenges in the fight against sars-cov-2 . \n\n although china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of sars-cov-2 , severe trauma can still occur . during the outbreak , the population of trauma patients may be diverse in terms of infection status , including patients who were previously healthy , suspected to be infected , confirmed infected , close contacts of infected individuals , and asymptomatic carriers . thus , balancing optimal trauma care while preventing further spread of the viral infection during the outbreak is a major challenge . \n\n to our knowledge , there is no relevant consensus or clinical guideline available on the indications of , timing of or perioperative protection during emergency surgery for trauma . to protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of trauma care , we have summarized the recommended perioperative infection prevention and control measures for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 based on current practical experience in china and the published literature on surgical practice during the past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) , ebola virus , and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n main text \n\n general principles \n\n special requirements for the hospitals receiving trauma patients during the outbreak \n\n emergency department : set up a triage area for assessment of all patients at admission , allowing early recognition of possible sars-cov-2 infection and immediate isolation of patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection in an area separate from other patients . \n\n radiology department : a dedicated ct room should be kept on standby for the examination of infected patients . \n\n operating room ( or ) : a relatively isolated negative-pressure or is preferable ; if there is no permanent negative-pressure or , a temporarily modified negative-pressure or the main operating suite of the hospital can be converted . \n\n intensive care unit ( icu ) : an isolated area should be prepared in the icu , and suspected patients should be treated in a single space . \n\n intrahospital transport : although an ideal trauma center with a door-to-door ct room and negative-pressure or are preferable in this situation , most regions in china do not operate such facilities . therefore , a predetermined transport route should be used to minimize exposure , and any intrahospital transport should utilize dedicated carts demarcated by a warning logo equipped with protective supplies and hand disinfectants . the patient should wear a medical mask , and the walls and the floor of the passageways and the elevator should be covered with a plastic lining . \n\n to control the spread of covid-19 , basic principles for treating infectious diseases should be followed , and necessary measures should be taken before receiving trauma patients . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n precaution level applicable personnel and scenarios personal protective equipment level 1 triage , emergency department clean non-sterile long gown , disposable head cover , disposable medical mask , and gloves . level 2 close contact with suspected patients , or handling secretions , feces , and personal items belonging to patients ; performing ct scan ( fig . 1 ) disposable head cover , gloves , disposable coverall , n95 respirator or equivalent , goggle or face shield , rubber boots or fluid-resistant overshoes , etc . level 3 close contact with suspected patients , or collecting blood , respiratory tract samples of patients , especially for endotracheal intubation , airway care , and sputum suction , as well as emergency surgery ( fig . 2 ) . on the basis of wearing secondary protective equipment such as goggle or face shield , other protective equipment should be strengthened . for instance , adding disposable surgical clothing and gloves in addition to disposable coverall and gloves . two layers of gloves covering protective clothing and surgical clothes sleeves , respectively , use of a powered air purifying respirator ( papr ) . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n to standardize and simplify the precaution measures and equipment required for different personnel and scenarios in trauma care , we adopted a three-level precaution protocol in trauma care ( table 1 ) . \n\n all levels of precaution were based on implementing standard precautions , including hand hygiene , respiratory hygiene , and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment ( ppe ) according to different risk levels . proper training of the standard donning and doffing procedures is the basis of effective protection . in epidemic areas such as hubei province , all patients can be regarded as potentially suspected patients during the outbreak , and the level of the precaution should be elevated . \n\n triage \n\n classification of the patients suspected cases clinical confirmed cases ( hubei only ) pathogenic confirmed cases diagnostic basis outside hubei province : two of the clinical manifestations with at least one of the epidemiological histories , three of the clinical manifestations without epidemiological history suspected patient in hubei province with ct findings of pneumonia suspected or clinically confirmed patients with at least one pathogenic evidence epidemiological investigation 1 . travel to or residence in wuhan in the 14 days prior to symptom onset ; 2 . close contactb with sars-cov-2 infection ( rrt-pcr positive ) within 14 days before onset ; 3 . exposed to patients from wuhan and surrounding areas , or from a community with patients who reported fever or respiratory symptoms14 d before onset ; 4 . clustering outbreak . - - clinical manifestations and ct scan 1 . fever and/or respiratory symptoms ; 2 . imaging characteristics of covid-19 ( ct : multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes in early stage , which are obvious in the peripheral lung , and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs , and lung consolidation may occur in severe cases ) ; 3 . the total number of white blood cells in the early stage is normal or decreased , and the lymphocyte count is decreased - - pathogenic evidence null null 1 . detection of sars-cov-2 in respiratory specimens and sera by rrt-pcr assays ; 2 . by virus dna sequencing , respiratory or blood samples dna sequence highly homologous with sars-cov-2 . \n\n diagnostic criteria of covid-19a \n\n covid-19 coronavirus induced disease , sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 , rrt-pcr real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \n\n athe diagnostic criteria were defined according to guidance for the diagnosis and management for covid-19 ( 5th edition ) released by national health commission of people 's republic of china in feb. 4 , 2020 \n\n bclose contact is defined as follows : \n\n - healthcare-associated exposure , including providing direct care for covid-19 patients , working with healthcare workers infected with novel coronavirus , visiting patients , or staying in the same close environment as a covid-19 patient \n\n - working together in close proximity or sharing the same classroom environment with a covid-19 patient \n\n - traveling together with a covid-19 patient in any kind of conveyance \n\n - living in the same household as a covid-19 patient \n\n trauma patients during the outbreak should be managed using the relevant contents in table 2 , and they should complete a brief epidemiological investigation at the triage stage . however , the trauma patients ' history may be unreliable , as they may not have time to be detailed . more emphasis should be placed on the objective data . during the outbreak in wuhan , a total of 32 emergency operations were performed in a tertiary care hospital , including 19 suspected and seven pathogenic confirmed cases . in addition , nine covid-19 patients in another tertiary care hospital underwent gastrointestinal surgery , but in all of these patients , covid-19 was diagnosed postoperatively . it is worth noting that there have been many cases of asymptomatic patients with an incubation period . the maximum incubation period was reported to be 24 days . \n\n evaluation \n\n trauma care is highly time dependent and requires rapid and effective evaluation and management . during the outbreak , primary and secondary surveys should be completed while maintaining the premise of effective protection . \n\n general principles of evaluation \n\n dynamic evaluation strategies should be conducted throughout the trauma care process . the personal protective equipment ( ppe ) worn by medical personnel may result in limited or incomplete physical examinations ( such as palpation and auscultation ) . therefore , injury assessment may rely on radiological examinations . \n\n radiology evaluation \n\n a chest ct scan is recommended for all severe trauma patients if there is no contraindication . if the chest ct scan is not possible due to critical condition , the patient should be treated as a suspect for infection until infection is excluded . \n\n level 3 ppe during ct examination \n\n if the hospital has a trauma resuscitation unit , complete x-ray including but not limited to the chest and focused assessment with sonography for trauma ( fast ) in the trauma resuscitation unit should be performed . for hemodynamic stabilization , a ct scan including but not limited to the chest should be performed ( fig . 1 ) . if the hospital does not have a trauma resuscitation unit , patients with hemodynamic instability should be resuscitated in the emergency department and undergo fast simultaneously . once the hemodynamic status is stable enough , the ct scan should be performed as soon as possible . \n\n ct scan protocol for trauma patients suspected of having covid-19 : medical personnel should first determine the method and scope of the scan , including but not limited to the chest , according to the mechanism of injury . for stab wounds , the segment and body cavity near the wound should be examined . for gunshot wounds , due to the high kinetic energy of the projectiles , the tortuous wound path , and the heavy tissue damage , the scanning range should be expanded appropriately . patients who have sustained blunt injuries with high energy , such as traffic injuries , should usually be scanned with enhanced scanning ranging from head to mid-thigh ( including the whole lower limb when there is lower limb injury ) . enhanced scanning is helpful in providing further information on organ injury , and three-dimensional reconstruction of blood vessels and bone should be performed when major vascular and bone injury is suspected . \n\n ct features of covid-19 : it should be noted that the pulmonary imaging changes of covid-19 vary depending on the patient 's age , immunity status , stage of disease at the time of the scan , underlying disease , and drug intervention . reports have shown that in the early stage of infection , ct shows multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes , which are obvious in the peripheral lung and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs . in severe cases , lung consolidation could occur . in addition , special attention should be paid to discerning between covid-19 infection and pulmonary contusion . \n\n blood and pathogen specimen collection \n\n if possible , nasopharyngeal swabs , sputum , lower respiratory tract secretions , and blood samples should be collected and sent for rrt-pcr in the emergency period . if no respiratory tract specimens are collected before the operation due to time constraints , they can be collected during or after the operation . \n\n all specimens shall be deemed to be potentially infectious . collection , transportation , and processing of any clinical specimens should be performed by biological safety training qualified medical staff . level 3 precautions should be adopted to minimize the possibility of exposure . \n\n the results of rrt-pcr may be falsely negative due to the influence of sampling , transportation , extraction , and testing . recent observations have shown that 30 to 40 % of patients with covid-19 ct features were rrt-pcr negative . as a result , the protection standard can not be lowered due to negative results . since the rrt-pcr test can take several hours to confirm the diagnosis , chest ct is recommended as the basis for the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 in suspected patients , especially in areas with a high incidence of the disease . the use of chest ct not only helps to control the spread of the epidemic but can also ensure definitive care for trauma injuries in a timely manner . \n\n emergency surgery \n\n emergency surgery is of great importance for severe trauma patients , the aim of which includes hemorrhage control , contamination abatement , and compartment pressure relief as soon as possible . effective prevention of sars-cov-2 transmission by standard intraoperative protective measures is an important indicator of a successful operation . from the available evidence , sars-cov-2 is spread mainly through respiratory droplets and contact , while aerosol and fecal-oral transmission are still under investigation . from the existing evidence and our practical experience , all medical staff should adopt level 3 precautions when entering the or . \n\n or preparation \n\n an independent negative pressure operation room is the first choice . operations can only be performed when the pressure is between - 10 and - 5 pa . if a negative pressure or is not available , a relatively isolated or with an independent purification system is an alternative option . nevertheless , the purification system should be shut down during the operation , and a final disinfection should be performed postoperatively . as in standard trauma protocols , the more critical patient should be operated on first . if two or more suspected or confirmed infected patients arrive in the or , a 30-min disinfection is warranted before the subsequent operation . the dedicated or should be clearly marked as covid-19 exclusive . \n\n the dedicated covid-19 or should be designed with a special passage and elevator . the design should focus on shortening the outdoor distance , reducing the chance of human contact , and limiting the time spent in suspected contaminated areas . materials and equipment should only be delivered by specially assigned staff . people inside the or are not allowed to leave during the operation , and outdoor personnel should not enter without permission . surgical articles should be clearly identified , and the use of disposable items is recommended . to maintain pressure , surgical supplies ( surgical instruments , dressings , single-use consumables , high-value consumables , medications , and relevant items ) should be well prepared in advance . only unidirectional flow is permitted ( nothing should be taken out once it is entered during the operation ) . personnel movement and the frequency of door opening are strictly limited . nondisposable items should be disposed of postoperatively in strict accordance with regulations . two suction apparatuses are optimal , one of which is for exclusive use by the anesthesiologist . the negative pressure aspirator should be immediately placed on the patient 's face to minimize the spread of respiratory secretions after entering the operation room . \n\n ppe for operation personnel \n\n protective clothing for surgical personnel : a after wearing protective clothing and inner gloves , b after wearing operating clothes and outer gloves \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe donning \n\n the topic of intraoperative protection remains controversial because most surgeons have no experience performing surgery while wearing heavy and airproof contagion gowns and goggles . according to practice in china , some medical personnel wore two surgical gowns , two contagion gowns and four pairs of gloves for surgery during the covid-19 epidemic . instead of enhancing protective effects , such excessive protection can reduce the visual , auditory , and tactile sensitivity of the surgeon , thus reducing the precision of surgical operations ( fig . 2 ) . the influence of excessive protection on the surgeon mainly includes ( 1 ) difficulty breathing , ( 2 ) fog on goggles and face shields that interfere with vision , ( 3 ) constriction of visual fields , ( 4 ) loss of flexibility due to multiple layers of gloves , and ( 5 ) double or triple the duration of the operation . a practical lesson had been learned from the case of a 7-year-old girl with suspected covid-19 infection who was subjected to an urgent craniotomy due to obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a third ventricle germ cell-derived tumor . the surgical team adopted a level 3 precaution including n95 respirators or papr , and full coverage with protective gowns ( shoe covers included ) and sterile surgical gowns . consequently , an operation that would have taken 2-3 h ended up taking 10 h. possible solutions for reducing the impact of ppe on surgery include reducing the or temperature ( minimizing the formation of moisture on goggles ) and enhancing the lighting in the room to obtain better vision . all ppes are fit for single use except papr . the steps of donning and doffing should be completed under professional supervision ( fig . 3 ) . \n\n anesthesia \n\n regional nerve block is the first choice for limb surgeries . general anesthesia is recommended for neurosurgery , torso trauma , or multiple trauma with shock . \n\n attention should be paid to avoid aerosol generation caused by coughing and other causes in airway operations . intubation should be performed after rapid induction and full muscle relaxation to ensure complete disappearance of spontaneous breathing , and sputum aspiration before intubation should be avoided . remote endotracheal intubation by disposable glide scope with an assistant is recommended . awake endotracheal intubation is not recommended for patients with a difficult airway , hypoxia , or unconsciousness . if face mask or laryngeal mask ventilation is able to maintain oxygenation , multiple tools ( fiberoptic bronchoscope , glide scope , light stick , laryngeal mask ) can be used to assist endotracheal intubation after rapid induction of general anesthesia . if not , cricothyroid laryngotomy should be performed without any hesitation . rapid induction via oral intubation is recommended in cases of a possibly full stomach . mask positive pressure ventilation after administration should be avoided . no emetic measure is recommended . extra caution should be taken on when a nasogastric tube is in place . covid-19 can cause pulmonary inflammation that can induce added lung injury , restricted crystal fluid , and protective ventilation . the proper mechanical ventilation parameters include limited tidal volume ( < 8 ml/kg ) and airway pressure ( platform pressure < 30 cm h2o ) ; 5-10 cm h2o positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation ( peep ) is optional for alveoli expansion and oxygenation maintenance . permissive hypercapnia is also acceptable . \n\n surgical strategy \n\n the concept of damage control surgery should be followed to simplify the operation . it is optimal to finish an operation within 90 min , and strategies such as packing hemostasis , external fixation , and temporary abdominal closure are helpful to shorten the operation time . surgical personnel should be highly focused and closely coordinated . gentle movement is essential to avoid accidental injury and contamination caused by the spattering of blood , fluid , and bone debris . limiting rinsing and drainage of bodily fluids is another key to effectively reducing intraoperative contamination . reliable hemostasis should be maintained to prevent bleeding around the incision . excessive negative pressure suction and violent operations are prohibited . it is also suggested that electrotome use is not suitable under this scenario ; if it must be used , the power should be minimized . smoke should be quickly suctioned to avoid aerosol generation . \n\n postoperative management \n\n postoperative management of patients \n\n after the operation , the patient should be transferred to an isolation ward in the icu . the endotracheal tubes should be removed under analgesia to avoid violent coughing while the patient is stable . sputum aspiration should be performed by a closed suction system . trauma and surgery can impair the patient 's immune function . clinically , some asymptomatic covid-19 patients suffered rapid deterioration after surgery . surgeons and anesthesiologists should be aware that acute lung injury caused by covid-19 may exist preoperatively or worsen postoperatively . therefore , special attention should be paid to the monitoring of body temperature , infection , and hemodynamic index . reexamination of chest ct and rrt-pcr tests is also important . for postoperative trauma patients with fever , traumatic , or operative complications should also be considered to differentiate them from covid-19 . attention should be paid to symptomatic and etiological treatment . postoperative dyspnea and hypoxia should also be differentiated from complications such as pulmonary embolism . nutritional support and prevention of other complications ( bacterial infection , stress ulcer , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , and deep venous thrombosis ) should also be strengthened . \n\n quarantine \n\n based on current experience , if the medical personnel complete the operation successfully and comply with all the regulations without any accidental exposure , the patient does not need to be quarantined . otherwise , a 14-day medical observation is obligatory , and timely treatment is needed when any abnormalities occur . notably , some literature recommends a routine 14-day quarantine for relevant personnel involved in the operation for sars-cov-2 confirmed patients . however , extreme safety often results in severe incapacity to help patients , so a balance between safety and efficiency must be maintained . \n\n discussion \n\n the national health commission of china initially decided to temporarily call the disease novel coronavirus pneumonia or ncp . it was not until february 12 , 2020 , that the official name covid-19 was announced by the who . shortly after the who announced the disease 's official name , the virus causing it was named sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , highlighting the new virus 's similarity to the sars virus identified in 2003 . based on epidemiological data up to jan. 4 , 2020 , the estimated r0 was 2.2 ( 95 % ci , 1.4 to 3.9 ) , while the latest study surveying cases up to feb. 14 , 2020 , further calculated that the r0 of covid-19 was 3.77 . therefore , researchers estimated that in terms of infection ability , sars-cov-2 was slightly higher than the sars virus and significantly higher than the mers-cov . according to clinical characteristic analysis of sars-cov-2 infection in china , the mortality was 2.01 % out of 28,018 cases as of feb. 6 , 2020 . by human-to-human transmission , sars-cov-2 had spread rapidly from wuhan , china , to 24 other countries as of feb. 12 , 2020 . the number of cases within china and other countries is rapidly increasing , and it is estimated that for every additional 10 % decrease in transmission rate , the peak population will be reduced by 20-47 % . the cumulative number of infected cases and deaths will be reduced by 23-49 % due to comprehensive interventions . if current interventions continue , it is expected that the number of people infected will peak in early march 2020 . based on the epidemiological analysis , only 1.18 % of the patients had direct contact with wild animals , 31.30 % of the patients had been in wuhan , and 71.80 % of the patients had contact with people from wuhan . common symptoms included fever , cough , and diarrhea . a total of 76.4 % of patients had radiologic findings manifested as pneumonia , with the remaining patients exhibiting normal radiologic findings . poor clinical outcomes can be predicted by disease severity , including oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count , and chest ct manifestations . \n\n the transmission by aerosols is still under investigation . aerosols are solid , liquid , solid , and liquid granular substances suspended in the air , such as dust , smoke , fog , and microorganisms . these may be the `` flying vehicles '' for covid-19 . covid-19 aerosols are related to the increased risk of covid-19 transmission . tracheal intubation , noninvasive ventilation , tracheotomy , manual ventilation before intubation , bronchoscopy , cardiopulmonary resuscitation , sputum suction , and other airway operations , as well as the use of electrotome , suction , and drainage , all inevitably produce a large number of aerosols . when carrying out these operations , the protection and training of medical personnel should be strengthened , and preventive measures to protect against aerosols are recommended , including n95 respirators , papr , goggles or face shields , disposable fluid-resistant gowns , and limiting the number of people in the room . \n\n based on experience from the hospital in wuhan , patients with covid-19 have high mortality after surgery . as of february 14 , 2020 , 6 gastrointestinal operations were performed in the general surgery department of the authors ' hospital ; one 60-year-old male died of respiratory failure 14 days after surgery , and one died of septic shock , for a mortality rate of 33.33 % . another group of eight covid-19 confirmed patients in zhongnan hospital of wuhan university underwent gastrointestinal surgeries ( seven gastrointestinal tumors and one benign case ) ; one patient died of covid-19 after left hemicolectomy with the diagnosis of postoperative recurrence of renal cancer involving the descending colon with intestinal obstruction , and one tumor patient died from postoperative complications of abdominal infection , for a mortality rate of 25 % . trauma patients usually have massive hemorrhage , shock , and contamination . damage control strategies should be complied with to correct fatal triads caused by hypothermia , acidosis , and coagulopathy . meanwhile , effective oxygen therapy and organ function support are also indispensable . \n\n moreover , additional attention should be paid to patients in critical condition and to those who develop severe pneumonia after trauma . among covid-19 patients , critical patients , including patients with respiratory failure , septic shock , and other organ failures , have accounted for 29 % ~32 % . identifying high-risk groups with severe illness can also help reduce the occurrence of poor prognosis . the possible high-risk groups include patients over 65 years old , patients with obesity , and patients with other diseases ( such as chronic pulmonary disease , hypertension , heart disease , kidney disease , diabetes , tumor , and immune deficiency ) . \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe doffing \n\n the covid-19 outbreak poses significant challenges to hospital staff and specifically trauma surgeons , which must offer optimal and timely care despite the circumstances . strict safety protocols must be adhered to when carrying out emergency care for patients with severe trauma and other surgical diseases , which means that all the measures shall be carried out to preserve the ability of the medical staff to achieve the purpose of effective care without sacrificing the safety of all involved . the perspectives in this paper can not be a substitute for clinical judgment and expert consultation but can help provide up-to-date guidance on the clinical management of emergency surgery for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 ( fig . 4 ) . \n\n conclusion \n\n in conclusion , the covid-19 outbreak raises several issues concerning the safety of medical personnel and patients . areas with high incidence rates of covid-19 should conduct operations with caution and protection should be strengthened while ensuring suitable facilities to carry out optimal care with maximal safety . with the accumulation of clinical experience and in-depth research , some of the practices may require modification when additional high-quality evidence emerges . the above is china 's experience in treating trauma patients during the covid-19 outbreak . we hope that this report will help hospitals worldwide prepare for future covid-19 outbreaks and infection control in unexpected conditions . \n\n abbreviations \n\n covid-19 \n\n corona virus disease \n\n sars-cov-2 \n\n severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \n\n

00001000	applications of 3d printing technology to address covid-19 related supply shortages \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) was first identified in an outbreak in wuhan , china on december 8 , 2019 . globally , the number of affected covid-19 patients is growing exponentially , with the death toll exceeding 27,300 as of march 27 , 2020 . worldwide , there is a limited supply of n95 respirator masks , face shields , ventilator valves , testing kits and other personal protective equipment . thus , adequate production and distribution of personal protective equipment is critical during this pandemic . to address these shortages , three-dimensional ( 3d ) printing , a novel and innovative technology used to fabricate complex architectures , is well suited . 3d printing is an adjustable , robotic platform allowing for tailored deposition of biomaterials using computer-aided design systems to formulate layer-by-layer custom designs with controlled architecture and composition . \n\n masks \n\n n95 respirators masks have two advantages over surgical , paper or cloth masks : 1 ) they are > 95 % efficient at filtering 0.3-microm airborne particles and 2 ) they are fit tested to each user to ensure an adequate seal , such that air and small droplets do not enter around the edges of the mask and into the health care worker 's breathing zone . the centers for disease control and prevention recommends n95 masks for health care workers taking care of patients with covid-19 . \n\n 3d printing can be used to produce tailored seal designs for improving mask comfort and fit . to customize face mask seals , 3d laser scanning can be implemented to scan exact facial parameters , with a tailored and customized face seal n95 template . anthropometric data of the chin arc , jawline , face and nose lengths , and nose protrusion measurements can be taken into account with this customized seal . in a study using face seal prototypes with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic using a fused deposition modeling 3d printer , three subjects showed improved contact pressure compared with use of 3m 8210 n95 ffr respirator masks . moreover , a personalized mask may account for facial hair length and density for a more precise fit . \n\n displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . the biomaterials displayed in this image have been fully characterized in the medical literature , with the same material composition of n95 masks . the mask includes several layers thereby ensure effective filtration of viral particles . \n\n figure 1 \n\n standard n95 masks consist of filtration material composed of electrostatic non-woven polypropylene ( pp ) fibers which are semi-rigid , lightweight and fatigue resistant . the semi-crystalline structure may cause significant distortion of the 3d printed parts upon cooling thereby making 3d printing difficult . material extrusion 3d printing was used to design a 3d printable thermoplastic elastomeric material from a blend of polypropylene ( pp ) and styrene- ( ethylene-butylene ) -styrene ( sebs ) . this blend provides better printability and flexibility for n95 mask design . pp is commonly used for various industrial applications due to its low cost , processability , printability , recyclability and mechanical integrity . sebs is a polymeric elastomer with low processing temperature and low distortion during extrusion . thus , the pp/sebs combination would improve the processability of 3d printed n95 masks . moreover , controlling the thermoplastic elastomer ratio allows for tailoring the flexibility and elasticity of the 3d model material for better fitted masks . 3d melt electrospinning printing can also be used to create pp microfibers with sequential layering to accurately obtain a 3d form . thus , 3d printing procedures may allow for the creation of stable and biocompatible n95 masks that are comparable to industrial manufacturing brands . figure 1 displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . \n\n face shields \n\n polycarbonate and polyester , polyvinyl chloride and other synthetic polymers are commonly used to make surgical face shields . these biomaterials are transparent , lightweight and provide high optical clarity . the polymers can easily be printed using 3d technology to meet the needs of healthcare workers treating covid-19 . \n\n covid-19 specimen collection kit \n\n creating 3d printed test swabs would help increase covid-19 testing capacity . nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs can be made from a flexible polymer , using polystyrene for the shaft . the tip can be tailored to be micro fine using computer-aided design software . thereafter , swab bud lattice fibers can be made from calcium alginate using hydrogels using 3d tissue engineering . \n\n ventilator valves \n\n ventilator valves are attachments used to deliver oxygen at fixed concentrations for patients with acute respiratory distress , including covid-19 patients . 3d printing technology can be used via a filament extrusion system or a polymer-laser powder bed fusion process to print single-use valve sets . 3d printers can design the different elements of the valve using biomaterials such as polyamide and polysulfone , polycarbonate , silicone rubber and stainless steel . furthermore , these disposable valves eliminate time-consuming sterilization . \n\n medications \n\n 3d printing techniques , such as fused filament , inkjet , extrusion and powder extrusion , allow for fabrication of 3d printed pills . medication-printing technologies typically utilize a small nozzle to lay thin disc-shaped layers of powders and deposit microscopic droplets of liquid to bind the materials . a coaxial needle extrusion 3d technology was used to print active pharmaceutical ingredients and create combinations of controlled dosing of drugs . while there are no specific antivirals or vaccines for treatment of covid-19 , several well-characterized anti-viral drugs are being considered as therapies . it may be possible to use 3d medication-printing technology to effectively and rapidly print lopinavir/ritonavir , chloroquine , and hydroxychloroquine pills . thus , 3d technology has the potential to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry , making drug research , development and production applicable to covid-19 patients . \n\n as the covid-19 outbreak rapidly evolves , there has been a personal protective equipment shortage globally . 3d printing inventions can be rapidly applied to address these deficiencies . cost , processing time , testing , and manpower are potential barriers to creating 3d-printed personal protective equipment . however , the synthetic polymer biomaterials needed for 3d-printed personal protective equipment are exact or very similar in composition to the standard manufacturing grade products ( i.e . n95 masks provides the same fluid barrier and air filtration protection ) . moreover , these synthetic polymer materials are readily available and cost effective ( i.e . polypropylene is 12.47 cents per pound ) . 3d printer costs vary but are an excellent investment with labor performed via robotics . in conjunction with flattening the curve via social distancing , this pioneering technology can provide adequate personal protective equipment for health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic . \n\n abbreviations : \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) \n\n three-dimensional ( 3d ) \n\n polypropylene ( pp ) \n\n

00010010	transmission potential of the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) onboard the diamond princess cruises ship , 2020 \n\n an outbreak of covid-19 developed aboard the princess cruises ship during january-february 2020 . using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members , we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak . our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore ( approximate range : 1.1-7 ) . our findings suggest that rt decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control . most recent estimates of rt reached values largely below the epidemic threshold , indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n introduction \n\n while the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) spread rapidly throughout china for several weeks since december 2019 , the virus had not taken off outside china in part due to the unprecedented social distancing measures that the chinese government put in place . one exception is the outbreak of covid-19 that developed aboard the diamond princess ship which was detected in early february when one of its passengers , a traveler from hong kong , tested positive for the novel coronavirus . the number of cases in the diamond princess ship quickly jumped to 454 confirmed cases by february 18 , 2020 . in contrast , the total number of cases in singapore , one of the countries with the highest number of covid-19 cases after china , was only 77 at the time . \n\n accumulating evidence indicates that the novel coronavirus can spread widely in confined settings including hospitals , cruise ships , prisons , and churches . in wuhan city , china , outbreaks inside health care settings led to the infection of hundreds of health professionals . in tokyo , japan , most of the reported infections have been linked to a party inside a traditional wooden ship , called yakatabune while most of the infections in korea have affected members of one church and one hospital . \n\n tracking the evolution of the transmission potential of covid-19 in different confined settings and how it compares with that of other respiratory diseases such influenza has public health implications . when outbreaks occur in confined settings , it is useful to investigate how the effective reproduction number changes as a result of interventions strategies such as the quarantine that the japanese government imposed on travelers and crew members aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n in this study we sought to characterize the temporal variation in the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak aboard the princess cruises ship using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data by dates of symptoms onset describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members . \n\n epidemiological incidence cases \n\n in yokohama , japan , an outbreak of covid-19 has been unfolding on board the princess cruise ship , which has been under quarantine orders since february 5 , 2020 , after a former passenger of the diamond princess ship tested positive for the virus after disembarking in hong kong . as of february 22 , 2020 , two days after the scheduled two-week quarantine came to an end , a total of 621 symptomatic and asymptomatic people including one quarantine officer , one nurse and one administrative officer tested positive for covid-19 out of the 3711 passengers and crew members on board . laboratory tests by pcr that prioritize symptomatic or high-risk groups have been conducted . \n\n incidence curves of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases of covid-19 among passengers and crew members of the outbreak unfolding aboard the princess cruises ship are publicly available from the national institute of infectious diseases , japan ( niid ) website . daily time series of symptomatic patients , from january 20 , 2020 to february 18 , 2020 were extracted . however , to reconstruct the trajectory of the epidemic , only 197 cases have dates of symptoms onset are available out of a total of 300 confirmed symptomatic cases . \n\n of the 103 symptomatic cases with missing onset dates , a total of the 79 cases are passengers while 24 cases are crew members . moreover , out of the 79 passenger cases , 30 cases were reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 21 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 28 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . of 24 crew member cases , 1 case was reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 15 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 8 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . \n\n epidemiological modeling \n\n we connected the daily incidence series with a discrete-time integral equation to describe the epidemic dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . specifically , let fs denote the probability mass function of the serial interval of covid-19 , where the serial interval is defined as the time from illness onset in the primary case to time of illness onset in the secondary case . then fs , of length s days , is given by \n\n for s > 0 , f ( s ) represents the cumulative distribution function of the gamma distribution . we characterized the expected number of new incident cases e [ ci , t ] in type i at symptom onset week t as follows , where rij denotes the average number of cases of type i infected by a single individual of type j . here we assume that the incidence , ci , t , follows a poisson sampling process with expected value e [ ci , t ] . \n\n the reproduction matrix for each type is given by \n\n this matrix is referred to as a next-generation matrix ( ngm ) in a fully susceptible population ( , pp . 873-885 ) . using this matrix , we derive the instantaneous time-dependent effective reproduction number , rt , for the entire transmission dynamics from the largest eigenvalue of the ngm . under the assumption that the per-contact infection probability and the generation interval are consistent over time regardless of the type of infection , the ngm quantifies the within type and inter-type patterns of transmission . the sum of the value in column j is the reproduction number for a specific type j . \n\n serial interval estimates of covid-19 were derived from previous studies of covid-19 , indicating that it follows a gamma distribution with the mean and sd at 7.5 and 3.4 days , respectively , based on ref .. the maximum value of the serial interval was fixed at 20 days as the cumulative probability distribution of the gamma distribution up to 20 days reaches 0.991 . \n\n we estimated model parameters and made projections using a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) method in a bayesian framework . point estimates and corresponding 95 % credibility intervals were drawn from the posterior probability distribution . all statistical analyses were conducted in r version 3.5.2 ( r foundation for statistical computing , vienna , austria ) and the 'rstan ' package ( no-u-turn-sampler ( nuts ) ) ( see table 1 ) . \n\n result \n\n day date event 1 jan/20/2020 departed from the

95 % cri : 0.3 , 0.8 ) for crew to crew . although vaccines are still in early development stages as of february 2020 , based on our findings , the corresponding target vaccination coverage to contain

of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 . passenger and crew also have total ( within-type and inter-type ) rt values largely below the epidemic threshold , with only small percentages at 0 % and 9 % above the epidemic threshold , respectively ( table 3 ) . \n\n discussion \n\n this is the first study to assess the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak that unfolded aboard the diamond princess ship , january-february 2020 . the overall mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore in the range 1.1-7 . however , following the implementation of the quarantine period , the overall rt decreased substantially compared to values estimated during the early stage , but it exhibited fluctuations around the epidemic threshold , which likely prolonged the outbreak . \n\n our results indicate that rt declined following the quarantine measures implemented by the japanese government on february 5 relative to values during the early phase of the outbreak . importantly , only those passengers and crew who tested positive for the novel coronavirus were permitted to disembark the diamond princess ship , with more than 80 percentage of the passengers and crews still on board as of february 18 , 2020 . our latest overall estimate of rt at 0.35 ( 95 % cri : 0.02 , 2.19 ) with only 2 % of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 suggested a low probability of observing a subsequent outbreak aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n our findings indicate that the passenger-to-passenger transmission type dominated the transmission dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . the rapid increase in the overall rt from day 12 ( january 31 , 2020 ) to day 19 ( february 7 , 2020 ) is greatly influenced by the increase in passenger-to-passenger transmission , and this time period covers the time lag between february 1 , 2020 when the index covid-19 case was reported and february 5 , 2020 when the japanese government requested the passengers to stay inside their cabin after the detection of a cluster of covid-19 positive cases . upon the implementation of the quarantine orders , the overall rt and rt for passengers aboard the diamond princess ship declined thereafter , while rt among crew maintained a steady level and only started to decline on day 25 of the outbreak ( february 13 , 2020 ) . this is consistent with the fact that passengers staying inside their cabins led to a substantial decline in passenger-to-passenger transmission type except for their interaction with cabin mates . indeed , the proportion of secondary infections inside the cabins increased from 7 % ( 1/15 ) on february 6 , 43 % ( 3/7 ) on february 10 , 2020 to 100 % ( 1/1 ) on february 14 , 2020 . thus , a high proportion of the symptomatic cases after the quarantine gradually shifted from largely passenger cases to crew cases . indeed , despite their potential risk of acquiring the infection , crews had to continue to work to deliver services to isolated passengers . the distribution of the median re by transmission type suggests that other transmission types likely contributed to this outbreak to some extent ( fig . 3 ) . because one quarantine officer , one nurse , and one administrative officer contracted covid-19 aboard the diamond princess ship , the infection risk continued to be significant inside the diamond princess ship . \n\n as for the crude asymptomatic ratios by age groups , they show significant differences across age groups . however , these crude ratios are severely influenced by the timing of specimen collection relative to the infection time . hence , these ratios could be better ascertained if additional data with the timing of specimen collection becomes available . \n\n several limitations should be listed . first , a total of 103 laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases with unknown onset dates were not incorporated in our analysis . although the high proportion of unavailable data ( 34 % ( 103/300 ) ) likely influenced a downward bias in estimates of transmission potential , our estimates still point to the high transmission potential of covid-19 inside confined settings . second , it is possible that reporting delays could have influenced our latest estimates of the effective reproduction number . in fact , the us government recently sent a chartered flight to transport the american passengers on board the diamond princess ship , and after the disembarkation process , a total of 14 american passengers tested positive for the disease on february 16 , 2020 . this event also contributes to a downward bias in r although the number of cases does not exceed the peak of the outbreak , further supporting the potent transmissibility of covid-19 in confined settings . \n\n our most recent estimate of the effective reproduction number of the ongoing covid-19 epidemic on board the diamond princess ship was largely below the epidemic threshold of 1.0 , which suggested a very low probability of observing secondary outbreaks of the disease in the diamond princess ship . \n\n funding statement \n\n km acknowledges support from the japan society for the promotion of science kakenhi grant number 18k17368 and from

00001000	contact transmission of covid-19 in south korea : novel investigation techniques for tracing contacts \n\n in the epidemiological investigation of an infectious disease , investigating , classifying , tracking , and managing contacts by identifying the patient 's route are important for preventing further transmission of the disease . however , omissions and errors in previous activities can occur when the investigation is performed through only a proxy interview with the patient . to overcome these limitations , methods that can objectively verify the patient 's claims ( medical facility records , global positioning system , card transactions , and closed-circuit television ) were used for the recent ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 contact investigations in south korea . \n\n introduction \n\n an epidemiological investigation aims to quickly determine the prevalence of an infectious disease whilst simultaneously revealing the cause , and source of the disease , and explore the transmission process to ultimately prevent the spread of the infectious disease . as individuals become the source of the infectious disease , and if person-to-person transmission is suspected , it is important to immediately identify , and manage people that are in close contact with suspected patients . in particular , if there are several unknown epidemiological and clinical characteristics , and an effective medical intervention is lacking ( as in the case of new infectious diseases such as covid-19 ) , contact management becomes 1 of the core strategies to minimize additional transmission . for these strategies to be successful , it is necessary to evaluate between-person exposure risk in all locations where there have been confirmed cases ( after the onset of symptoms ) , and to classify contact persons based on this risk . furthermore , it is also important to eliminate the possibility of exposure to infection in the places visited by the confirmed patient , by performing the appropriate disinfection of areas that can harbor environmental contamination . however , traditional investigative methods , depending on the patient or proxy interview , has the limitation of omissions and errors of previous activities . \n\n the covid-19 outbreak in china occurred on december 8th , 2019 , and the first case in korea was reported on january 20th , 2020 . as of february 14th , the total number of confirmed cases of covid-19 in korea was 28 . in the current epidemiological investigation contact investigation techniques that were used on a limited basis for the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) outbreak in 2015 , are being used in all confirmed cases of covid-19 . \n\n this report will provide a general overview of the contact investigation from the covid-19 national emergency response center , epidemiology and case management team and describe the various methods used to evaluate exposure risk . \n\n results \n\n covid-19 contact investigation and management comprised of the following : 1 ) determination of the location of the contact ( patient route ) , 2 ) exposure risk evaluation , 3 ) contact classification , and 4 ) contact management . the location of the contact was determined through the process of preliminary identification , by interviewing patients , and their acquaintances , and by objective verification of the investigated information . exposure risk evaluation was performed depending on the route of disease transmission , patient characteristics , and environmental characteristics . based on the results of the evaluation , the contacts were classified into close and casual contacts depending on the exposure . the method of managing the classified contacts was largely distinguished between movement restriction and symptom monitoring . movement restriction is a legal public health order , and quarantine ( isolation ) , home isolation , or controlled travel is enacted . symptom monitoring was performed as either active or passive monitoring , depending on the exposure risk ( figure 1 ) . \n\n the methods used to overcome recall and confirmation biases that can occur while determining the location of the contact include checking medical facilities records , phone-based global positioning system ( gps ) , card transaction records , and closed-circuit television ( cctv ; table 1 ) . \n\n 1 . history of using medical facilities and visiting pharmacies \n\n history of using medical facilities , and visiting pharmacies was used to estimate the window of time of infection , through an accurate evaluation of the clinical symptoms of the infectious disease , and initial onset of the symptoms . if a medical facility was included in the patient 's route , quarantine of the medical facility was conducted . \n\n 2 . gps \n\n consistency in the recall of the route of the patients identified through interview was evaluated . additionally , identification of the routes that the patient could not remember was also possible . however , another person 's information can be misunderstood as the patient 's information if the phone is not owned by or carried by the patient . gps uses cellular phone networks , therefore there are limitations in identifying the exact locations of a patient 's route . \n\n 3. credit card transaction log \n\n credit card transaction logs were used to assess the consistency in the route of the patient identified through interview , and the scope of contacts was assessed by specifying the locations visited . however , if the patient did not use a credit card under their name or if another person used the patient 's card , the information may be misinterpreted . thus , rechecking the contents of the credit card log was necessary , and instances of not being able to use the information at the appropriate time may occur . \n\n 4 . cctv \n\n by checking the video footage of the location of a patient 's path , cctv provided help to identify the details of each situation . for example , cctv was used to evaluate the level of exposure risk by identifying whether the patient wore masks , or had respiratory symptoms such as a cough . the limitations of using cctv were the lengthy time required to check the cctv , and the accuracy of patient identification if the cctv was not inside the facility or the patient was in a blind spot of the camera . \n\n discussion \n\n based on the experience of the mers outbreak in 2015 , laws were revised to supplement the areas that were lacking at the time . korea centers for disease control and prevention were able to use relevant information in epidemiological investigations to contain and prevent infection , thus enabling the establishment of a more comprehensive management of infectious diseases . furthermore , making accurate information available to the general public helps to minimize fear and confusion with respect to the risk of transmissibility of the disease . the use of methods that have objectively verified the patient 's route claims ( medical facility records , gps , card transactions , and cctv ) for covid-19 contact investigations in south korea has provided accurate information on the location , and time of exposure , and details of the situation , thus reducing omissions in a patient 's route due to recall or confirmation bias that may have arisen from patient or proxy interviews . \n\n however , the publicization of a patient 's route for the public 's benefit infringes upon the privacy of the patient . thus , it is necessary to establish a protocol to protect privacy . equally , more effort should be taken to provide accurate information to the public . patient information that is unrelated to the communication of risk of infectious diseases must be protected by clearly defining the standards of publicization and reporting of patient information for the public 's benefit when an infectious disease is prevalent . \n\n with regards to responding to the recent prevalence of covid-19 , korea centers for disease control and prevention are performing defense activities to contain and prevent infection at the appropriate time , with more objective and accurate methods for monitoring patient contacts by using personal information . however , an evaluation of the effectiveness of these monitoring methods when multiple patients are involved , is necessary after the situation has been controlled . epidemiological investigations require the collaboration of various related persons and must be conducted through a strict verification process . furthermore , investigations must be performed using systematic processes with scientific methods and principles , and cycles of continuous evaluation and feedback to identify the etiology , extent , progression and therapy for the infectious disease and the development of public health policies . \n\n conflicts of interest \n\n the authors declare no competing

00001000	strategic planning to augment the testing capacity for covid-19 in india . \n\n background & objectives : nearly 5,500 tests for coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) had been conducted on march 31 , 2020 across the indian council of medical research ( icmr ) -approved public and private laboratories in india . given the need to rapidly increase testing coverage , we undertook an exercise to explore and quantify interventions to increase the daily real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qrt-pcr ) -based testing capacity over the next few months . the objective of this exercise was to prepare a potential plan to scale-up covid-19 testing in india in the public sector . methods : potential increase in daily testing capacity of the existing public laboratories was calculated across the three base scenarios of shifts ( 9 , 16 and 24 h ) . additional testing capacity was added for each shift scenario based on interventions ranging from procurement of additional qrt-pcr machines , leveraging spare capacity on available qrt-pcr machines not drafted into covid-19 testing , to in-laboratory process optimization efforts . results : moving to a 24 h working model in the existing approved laboratories can enhance the daily testing capacity to 40,464 tests/day . the capacity can be further bolstered by leveraging qrt-pcr and nucleic acid amplification test ( naat ) -based machines available with the multidisciplinary research units ( mrus ) , national aids control organisation ( naco ) and national tuberculosis elimination programme ( ntep ) . using combination/multiplex kits , and provision of automated rna extraction platforms at all laboratories could also optimize run time and contribute to capacity increase by 1.5-2 times . interpretation & conclusions : adopting these interventions could help increase public sector 's daily testing capacity to nearly 100,000-120,000 tests/day . it is important to note that utilization of the scaled-up testing capacity will require deployment of additional workforce , procurement of corresponding commodities for testing and scale-up of sample collection and transportation efforts . 
01100000	using integrated computational approaches to identify safe and rapid treatment for sars-cov-2 \n\n abstract \n\n sars-cov-2 is a new generation of coronavirus , which was first determined in wuhan , china , in december 2019 . so far , however , there no effective treatment has been found to stop this new generation of coronavirus but discovering of the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 main protease ( sars-cov-2 mpro ) may facilitate searching for new therapies for sars-cov-2 . the aim was to assess the effectiveness of available fda approved drugs which can construct a covalent bond with cys145 inside binding site sars-cov-2 main protease by using covalent docking screening . we conducted the covdock module mmgbsa module in the schrodinger suite 2020-1 , to examine the covalent bonding utilizing . besides , we submitted the top three drugs to molecular dynamics simulations via gromacs 2018.1 . the covalent docking showed that saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir and prevacid have the highest binding energies mmgbsa of -72.17 , -72.02 , -65.19 , -57.65 , -54.25 , -51.8 , and -51.14 kcal/mol , respectively . the 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation was conducted for saquinavir , ritonavir and remdesivir to evaluate the stability of these drugs inside the binding pocket of sars-cov-2 main protease . the current study provides a powerful in silico results , means for rapid screening of drugs as anti-protease medications and recommend that the above-mentioned drugs can be used in the treatment of sars-cov-2 in combined or sole therapy . \n\n communicated by ramaswamy h. sarma \n\n introduction \n\n sars-cov-2 also called 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ' abbreviated sars-cov-2 was recognized to be the causative of atypical pneumonia ( joshi , ; pant et al. , ) outbreak in wuhan , china ( hasan , ; s. a. khan et al. , 2020 ) . the virus belongs to the family known as 'coronaviruses ' because of the crown-like appearance of spikes glycoproteins on the envelope under an electron microscope ( y chen et al. , ) . world health organization ( who ) recently announced that the virus transforms from epidemic to pandemic , which requires urgent intervention to prevent the growing spread of the virus across the globe ( chan et al. , ) . the total confirmed cases 2,347,884 with 738,923 cases in the united state of america ( usa ) alone and the total death of 161,138 ( as of april 19 ) , with mortality estimated within 2 % and about 3.4 % , according to estimates of approved cases and death worldwide ( n. chen et al. , ) . the most familiar is a virus that arose from the rhinolophus bat which is > 96 % homologous with the modern sars-cov-2 virus and it is just 79 % homologous with the initial sars-cov ( fisher & heymann , ) . the fast-growing number of infected cases globally urged the world health organization to announce a state of global health emergency to correlate scientific and medical disciplines to develop rapidly an effective treatment for patients , ( morse et al. , ; sarma et al. , ) elderly patients and people with severe underlying health diseases like heart diseases , lung illness , and diabetic patients , for instance , appear to be at greater risk of revealing severe sars-cov-2 requires immediate intervention rather than waiting virus vaccine which may require 1 year to be available ( enayatkhani , ) . while drug repurposing could be a short-term and fast resolution to handle sars-cov-2 patients ( elfiky , ; r. j. khan et al. , 2020 ; kumar et al. , ) , repurposing existing drugs can offer a good choice to overcome the virus and offer better risk-versus trade-off as compared with discovering new drug and can help overcome time waiting for new therapy rather than use the available resources ( elmezayen , ; muralidharan , ) one successful repurposing drug story includes duloxetine which originally developed for depression and fda approved as the first-in-class choice for stress urinary incontinence ( sweeney & chancellor , ) , duloxetine initially created as antidepressant also is now passed to phase iii clinical trials as a first-in-class treatment for premature ejaculation ( mcmahon , ) and thalidomide , which had a tragic start as an over-the-counter sedative for morning sickness in pregnancy is now being applied to manage leprosy and multiple myeloma ( hideshima & anderson , ) . \n\n as a result of , a newly issued x-ray crystal of sars-cov-2 main protein ( mpro ) , we planning to use computational approaches ( cameron et al. , 2013 ) to contribute to find an effective treatment for sars-cov-2.thereby , computational analyses speed up these approaches since they allow to handle millions of data simultaneously ( gupta et al. , 2020 ) . molecular docking includes a set of computational methods and algorithms that aimed to identify novel relationships between chemical ligands and targets through using the modelling of their direct physical interaction ( aanouz , ; ekins et al. , ) . in present study , we attend to evaluate some of approved drugs to be as covalent binders , irreversible interactions , which can provide a powerful strategy to fight against epidemic viruses . and molecular dynamics simulations can give a more detail for the image which got from molecular covalent docking . \n\n materials and methods \n\n covalent virtual screening \n\n the crystal structure of fda-available covalent drugs which available in table 1 were selected based on the review of kumalo et al . and some of the antiviral drugs that can form a covalent bond to the target protein . and we aim also here to redirect them for other indications specially to see their possibility to fight against sars-cov-2 . thence , we searched about the chosen drugs in pubchem ( https : //pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) to identify the possibility of the selected drugs to be as covalent binders toward sars-cov-2 mpro . where , pubchem provides detailed information about the selected drugs rather than other repositories , especially , the property of drug to form covalent bond . before starting covalent docking , we downloaded the selected drugs one by one and optimize them by using the ligprep ( lim et al. , ) based on the opls_2005 force field and generated possible state employing epik in the schrodinger 2020 ( elfiky ; s. a. khan et al.,2020 ) . in the next step , the structure of sars-cov-2 mpro ( 6lu7 ) was downloaded from protein data bank ( http : //www.rcsb.org/pdb ) ( jin et al . , ) . the protease structure was optimized by adding hydrogens , removing water molecules and optimizing charge using the protein preparation wizard module ( kumalo et al. , ) in schrodinger suite 2020-1 . the covalent docking protocol was preferred since the cysteine 145 residue which is available in the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro considered as a vital residue that can form a covalent bond with the drug if it can interact covalently . the different mechanisms for the cys145-fda drug were mentioned in table 1 based on the nature of the drug so that the reactive functional group on the ligand and receptor residue are identified and the bond is formed between the correct atoms . these covalently docked complexes were created using covdock in schrodinger suite 2020-1 . finally , we selected the lowest the mmgbsa value for each drug as a propriate conformation of the drug inside the binding pocket . \n\n entry name pubchem id molecular

al. , ) . we used swiss param to produce the topologies of drugs ( zoete et al. , ) . all protein-drug systems were solvated with three-point transferable intermolecular potential ( tip3p ) and their charges were neutralized via adding na or cl ions . in the following step , the protein-drugs systems were energetically minimized through the steepest descent algorithm at a tolerance value of 1000 kj/mol.nm . then the equilibration with position restraint on the protein molecules for 0.1 ns using nvt and npt ensembles were done . electrostatic interactions were evaluated by particle mesh ewald summation ( darden et al. , ) . we performed the molecular dynamics simulation with no restraint on the protein molecules or ligand to determine the stability in the final step ( time step of 0.015 ns ) . rmsd , rmsf , rg , and number of hydrogen bonds were chosen to analyze md trajectories by using gromacs utilities . \n\n principal component analysis \n\n the principal component analysis ( pca ) approach was employed to calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues and their projection along with the first two principal components ( al-khafaji & taskin tok , ) . this approach is based on the protocol of gromacs 2018.1 ( abraham et al. , ) . it is used to simplify the effect of drugs on the dynamic motion of the targeted protein where it extracts the dynamic motions in simulations that are required for their biological function ( amadei et al. , ) . we got the principal component analysis from the md trajectories . a series of eigenvectors and eigenvalues were generated by diagonalizing the matrix . we chose trajectories of the protein backbone of the complexes to get 2 d-projection of motion of trajectory . \n\n results \n\n to assess the possibility of selected fda drugs to work as treatment of sars-cov-2 , the covalent docking was utilized to screen the selected library and rank them according to their binding affinities . the calculated binding free energies of some available drugs using docking score , glide gscore , and ensemble-average mm/gbsa are shown in table 1 . \n\n to validate our covalent docking results , the correlation between mmgbsa and docking score was constructed ( figure 1 ) . the binding energy mmgbsa-docking score correlation shows a good correlation ( r2 = 0.6299 ) . based on this correlation , we chose the top three ranked-mmgbsa and docking score values of fda drugs for dissection their binding modes inside the binding site . covalent docking showed that saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir , and prevacid have -72.17 , -72.02 , -65.19 , -57.65 , -54.25 , -51.8 , and -51.14 , respectively . where all the top-eight fda drugs show a higher affinity to form a covalent , irreversible bond with cys145 of sars-cov-2 mpro . here we investigated the role of molecular weight upon the affinity of selected drugs to bind covalently to cys145 , whereas 57 % of selected drugs which have molecular weight over than 600 g/mol ( figure 2 ) . and have higher free binding energy mmgbsa than -50 kcal/mol . while the ratio of selected drugs decreased to be 16 % of drugs which can form covalent bonding with over than -50 kcal/mol . surprisingly , none of the selected drugs which have a molecular weight below than 300 g/mol can form a good affinity of binding energy . this indicates that higher molecular weight covalent warheads can form stable and efficient binding energy . \n\n the correlation between mmgbsa binding energies and docking score . \n\n effect of molecular weight upon the mmgbsa binding energy . \n\n docked complex analyses \n\n what stands out in the table 1 is saquinavir has the highest binding affinity ( lowest binding energy mmgbsa of 72.17 kcal/mol ) . therefore , the deep examination of saquinavir is needed . figure 3 shows that saquinavir not only formed covalent bond of 1.81 a with cys145 but also formed five hydrogen bonds inside the pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro . in the second rank ritonavir as presented in table 1 has -72.02 kcal/mol . \n\n covalent docking analysis of saquinavir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n this high affinity resulted from covalent bond between ritonavir and cys145 of 1.82 a ( figure 4 ) through nucleophilic addition to double bond reaction besides it interacted within binding site by forming three hydrogen bonds . despite remdesivir formed covalent bond with cys145 of 1.82 a and three hydrogen bonds ( figure 5 ) and this is similar to ritonavir , but the mmgbsa value is lower than that of ritonavir this may due to nature of reaction which in remdesivir nucleophilic addition to triple bond . \n\n covalent docking analysis of ritonavir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n covalent docking analysis of remdesivir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n molecular dynamic simulation \n\n the effect of drug-protein interactions upon dynamics of biological system is a fundamental in drug discovery thereby we used rmsd to investigate the influence of saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir upon the stability of sars-cov-2 mpro . we utilized gromacs to execute the md simulations of 50 ns for three drug-protein systems besides of apo protein . rmsd fluctuations for both apo and hollo forms were measured and presented . the rmsd was calculated to assess the overall dynamics , stability , and convergence of the various systems and the results are presented in figure 6 ( a ) . \n\n analysis of rmsd , rmsf , rg and hydrogen bonding of saquinvir-sars-cov-2 mpro , ritonavir- sars-cov-2 mpro and remdesivir- sars-cov-2 mpro . ( a ) the protein 's backbone rmsd values with respect to time . ( b ) rmsf of the protein 's backbone with respect to position of residue in the protein . ( c ) rg of the protein backbone over the entire time of md simulation . ( d ) the number of hydrogen bonds through all the time of md simulation . \n\n figure 6 ( a ) shows there is a significant decrease in the rmsd value when sars-cov-2 main protease whether it bound to saquinavir , ritonavir , or remedisivir . further analysis revealed that the rmsd average of apo sars-cov-2 main protease was 0.294 nm but when it bound to saquinavir , ritonavir , and remedisivir the rmsd averages were.01865 , 0.2130 , and 0.2053 nm , respectively . another significant aspect of md simulation is the flexibility of protein 's backbone which can be assessed through measuring rmsf value . the results of the comparative analysis between these drugs and their effects upon sars-cov-2 main protease are illustrated in figure 6 ( b ) . closer scrutiny of figure 6 ( b ) exhibits the binding of saquinavir diminished the fluctuations of the protein 's backbone . and behavior is also can be seen from figure 6 ( b ) where the binding of both ritonavir and remedisivir led to reducing the flexibility of the protein . the radius of gyration ( rg ) is a definition of system 's density , and substantially influences the folding rate and stability of proteins . rg was employed to assess the compactness of all complexes . in this work , rg values are in agreement with rmsf values where there are no significant differences between apo form and hollo forms as presented in figure 6 ( c ) . this reveals that protein remained stable and compact all through the 50 ns time . the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds is a vital aspect to give an impression about the stability of drug and protein . also , the number of hydrogen bonds is relevant to the binding scores of molecular docking process . we calculated the hydrogen bonds over time to validate the stable interactions between top three drugs and their corresponding target . as seen in the figure 6 ( d ) the ritonavir has highest order of hydrogen bonding ( the average =3.35 ) , while saquinavir has an average of 1.68 . \n\n principle component analysis ( pca ) \n\n the essential dynamic method is a tool to explore the dynamical behavior in the space of sars-cov-2 main protease combined with saquinavir , ritonavir , and remedisivir . basically , the comparison of the drug-bound sars-cov-2 mpro and drug-unbound was made as reference . in order to further understand the configurational space , we selected the first two principal components ( pc1 , pc2 ) to analyze their projection of trajectories during the simulations of ligand free and ligand bound sars-cov-2 mpro of the phase space ( shown in figure 7 ) . during the four system simulations , the results clearly show that the unbound ligand protein covered a wider region of phase space , while all three drug-protein system occupied a smaller region of phase space . especially , saquinavir reduced the essential dynamics to lowest degree of functional motions as compared with another drugs . moreover , the pca results suggest that the drug-bound sars-cov-2 mpro is more stable than ligand-unbound sars-cov-2 mpro form of sars-cov-2 mpro . in short , the pca results are also in agreement with the rmsd and rmsf results , which enhance the validity of the performed analysis . \n\n two-dimensional projection of motion of trajectory of sars-cov-2 mpro bound with drugs over the pc1 and pc2 . \n\n discussion \n\n sars-cov-2 causes major pandemic health issue since its spread across the world and can infect humans mainly respiratory system causing severe pneumonia with no vaccine and drug treatment available . prior study that have referred to the significance of molecular docking to determine effective treatment in short time ( wu , et al. , ) . in reviewing the literature , we took the advantage of possibility of fda available drugs that can be as a covalent warhead to inhibit the sars-cov-2 mpro with cys145 . an initial objective of the project was to identify effective and applicable treatment . the present study focused on the main protease ( mpro ) , especially pdb id ( 6lu7 ) as a potential target for several marketed drugs as possible therapeutic option to combat the virus to see the capability of these drugs to bind with the cysteine 145 residue which is available in the binding site of sars-cov-2 main protease . the mpro in sars-cov-2 is necessary for the proteolytic maturation of the virus targeting this protein to limit the expansion of infection by hindering the cleavage of the viral polyprotein . the most interesting finding was that the both saquinavir and ritonavir have the same affinity ( binding energy mmgbsa -72 kcal/mol ) to block binding site of sars-cov-2 with irreversible interactions . this study supports evidence from previous observations that lopinavir/ritonavir can inhibit sars-cov-2 ( lim et al. , ) . another important outcome was that the remdesivir comes in second rank with binding affinity ( mmgbsa = -65 kcal/mol ) . whereas previous research has established that remdesivir can inhibit sars-cov-2 m proenzyme through docking results . another significant finding , delavirdine computationally showed the ability to form irreversible covalent bond of -57.65 kcal/mol mmgbsa binding energy . moreover , indinavir and cefuroxime axetil exhibited the possibility to halt the pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro by forming stable interaction through covalent bonding and hydrogen bonding ( mmgbsa binding energies -54 kcal/mol ) . furthermore , oseltamivir and prevacid exhibited same affinity to bind with sars-cov-2 protease through one covalent bond and one hydrogen bond ( -51 kcal/mol ) , which is a good explanation for the activity of oseltamivir ( peeri et al. , ) . in this study , results obtained show the binding affinity of drugs to an active site depends on several factors mainly the ability of a compound to form a covalent bond with amino acid residues of the mpro ( cys145 ) and length of a covalent bond , the number of h-bonds that can form with a pocket of the active site and type of nucleophilic addition of unsaturated bonds . in this concept , the structural features in saquinavir and ritonavir like free amine group ( -nh2 ) , hydroxyl groups ( -oh ) , carbonyl groups ( c=o ) in addition to ether group play key structural feature to form h-bond . results show the promising activities for antiretroviral drugs saquinavir that used for hiv/aids more than ritonavir and remdesivir followed by lopinavir as the best drugs to bind covalently toward sars-cov-2 mpro with lowest energy of binding . as discussed above , saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir , and prevacid showed the ability to block the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro by forming covalent bond and stabilized with hydrogen bonding . \n\n these outcomes are contrary to that of kandeel and al-nazawi ( 2020 ) , they found that ribavirin , telbivudine , vitamin b12 , and nicotinamide can be can form non-bonding interactions . whilst our results showed that , saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir can form irreversible interactions , which are considered an effective way for viral infections . \n\n in the present work , comparative molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir on the conformational and dynamical demeanor in either apo or hollo forms to understand the inhibitory possibility at atomic level . an initial mission of the project was to identify rapid , effective , safe , and available for large proportions of people , so we run covalent docking and mmgbsa to sift the possibility of these drug to form irreversible interactions . therefore , we had chosen these drugs because they carry covalent warheads that can bind covalently to the target . but the docking results are not adequate , so we run md simulations examine how much these drugs are able to form stable interactions with targeted protein . one interesting finding is the rmsd of protein backbone in apo status has higher average value , whereas the binding with top three drugs diminished these rmsd average . another important finding was that the rmsf of protein 's backbone be less flexible when it compared to apo form of sars-cov-2 main protease . it is somewhat surprising that the binding of three drugs have not noted in rg values . it is not yet clear whether the top three drugs can show an evidence to inhibit the targeted protein , thereby we lean on the principal component analysis to analyze the md trajectories to judge without dispute . the most obvious finding to emerge from 2d pca analysis is that the binding of under investigated drugs caused stately impact on essential dynamics of protein by reducing its essential dynamics to its least possible motions . these results seem to be consistent with rmsd results . a possible explanation for this might be that binding of the drugs make the binding site much narrower due to hydrogen bindings this makes the 3d structure of targeted protein more rigid so it will lose its biological functions . it is possible , therefore , that using these available drugs in two ways : either alone or in combined way . these findings suggest the possible use of nominated drugs against sars-cov-2 in short time as approved by covalent docking screening . also , the present results are significant in at least directing the clinicians to use these safe drugs to stop development of corona virus and second giving hope that available drugs that can be efficient treatment . \n\n conclusions \n\n coronavirus today emphasizes as a potential threat to all people worldwide . although extensive researches have been directed to stop sars-cov-2 , but till now there is no medication . meanwhile , the spreading with complicated crisis requires immediate therapy to overcome the spread and minimize mortality of sars-cov-2 . the aim of the present study was to discover effective treatment through repurposing some of available fda-approved drugs against sars-cov-2 mpro . where , they can provide covalent warheads in virtual screening . the most prominent finding to emerge from this study is that the affinity of covalent binder toward sars-cov-2 mpro is ranked : saquinavir > ritonavir > remdesivir > delavirdine > cefuroxime axetil > oseltamivir = prevacid . one of the more noteworthy findings in this study is that md simulation analysis that saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir can form stable interaction inside the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro . also , they restricted the essential motions of protein . overall , the results of screening toward mpret encourage for further clinical evaluations . they can be easy to reach and exploit as persuasive treatments for sars-cov-2 . \n\n acknowledgements \n\n authors thankful for staff membered of gaziantep university institute of health sciences , department of bioinformatics and computational biology . \n\n

00001000	strength , weakness , opportunity , threat ( swot ) analysis of the adaptations to anatomical education in the united kingdom and republic of ireland in response to the coivd-19 pandemic . \n\n the covid-19 pandemic has driven the fastest changes to higher education across the globe , necessitated by social distancing measures preventing any face to face teaching . this has led to an almost immediate switch to distance learning by higher education institutions . anatomy faces some unique challenges . intrinsically , anatomy is a three-dimensional subject that requires a sound understanding of the relationships between structures , often achieved by the study of human cadaveric material , models and virtual resources . this study sought to identify the approaches taken in the united kingdom and republic of ireland to deliver anatomical education through online means . data were collected from 14 different universities in the united kingdom and republic of ireland and compared adopting a thematic analysis approach . once themes were generated , they were collectively brought together using a strength , weakness , opportunity , threat ( swot ) analysis . key themes included the opportunity to develop new online resources and the chance to engage in new academic collaborations . academics frequently mentioned the challenge that time constrains could place on the quality and effectiveness of these resources ; especially as in many cases the aim of these resources is to compensate for a lack of exposure to cadaveric exposure . comparisons of the actions taken by multiple higher education institutions reveals the ways that academics have tried to balance this demand . discussions will facilitate decisions being made by higher education institutions regarding adapting the curriculum and assessment methods in anatomy . 
10001000	early trends for sars-cov-2 infection in central and north texas and impact on other circulating respiratory viruses . \n\n introduction : rapid diagnosis and isolation are key to containing the quick spread of a pandemic agent like sars-cov-2 , which has spread globally since its initial outbreak in wuhan province in china . sars-cov-2 is novel and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal viruses is just becoming apparent . we present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of march , 2020 . methods : this is a retrospective cohort study post launching of sars-cov-2 testing at baylor scott and white hospital ( bswh ) , temple , texas . testing for sars-cov-2 was performed by real-time rt-pcr assay and results were shared with state public health officials for immediate interventions . results : more than 3500 tests were performed during the first two weeks of testing for sars-cov-2 and identified 168 ( 4.7 % ) positive patients . sixty-two ( 3.2 % ) of the 1,912 ambulatory patients and 106 ( 6.3 % ) of the 1,659 ed/inpatients tested were positive . the highest rate of infection ( 6.9 % ) was seen in patients aged 25-34 years , while the lowest rate of infection was seen among patients aged < 25 years old ( 2 % ) . county-specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions . incidentally , this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of seasonal respiratory virus infections , perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness about sars-cov-2 among the general public , as well as the social distancing measures implemented in response to sars-cov-2 . data extracted for bswh from the cdc 's national respiratory and enteric virus surveillance system ( nrevss ) site revealed that influenza incidence was 8.7 % in march 2020 , compared to 25 % in march 2019 . conclusions : this study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management . this study provided sars-cov-2 testing data from ambulatory and inpatient population . epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like sars-cov-2 . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved . 
01000000	reverse vaccinology approach to design a novel multi-epitope vaccine candidate against covid-19 : an in silico study \n\n abstract \n\n at present , novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov , the causative agent of covid-19 ) has caused worldwide social and economic disruption . the disturbing statistics of this infection promoted us to develop an effective vaccine candidate against the covid-19 . in this study , bioinformatics approaches were employed to design and introduce a novel multi-epitope vaccine against 2019-ncov that can potentially trigger both cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell immune responses and investigated its biological activities by computational tools . three known antigenic proteins ( nucleocapsid , orf3a , and membrane protein , hereafter called nom ) from the virus were selected and analyzed for prediction of the potential immunogenic b and t-cell epitopes and then validated using bioinformatics tools . based on in silico analysis , we have constructed a multi-epitope vaccine candidate ( nom ) with five rich-epitopes domain including highly scored t and b-cell epitopes . after predicting and evaluating of the third structure of the protein candidate , the best 3 d predicted model was applied for docking studies with toll-like receptor 4 ( tlr4 ) and hla-a * 11:01 . in the next step , molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation was used to evaluate the stability of the designed fusion protein with tlr4 and hla-a * 11:01 receptors . md studies demonstrated that the nom-tlr4 and nom-hla-a * 11:01 docked models were stable during simulation time . in silico evaluation showed that the designed chimeric protein could simultaneously elicit humoral and cell-mediated immune responses . \n\n communicated by ramaswamy h. sarma \n\n introduction \n\n coronavirus disease covid-19 outbreak began in late december 2019 in wuhan , the capital of hubei province , china ( wang et al. , ) . scientists from all over the world are attempting to investigate this novel virus , known as 2019-ncov , which is highly contagious , and to discover effective interventions to control and prevent the disease ( heymann , ; huang et al. , ) . coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses ( ssrna+ ) belonging to the coronaviridae family . human coronaviruses hcov-229e , hcov-nl63 , hcov-oc43 , and hcov-hku1 are observed in almost one-third of the common cold ( lim et al. , ) . however , recently some cases of human coronavirus infections have led to fatal endemics , including sars ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) , mers ( middle east respiratory syndrome ) and covid-19 that are common diseases between humans and animals whose belong to the genus betacoronavirus of the coronaviridae family ( al-tawfiq et al. , ) . so far , the novel covid-19 has caused more than 700,000 illnesses and more than 33,000 deaths worldwide ( w.h.o. , 2020 ) . the genome size of this virus is about 30 kb and encodes structural and non-structural proteins like other coronaviruses . structural proteins include s protein ( spike ) , e protein ( envelope ) , m protein ( membrane ) , and n protein ( nucleocapsid ) ( ahmed et al. , ) . the increasing rate of covid-19 disease and the high morbidity necessitate the development of a specific and safe vaccine candidate as soon as possible . there is very little known actually about the pathogenesis of the virus ; therefore , an immunoinformatics-based approach to investigate the immunogenic epitopes and vaccine design using data from proteins sequencing of the covid-19 is required . \n\n n protein is the only structural protein that associates with replicase-transcriptase complexes and binds with genomic rna in coronaviruses ( cong et al. , ) . this protein is multifunctional and one of the most crucial structural components of coronaviruses . n protein is a structural and antigenic protein that is involved in packaging , transcription , and replication coronaviruses ( 4 ) . this data showed that n protein is a suitable candidate for targeting drug and vaccine design because this protein is conserved , antigenic and multifunctional ( 6 ) . leung and et al . concluded that n protein can be a suitable vaccine candidate against sars-cov because induce strong antibody and this process may trigger cytokine production ( leung et al. , ) . coronaviruses m protein also has a key role in the assembly of virions . the sars-cov m protein can interact with n protein and make a network of interactions with the genomic rna ( he et al. , ) . ong and et al . the covid-19 antigens such as s , n and m proteins introduced as a vaccine candidate ( 6 ) . this protein has also been studied as an epitope vaccine candidate against sars-cov ( 7 ) . \n\n open reading frame 3a ( orf3a ) is required for viral replication and virulence of sars cov . severe induction of proinflammatory cytokine is a sign of sars-cov and mers-cov infections . orf3a activates both pro-il-1beta gene expression and il-1beta secretion and leads to severe lung injury . ( siu et al. , ) . also , orf3a has an important role in sars-cov assembly or budding with the participation of m and e proteins ( mcbride & fielding , ) . these proteins are not only involved in the pathogenesis of the covid-19 virus but also have high antigenicity ( chan et al. , ; siu et al. , ; xu et al. , ) . in this study e , m , n , orf10 , orf8 , orf3a and m proteins were evaluated by available bioinformatics tools for designing an efficient multi-epitope vaccine for the stimulation of immune responses against covid-19 infection . \n\n since the covid-19 has been recently discovered , little immunological information is available . preliminary studies based on phylogenetic analyses of the covid-19 whole genome have suggested that this virus is very similar to the sars-cov ( 79.7 % identify ) ( 9 , 14 ) . given the apparent similarity between the two viruses , it could be concluded that previous studies on the protective immune responses against sars-cov may be useful for developing a vaccine for covid-19 . previous studies have suggested that both humoral and cellular immunity play important roles in protective responses against this virus ( deming et al. , ; yang et al. , ) . studies revealed that the formation of antibodies against the n protein of sars-cov , an immunogenic protein that is highly expressed during infection , is relatively common in patients infected with this virus ( liu et al. , ; lin et al. , ) . although these antibodies are effective , they have a shorter lifespan in recovering the patients . in addition to the specific humoral immunity , it has been shown that the cd4+ and cd8+ responses provide long-lasting protection against covid-19 . these studies showed that besides antibody-mediated immune response , cellular immunity is critical to induce protectivity in these infections ( liu et al. , ) . the concept of a multi-epitope vaccine is to efficiently identify and assemble b and t-cell epitopes that are more capable of stimulating the immune system and therefore can induce more potent and effective both arms of immune responses . peptides and epitopes have shown to be desirable candidates for vaccine development due to their relatively easy production , chemical stability , and lack of infectious potential ( patronov & doytchinova , ) . the experimental design and production of multi-epitope vaccines have improved dramatically in recent years . these vaccines are mainly made up of b-cell , cd8+ cytolytic t-cell ( ctls ) and cd4+ helper t-cells ( htls ) epitopes ( chiarella et al. , ) . since the antigenic epitopes of a protein could be predicted and detected , therefore the whole protein is not suitable to stimulate an immune response ( testa & philip , ; zheng et al. , ) . during the development of a vaccine candidate against covid-19 , complex pathogenic mechanisms and numerous pathogenic factors should be considered in vaccine formulation . \n\n in the present study , we aimed to design a novel multi-epitope fusion protein ( nucleocapsid , orf3a , and membrane protein or nom ) containing more efficient antigenic epitopes-rich domains . the biological activity of the engineered fusion protein was assessed by bioinformatics tools using the interaction between the vaccine candidate and the innate immune system receptor ( tlr4 ) and cellular immune system receptor ( hla-a * 11:01 ) . we strongly believe that the outcome of the present report will provide a potential vaccine candidate against 2019-ncov . \n\n materials and methods \n\n in this study , we designed a suitable vaccine candidate against covid-19 , by exploiting the programs of reverse vaccinology ( figure 1 ) \n\n strategies employed in the overall study . \n\n retrieval of protein sequences \n\n at first , the amino acid sequences of proteins were retrieved from the national centre for biotechnology information ( ncbi ) at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov in fasta format and performed for subsequent

selected six proteins of covid-19 virus ( table 1 ) that have an essential role in virulence and replication of the virus , and previous studies have highlighted the necessity of these proteins in coronaviruses function . after the antigenic analysis of these proteins , three proteins of n , orf3a , and m were selected for final analysis . \n\n prediction of t-cell ( hla class i and ii ) epitopes \n\n 1d sequence-based screening server rankpep was used to identify t-cell epitopes ( reche & reinherz , ) . this server predicts peptide binders to mhc molecules from protein sequences using the position-specific scoring matrix ( pssm ) . we have selected all hla class i alleles from the selection panel of rankpep server for prediction of epitopes of hla class i . to prediction of epitopes of hla class ii , we considered drb1 * 0101 , drb1 * 0301 , drb1 * 0401 , drb1 * 0701 , drb1 * 0801 , drb1 * 1101 , drb1 * 1301 , and drb1 * 1501 that cover hla variability of over 95 % of the human population worldwide ( kruiswijk et al. , ) . \n\n b-cell epitopes ( linear ) identification \n\n for the prediction of b-cell epitopes , the amino acid sequence was analyzed using bepipred and kolaskar & tongaonkar antigenicity ( http : //www.iedb.org/ ) servers ( vita et al. , ) . bepipred for linear epitope prediction uses both hidden markov model and amino acid propensity scales methods . kolaskar and tongaonkar evaluate the protein for b cell epitopes using the physicochemical properties of the amino acids and their frequencies of occurrence in recognized b cell epitopes ( kolaskar & tongaonkar , ; mirza et al. , ) . \n\n selection of epitope-rich domains and the final sequence \n\n according to the prediction results of the servers used , b cell epitopes and hla class i and ii epitopes that have had high scores were extracted and combined to generate multi-epitope protein . b cell and t cell epitope-rich domains of n , orf3a and m proteins were selected and joined to each other with an aaa linker . \n\n antigenicity and allergenicity evaluation \n\n antigenicity of designed recombinant protein predicted using the vaxijen v2.0 server . the vaxijen classified antigens based on auto cross-covariance ( acc ) transformation of protein sequences into uniform vectors of principal amino acid properties which is a novel alignment-independent method and overcome the limitations of alignment-dependent sequence methods ( doytchinova & flower , ) . the prediction of vaccine candidate allergenicity is essential . the allergenicity of the designed protein was computed by allertop ( http : //www.ddg-pharmfac.net/allertop/ ) . allertop method predicts recombinant protein allergenicity on auto cross-covariance acc that describe residue hydrophobicity , size , abundance , helix- and beta-strand forming propensities ( dimitrov et al. , ) . allertop v.2 has the highest accuracy ( 88.7 % ) compared to several servers for allergen prediction ( dimitrov et al. , ) . \n\n the physicochemical parameters \n\n the analyzed parameters consisted of the molecular weight , theoretical pi , amino acid composition , atomic composition , extinction coefficient , estimated half-life , instability index , aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathicity that were evaluated by protparam online server ( http : //us.expasy.org/tools/ protparam.html ) ( gasteiger et al. , ) . \n\n secondary and tertiary structure prediction \n\n gor was used for the designed protein secondary structure prediction ( https : //npsa-prabi.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat.pl ? page=/npsa/npsa_gor4.html ) ( kloczkowski et al. , ) . gor4 predict protein secondary structure using information theory . \n\n the tertiary structure was built using the galaxy web . galaxyweb server ( http : //galaxy.seoklab.org/ tbm ) is based on the tbm method . this server detects similar proteins and alignment with the target sequence , then make the model and finally perform model refinement ( shin et al. , ) . \n\n tertiary structure refinement and validation \n\n the best-modeled structure was refined using the galaxy refine server at ( http : //galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi ? type=refine ) . galaxy refined the model by molecular dynamics simulation . this method showed one of the best performances in improving protein structure quality . \n\n analysis of the final 3 d model was made using molprobity , prosa and ramachandran plot . ramachandran plot obtained from rampage calculates torsional angles residue-by-residue in protein and indicates that residues are in allowed , favored or outlier regions ( oberholser , ) . prosa web used to recognize the errors in the generated 3 d models using atomic coordinates of the model . prosa web was created z-score ( overall model quality ) and a plot of residue energies of proteins ( wiederstein & sippl , ) . clash analysis is very important for the validation of proteins . molprobity is a structure-validation web service that calculates the clash score , protein-geometry score , poor rotamers , ramachandran plot , and molprobity score . \n\n defining discontinuous b-cell epitopes of designed protein \n\n the interaction between antigen epitopes and antibodies is very essential to eliminate the infection . conformational epitopes are the most important and the most prevalent epitopes that are recognized by antibodies . all conformational epitope prediction methods require the 3 d structures of proteins . discontinuous epitopes of recombinant protein predicted using the ellipro server . this web-based predicts discontinuous epitopes based on protein-antibody interactions . ellipro server predicts conformational and linear b cell epitopes using thornton 's method and by modeller program or blast search of pdb predict and visualize of antibody epitopes ( ponomarenko et al. , ) . \n\n obtaining and preparing the structures of immune receptors and nom recombinant protein \n\n the crystallographic structures of tlr4 ( pdb id : 2z62 ( kim et al. , ) ) and hla-a * 11:01 ( pdb id : 5wjl ( culshaw et al. , 2017 ) ) were obtained from the pdb database ( berman et al. , ) . the structures were cleaned and crystallographic waters and co-crystallized molecules were deleted and only the monomer forms of each receptor were kept . then , the structures of the two receptors and the nom protein were prepared by the dock prep tool in ucsf chimera software ( pettersen et al. , ) where hydrogen atoms and charge were added to the structures to make them ready for the next step . in the next step , to stabilize and relax the structures in an aqueous physiological environment , each of the monomer form of the receptors and the nom protein were simulated for 100 ns . the details of the md simulation will be explained later . \n\n protein-protein molecular docking and refinement \n\n after the md simulation of each receptor and the nom recombinant protein , the last frame of the trajectory of each simulation was extracted and used as the input structures for protein-protein molecular docking . the patchdock webserver ( schneidman-duhovny et al. , ) with default parameters was used to predict the best positions and orientations where the two proteins can have the highest number of favorable interactions . afterward , the top 10 solutions were subjected to firedock webserver ( andrusier et al. , ; mashiach et al. , ) to refine the interaction of protein-protein complexes resulted from molecular docking . the top two complexes from coronavirus nom protein-tlr4 and nom recombinant protein-hla-a * 11:01 complexes were chosen based on global energies . these four complexes were then taken to the next step , md simulation . \n\n molecular dynamics simulation \n\n after performing the protein-protein molecular docking and finding the best orientations of the vaccine candidate and the receptor proteins to interact with one another , the two best-scored complexes were subjected to md simulation . all of the md simulations were done by gromacs 2018 package ( abraham et al. , ) and opls-aa force field ( jorgensen et al. , ) . the monomer form of each protein and also the docked complexes were placed in the center of a triclinic box with a distance of 1 nm from all edges and solvated with tip3p water model ( jorgensen et al. , ) . then , sodium and chloride ions were added to produce a neutral physiological salt concentration of 150 mm . each system was energy minimized , using the steepest descent algorithm , until the fmax was found to be smaller than 10 kj.mol-1nm-1 . all of the covalent bonds were constrained using the linear constraint solver ( lincs ) algorithm ( hess et al. , ) to maintain constant bond lengths . the long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh ewald ( pme ) method ( darden et al. , ; essmann et al. , ) and the cut off radii for coulomb and van der waals short-range interactions were set to 0.9 nm . then 100 ps nvt ( constant number of particles ( n ) , volume ( v ) , and temperature ( t ) ) and 300 ps npt ( constant number of particles ( n ) , pressure ( p ) , and temperature ( t ) ) equilibrations were performed for each system . after the necessary equilibrations , 100 ns of production run were performed for each of the four complexes . finally , simulations were carried out under the periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , set at xyz coordinates to ensure that the atoms had stayed inside the simulation box , and the subsequent analyses were then performed using gromacs utilities , vmd ( humphrey et al. , ) and uscf chimera , and also the plots and the figures were created using daniel 's xl toolbox ( v 7.3.2 ) add-in ( kraus , ) and ezmol ( reynolds et al. , ) . all of the computations were performed on an ubuntu desktop pc , with a [ intel ( r ) xeon ( r ) cpu e5-2630 v3 + nvidia geforce gtx 1080 ] configuration . \n\n mmpbsa binding free energy \n\n the binding free energies of the protein-protein complexes were calculated by molecular mechanics-poisson-boltzmann solvent-accessible surface area , mmpbsa method ( kollman et al. , ) using g_mmpbsa package ( kumari et al. , ) . in this method , the binding free energy is the result of the free energy of the complex minus the sum of the free energies of the ligand and the protein . in our case , the nom recombinant protein is defined as the ligand and the immune receptors are defined as the receptors . the mmpbsa calculation was done for every ns of each simulation trajectories . \n\n results and discussion \n\n defining t-cell epitopes \n\n the results of several studies have shown that strong virus-specific t-cell response is required for the elimination of respiratory virus infections such as sars-cov and influenza a and para-influenza . these studies conclude that future vaccine interventions should also consider strategies to enhance t cell response to provide robust long-term memory ( channappanavar et al. , ; janice oh et al. , ) . studies have shown that high levels of t cell responses against n protein were found 2 years after the patient 's recovery ( peng et al. , ) . antibodies are essential to combat sars-cov infection , and the body needs sars-cov specific cd4+ t helper cells to produce these specific antibodies . also , cd8+ cytotoxic t cells are important for recognizing and killing infected cells , especially in the lungs of infected individuals . we used the rankpep server which covers almost all hla supertypes to predicted different epitops from n , orf3a and m proteins sequence according to hla i and hla ii alleles . antigenic epitopes with high binding affinity score were predicted that are summarized in table 2a-b . \n\n antigen hla_a0201 hla_a0204 hla_a0206 hla_b0702 hla_b51 hla_b5401 hla_b5301 nucleocapsid protein 316-324 299-307 66-74 343-351 66-74 45-53 gmsrigmev

such as measles and rubella reflects the importance of protective antibodies . protection against virus infection such as coronaviruses depends on the simulation of neutralizing antibodies in addition to the t cell-mediated immunity . while cytotoxic lymphocytes can kill infected cells , antibodies have the potential to eliminate infected cells and prevent the infectious virus from infecting a cell ( neutralization ) . sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies block viral entry ( dorner & radbruch , ; hsueh et al. , ) . in this study , for the linear epitope prediction , the bepipred server was employed . bepipred analysis revealed several continuous predicted epitopes of n , orf3a and m proteins . for cross-checking the predicted epitopes , the sequence of all three proteins was also predicted by kolaskar & tongaonkar antigenicity . the linear b-cell epitopes are represented in ( table 3 ) . given that both cellular and humoral immune responses are essential against coronaviruses infection ( janice oh et al. , ) , finally , epitopes that were shared between b cell and t-cell were selected . \n\n selected targets for designing the final vaccine \n\n the main strategy in the present study was to design and construct a novel multi-epitope protein from covid-19 based on in silico methods to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses . due to the low immunogenicity of the epitope , we chose epitope-rich domains to generate a more diverse and robust response ( wieser et al. , ) . based on in silico analysis , five epitope-rich domains including highly scored and shared epitopes between t and b-cell epitopes were selected and joined to each other with a three aaa linker ( table 4 ) . the schematic diagram of designed vaccine domains with linker 's sites has been shown in figure 2 . \n\n the schematic diagram of the vaccine candidate construct consists of n , orf3a and m proteins epitopes of the covid-19 linked together with aaa linkers . \n\n antigen server

allergenicity \n\n prediction of the vaccine candidate antigenicity represents a numerical criterion for the capability of the vaccine to bind to the b- and t-cell receptors and increase the immune response in the host cell . vaxijen v2.0 was used to predict the antigenicity of the designed protein . vaxijen analysis of nom protein showed potent antigenicity 0.5999 with a 0.4 % threshold . the results indicate that the designed protein sequences without adjuvant are antigenic . \n\n allergen proteins induce an ige antibody response ( dimitrov et al. , ) . the designed vaccine candidate must not show an allergic reaction to the body . the allergenicity of the sequence was predicted using the allertop tool . based on prediction approaches in allertop , this protein was not recognized as an allergen . \n\n the physicochemical parameters and protein secondary structure prediction \n\n primary structure analysis nom designed protein ( 337 aa ) has a molecular weight of 37513.57 d. the total number of positively charged residues ( arg + lys ) and negatively charged residues ( asp + glu ) were 19 and 32 respectively . the theoretical isoelectric point ( pi ) was calculated at 9.62 . the instability index ( < 40 ) indicates that the designed protein has high stability for the initiation of an immunogenic reaction . the instability index ( ii ) was 35.75 which classifies the protein as stable . the aliphatic index of nom recombinant protein was calculated 97.92 and indicates this protein has stability in several temperatures . \n\n natively unfolded protein regions and alpha-helix are important forms of structural antigens that can be arranged in their native structure and thus identified by antibodies that are produced in response to infection . ( shey et al. , ) . the composition of the predicted secondary structure of the nom multi-epitope vaccine candidate was 43.92 % ( alpha helix ) , 16.02 % ( extended strand ) , and 40.06 % ( random coil ) . all this information indicates the designed protein is suitable as a vaccine candidate . \n\n tertiary structure prediction and validation \n\n three-dimensional structure was modeled by galaxyweb for our designed protein ( figure 3a ) . this model was used for evaluation and refinement . for validation of the model , prosa-web , ramachandran plot and molprobity were used that compare and analyze the protein structure . the prosa web determined z-score for the best predicted 3 d model ( figure 3b ) . the z-score of the nom predicted model was -4.42 , which is within the range of scores typically found for native proteins of similar size . the ramachandran plot indicates that most of the residues are found in the favored and allowed regions ( 99.7 % ) and only 0.3 % in the outlier region , this shows that the quality of the designed model is satisfactory . phe 282 , asn311 , tyr228 , lys194 , asp223 , ser229 , ser4 , his197 , tyr68 residues were observed in the allowed and outlier regions of ramachandran plot ( figure 3c ) . in molprobity analysis , the all-atom clash score was 9.37 , the molprobity score was 2.21 . all structural images were created using pymol ( the pymol molecular graphics system , version 1.1 , schrodinger , llc ) . \n\n ( a-c ) prediction and validation of tertiary structure of the nom recombinant protein using ( a ) prediction of the

conformational b-cell epitopes from vaccine protein using ellipro server . \n\n establishing the stability of the initial structures \n\n a vaccine can interact with different receptors of the immune system . we have docked designed final constructs ( nom ) with tlr4 and hla-a * 11:01 receptors . the interaction between these receptors and nom recombinant protein induce different immune responses . to achieve a stable and relaxed state of the nom recombinant protein and the immune receptors , a md simulation of 100 ns was performed for each structure . these simulations ensure that the structures are stable enough to be used for protein-protein molecular docking . after 100 ns of the production run , as it is shown in figure 5 , the rmsd ( root mean square distance ) values of the monomers show that the backbone structure of tlr4 ( pdb id : 2z62 ) is very rigid and stable . the structure of the nom recombinant protein also reached stability after about 25 ns after a considerable structural change . the backbone structure of the hla-a * 11:01 ( pdb id : 5wjl ) , however , showed big spikes in the rmsd values but all three structures were visually inspected and were considered stable enough for the next step of the project . \n\n the rmsd values of the simulated monomer forms of the proteins throughput the 100 ns of production runs . \n\n protein-protein molecular docking \n\n to find the best orientation for optimal interaction of the nom protein with the immune receptors we decided to use protein-protein molecular docking . we used patchdock webserver which concentrates on recognizing and matching patterns of the surfaces of the proteins to put them in the best possible positions . afterward , the top 10 best solutions were subjected to the firedock webserver to refine the docked structures . the firedock algorithms refine the docked complexes by side-chain rearrangement and soft rigid-body optimization . the ranking of the docked complexes is based on short-range , long-range , attractive and repulsive interaction energies between the residues of the two proteins , which are all summed up in the global energy or the binding energy of the complexes . we considered global energy as the main criterion for choosing the best complexes and chose the two top-scored solutions with the best global energy . as it is shown in table 6 , the solution numbers 5 and 6 from the nom-tlr4 complex and the solution numbers 2 and 3 , from nom-hla-a * 11:01 complex , were chosen for further calculations . the total energy plots of the simulations are shown in figure 6 . the results showed a strong interaction between designed protein amino acids and receptors . the interactions between the binding receptors and the docked nom protein were visualized using the ucsf chimera program . residues of hla-a * 1101 ( glu53 , asn174 , gly56 , asn174 , glu53 , pro57 ) participated in the interaction with arg49 , ser97 , gln91 ,

simulation of top scored solutions \n\n after the protein-protein molecular docking , 4 solutions were chosen for md simulation , solution numbers 2 and 3 from nom protein-hla-a * 11:01 complex and solution numbers 5 and 6 from nom protein-tlr4 complex . each was simulated for 100 ns . to examine their stability throughout the simulations period , the rmsd values of each protein was analyzed . as it is shown in figure 7 , each protein has different rmsd values and in some of them , the backbone atoms have considerable movements during the simulations . the reason is that the interactions can get optimized and rearranged by introducing water molecules and physiological conditions . the rmsd values of tlr4 in nom protein-tlr4 complexes and the values of hla-a * 11:01 in nom protein-hla-a * 11:01 complexes are very stable and the average values do not reach very high values . however , the rmsd values of the nom protein in every complex reach high values which means that the structure of the vaccine has more movements to refine the interactions with the immune receptors . however , the interactions between the nom recombinant protein and the immune receptors are quite strong and mmpbsa binding energy calculations exhibit great binding energies . as it is shown in table 7 , the van der waals and electrostatic energies of the complexes are strong enough to keep the two proteins in contact with each other . moreover , the deviation of each value is very small which means that the interactions are very stable and consistent throughout the simulations . in another word , the higher scale of rmsd values with consistent binding energies only show that the structure of the nom protein is well optimized for interacting with the immune receptors . \n\n the rmsd

the proteins , we decided to perform rmsf ( root mean square fluctuation ) analysis . in this analysis , the average value of fluctuation of each residue during the simulation is plotted , figure 8 . as it is shown in figure 8a , the rmsf values of nom recombinant protein in five simulations indicate that the fluctuation of the monomer form of the vaccine in many regions is considerably more than the complex forms . this is a direct indication that the nom recombinant protein is much more stable when it is in complex with the two immune receptors . furthermore , the rmsf values of the nom recombinant protein in complex with hla-a * 11:01 are lower compared with that of nom recombinant protein in complex with tlr4 . also , with the evidence that the binding energies are also lower , we can conclude that nom recombinant protein can bind to the hla-a * 11:01 better than the other immune receptor . \n\n the rmsf values of each protein in the simulated complexes compared to the simulated monomer forms of the proteins throughout the 100 ns of production runs . a , the comparison of the rmsf values of nom recombinant protein in the complexes with the monomer form . b , the

the graphical illustration of the monomer forms and the complex forms of the nom recombinant protein and the hla-a * 11:01 and tlr4 immune receptors . \n\n in figure 8b and figure 8c , the rmsf values of the monomer forms of the immune receptors show lower values compared to the complex forms . this behavior is exactly the opposite of the nom designed protein . this can be an indication that the structures are very stable in their natural function and their structures considerably change when they get into contact with the designed nom protein . furthermore , the structural illustration of the monomer forms and also the complex forms of the vaccine and the immune receptors , figure 9 , shows that the vaccine can fill the cavities and bind tightly to them , as it was proved by the binding energies . \n\n conclusion \n\n covid-19 pandemic is much more than a health crisis . it leads to a political , social and economic crisis in the world . the development of a safe and effective vaccine could reduce the rate of this infection . immunoinformatics methods are valuable in reducing time and cost in vaccine design and other fields of life sciences . we have predicted and validated nom recombinant protein against hla-a * 11:01 and tlr4 receptors . our evaluation was based on vaccine candidate structural analysis and molecular docking and md simulations study . the nom-tlr4 and nom-hla-a * 11:01 complexes were very stable in their natural function with strong molecular interactions in around 100 ns . higher binding energy even after the md simulation of 100 ns confirmed the stability and specificity nom-tlr4 and nom- hla-a * 11:01 interaction . our vaccine candidate can stimulate both cellular and humoral immunity , given that b and t-cell epitopes have been selected in the final construct . taken all together , according to physicochemical evaluations as well as structural and immunological analyses , nom recombinant protein could be considered as a possible vaccine candidate against covid-19 . \n\n acknowledgements \n\n this work was supported by the hormozgan university of medical sciences under grant [ number : hums-rec.1398.647 ] , bandar

february , 2020 , china has 70 635 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , including 1772 deaths [ 1 ] . human-to-human spread of the virus via respiratory droplets is currently considered to be the main route of transmission . however , exhaled air dispersion during non-invasive respiratory support may increase the risk of coronavirus transmission , and requires more attention from medical personnel and patients . \n\n non-invasive respiratory support plays an essential role in the treatment of covid-19 . more awareness is needed of viral transmission through exhaled air . http : //bit.ly/39knrrf \n\n to the editor : \n\n as of 17 february , 2020 , china has 70 635 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , including 1772 deaths . human-to-human spread of the virus via respiratory droplets is currently considered to be the main route of transmission . however , exhaled air dispersion during non-invasive respiratory support may increase the risk of coronavirus transmission , and requires more attention from medical personnel and patients . \n\n according to the chinese centre for disease control and prevention , among 72 314 reported cases in mainland china ( 44 672 confirmed cases , 16 186 suspected cases , 10 567 clinically diagnosed cases , and 889 asymptomatic infected cases ) as of 11 february , 1716 medical staff were infected . notably , wang et al . analysed the clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalised cases with covid-19 and found that the nosocomial infection rate in the study was about 41.3 % , with 17 inpatients and 40 medical staff . given the high use of respiratory support to treat dyspnoea and respiratory failure induced by covid-19 , viral transmission through exhaled air should be considered . \n\n when oxygen is delivered through nasal catheter , mask or non-invasive ventilation ( niv ) , substantial exhaled air is released into the air , which can increase dispersion of the virus , and subsequently increase the risk of nosocomial infection . prior studies have suggested that the application of high-flow nasal cannula ( hfnc ) , niv through the specific mask with optimised vent holes or the helmet with a double-limb circuit may lower the risk of airborne transmission . performing non-invasive respiratory support in a single , well-ventilated , negative pressure ward is also considered a safe option . currently , however , the majority of patients are still receiving respiratory support through nasal catheter or common mask in general wards or emergency departments with limited medical resources . the potential for airborne transmission in this population has not received enough attention . furthermore , a significant proportion of suspected patients with mild to no symptoms who are managing at home may also require long-term home oxygen or niv treatment ( e.g . patients with advanced staged copd ) . these patients may increase the risk of family cluster infections by the widespread dispersion of exhaled air in their homes . \n\n non-invasive respiratory support plays an essential role in the treatment of covid-19 , and more awareness is needed regarding the increased risk of viral transmission from exhaled air . medical staff should utilise personal protective equipment when providing respiratory support therapy . patients should wear a medical mask when receiving conventional oxygen therapy or hfnc in order to reduce air dispersion . when performing niv therapy , because helmet resources are limited and they are not frequently used in routine clinical practice , we suggest avoiding masks with vent holes and adding a filter between the mask and the vent valve to reduce viral transmission . patient beds should be at least 1 m from one another and the ward air circulation rate needs to be increased . for patients with suspected covid-19 infection receiving long-term respiratory support at home , it is recommended that they stay in a single , well-ventilated room to avoid potentially infecting their family members . \n\n shareable pdf \n\n conflict of interest : l. guan has nothing to disclose .

00010010	early in the epidemic : impact of preprints on global discourse about covid-19 transmissibility \n\n since it was first reported by who in jan 5 , 2020 , over 80 000 cases of a novel coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) have been diagnosed in china , with exportation events to nearly 90 countries , as of march 6 , 2020 . given the novelty of the causative pathogen ( named sars-cov-2 ) , scientists have rushed to fill epidemiological , virological , and clinical knowledge gaps : resulting in over 50 new studies about the virus between january 10 and january 30 alone . however , in an era where the immediacy of information has become an expectation of decision makers and the general public alike , many of these studies have been shared first in the form of preprint papers : before peer review . \n\n for the past three decades , preprint servers have become commonplace in the scientific publication ecosystem , and covid-19 has prompted a seemingly unprecedented use of these platforms . although peer-review is crucial for the validation of science , the ongoing outbreak has showcased the speed with which preprints can disseminate information during emergencies . in this comment , we used both preprint and peer-reviewed studies that estimated the transmissibility potential ( ie , basic reproduction number [ r 0 ] ) of sars-cov-2 on or before feb 1 , 2020 to investigate the role that preprints have had in information dissemination during the ongoing outbreak . we also analysed the agreement of preprint estimates compared with those presented by peer-reviewed studies and propose a consensus-based approach for evaluating the validity of preprint findings during public health crises . for our analysis , we collected publicly available data from scientific studies , news reports , and search trends pertaining to sars-cov-2 and its r 0 . defined as the average number of secondary infections that a new case might transmit in a fully susceptible population , estimates of r 0 can provide decision makers with insights into the epidemic potential of a given outbreak . \n\n relevant news reports were discovered through mediacloud and search trends by use of google search trends , and both served as a proxy indicator for information dissemination . meanwhile , relevant scientific studies were discovered through a combination of searches executed with use of google scholar and , to address possible delays in indexing , four popular public preprint servers ( ie , arxiv , biorxiv , medrxiv , and social science research network [ ssrn ] ) that we believe are representative of the relevant preprint literature . search terms and specifications for each data source are outlined in the appendix ( p 2 ) . all studies discovered through google scholar , arxiv , biorxiv , medrxiv , and ssrn were manually checked for relevance to the topic area of interest . we retained only studies that included estimates for the r 0 associated with sars-cov-2 in the body of the text . \n\n r0 mean and range estimates from 11 different studies of covid-19 as a function of time \n\n for preprints that were revised before publication of the first relevant peer-reviewed study on jan 29 , the version number is indicated between parentheses as ( n ) . when multiple r0 estimates were presented in a single study because of the use of multiple approaches , the version number is followed by a single decimal place to indicate the approach used ( n.n ) . if a first author published more than one relevant independent study before feb 1 , the version number is followed immediately by an alphabetical marker ordered by date of publication ( nx ) . ranges presented vary by study ( eg , 95 % ci , 95 % credible interval , and so on ) and are presented in the appendix ( p 3 ) . r0=basic reproduction number . \n\n after this initial data discovery phase , which yielded 11 individual studies , date of first publication , publication platform , review status ( ie , preprint vs peer-reviewed ) , and methodological details were manually curated from each study ( appendix p 3 ) . r 0 estimates were also extracted from each study for further analysis . in the event of multiple r 0 estimates : because of preprint revisions after the first version or the use of multiple approaches in a single study : each estimate was recorded and treated as a separate entry to represent all available knowledge at any given point in time ( appendix p 3 ) . given that the first known preprint estimates for r 0 were posted to ssrn by us on jan 23 , we plotted search trend fractions and news report volume between jan 23 and feb 1 ( appendix p 4 ) . baseline data for both sources before jan 23 , 2020 , yielded negligible search trend interest and news report volume , and data collected up to feb 9 , 2020 , showed diminishing interest and volume after the catchment window ( appendix p 4 ) . to illustrate when each of the 11 relevant studies became available to the public , indicator bars were overlaid against the search trend and news report data by date of publication ( appendix p 4 ) . we then plotted each of the 16 r 0 estimates produced by the 11 studies , including both the mean and the estimate range ( eg , 95 % ci , 95 % credible interval , and so on ) presented ( appendix p 3 ) . estimates were plotted by date of publication and alphabetically there-in , offering a side-by-side comparison of preprint versus peer-reviewed results ; averages and 95 % cis were also computed for both groups ( figure ) . \n\n google search trends and mediacloud data suggested that both general ( ie , search ) interest and news media interest in the r 0 associated with covid-19 peaked before the publication of relevant peer-reviewed studies during the early stages of the epidemic . in the selected time frame , search interest peaked on jan 27 after a sharp increase between jan 23 and jan 25 immediately after the publication of five early preprint studies : all of which estimated r 0 : in biorxiv , medrxiv , and ssrn . meanwhile , news media interest peaked on jan 28 , coinciding with a sixth preprint study published in arxiv ( appendix p 4 ) . the first peer-reviewed estimates were then published by li and colleagues in the new england journal of medicine on jan 29 at 17:00 h ( eastern standard time ) , followed by four additional peer-reviewed studies in eurosurveillance , the international journal of infectious diseases , the lancet , and journal of clinical medicine up to feb 1 . average r 0 estimates across the preprint group were 3 61 ( 95 % ci 2 77-4 45 ) and 2 54 ( 2 17-2 91 ) across the peer-reviewed group : showing overlap in 95 % cis despite a wide diversity of modelling methods and data sources used both in-group and across-group ( appendix p 3 ) . although the average mean for the preprint group was higher than that for the peer-reviewed group , this effect was driven primarily by two upper-limit outlier estimates ( with r 0 higher than the 95 % ci maximum ; figure ) . exclusion of these two estimates by use of a consensus-based approach based on the 95 % cis yielded an average r 0 estimate of 3 02 ( 95 % ci 2 65-3 39 ) for the preprint group . notably , two studies in the peer-reviewed group had previously been published as preprints . although estimates presented by riou and althaus remained unchanged after peer review , estimates presented by zhao and colleagues were higher before peer review than afterwards . \n\n our findings suggest that , because of the speed of their release , preprints : rather than peer-reviewed literature in the same topic area : might be driving discourse related to the ongoing covid-19 outbreak . although our analysis focused on search trends and news media data as a measure for general discourse , it is likely that preprints are also influencing policy making discussions , given that who announced on jan 26 , 2020 , that they would be creating a repository of relevant studies : including those that have not yet been peer-reviewed . \n\n nevertheless , despite the advantages of speedy information delivery , the lack of peer review can also translate into issues of credibility and misinformation , both intentional and unintentional . this particular drawback has been highlighted during the ongoing outbreak , especially after the high-profile withdrawal of a virology study from the preprint server biorxiv , which erroneously claimed that covid-19 contained hiv `` insertions '' . the very fact that this study was withdrawn showcases the power of open peer-review during emergencies ; the withdrawal itself appears to have been prompted by outcry from dozens of scientists from around the globe who had access to the study because it was placed on a public server . much of this outcry was documented on twitter ( a microblogging platform ) and on longer-form popular science blogs , signalling that such fora would serve as rich additional data sources for future work on the impact of preprints on public discourse . however , instances such as this one described showcase the need for caution when acting upon the science put forth by any one preprint . \n\n with this in mind , taking multiple studies into consideration as presented in our analysis can help operationalise the kind of caution necessitated by preprints while simultaneously allowing for important , robust insights before the publication of a peer-reviewed study in the same topic area . here , we used a simple method in which we plotted the ten r 0 estimates that were posted as preprints before publication of the first peer-reviewed study on jan 29 ; we then took the average of these estimates and excluded the two estimates that qualified as upper-limit outliers : both upon visual inspection and as a function of the 95 % ci . even before outlier elimination , this simple method yielded average r 0 estimates similar to those presented by the peer-reviewed studies subsequently published on and after jan 29 ; however , more complex approaches that incorporate weighted averages based on estimate confidence , similar to traditional meta-analytical methods , offer a promising avenue for future work . such collective , consensus-based approaches will arguably be easiest to use when the research of interest is quantitative in nature ; nevertheless , given that many crucial epidemiological parameters that inform decision making ( eg , incubation period , generation time , and so on ) are quantitative , our proposed approach could work well in these contexts as well . \n\n our work showcases the powerful role preprints can have during public health crises because of the timeliness with which they can disseminate new information . furthermore , given that two of the preprints included in this analysis were later published in peer-reviewed outlets , the evidence shows that that even prestigious journals now permit the sharing of important findings before peer review and that the use of preprint platforms does not jeopardise future peer-reviewed publication . without question , primacy and peer-reviewed publications are key metrics in individual professional advancement ( eg , academic promotion ) ; nevertheless , the impact of preprints on discourse and decision making pertaining to the ongoing covid-19 outbreak suggests that we must rethink how we reward and recognise community contributions during present and future public health crises . \n\n references \n\n\n\n

10000000	clinical progression of covid-19 patient with extended incubation period , delayed rt-pcr time-to-positivity , and potential role of chest ct-scan . \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , previously called 2019-ncov , is a novel disease caused by sars- cov-2 which was first identified as outbreak of unknown respiratory illness in wuhan , china . covid- 19 was declared as global health emergency by who on march 11 , 2020 and quickly elevated to global pandemic on 11 march 2020 . covid-19 symptom is highly various in each patient , with fever , fatigue , shortness of breath , and cough as the main presenting symptoms . patient with covid-19 may shows severe symptom with severe pneumonia and ards , mild symptom resembling simple upper respiration tract infection , or even completely asymptomatic . approximately 80 % of cases is mild . however the number may changes as more people are getting tested . some experts are estimating that up to 50 % of all cases may be asymptomatic carrier . 
01100000	potential cytoprotective activity of ozone therapy in sars-cov-2/covid-19 . \n\n ( 1 ) background : the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) disease ( covid-19 ) in china at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak . systemic ozone therapy ( ot ) could be potentially useful in the clinical management of several complications secondary to sars-cov-2 . the rationale and mechanism of action has already been proven clinically in other viral infections and has been shown in research studies to be highly effective at decreasing organ damage mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress . this review summarizes the ot studies that illustrate the possible cytoprotective mechanism of action of ozone and its physiological by-products in target organs affected by sars-cov-2 . ( 2 ) methods : this review encompasses a total of 74 peer-reviewed original articles . it is mainly focused on ozone as a modulator of the nf-kappa b/nrf2 pathways and il-6/il-1beta expression . ( 3 ) results : in experimental models and the few existent clinical studies , homeostasis of the free radical and antioxidant balance by ot was associated with a modulation of nf-kappa b/nrf2 balance and il-6 and il-1beta expression . these molecular mechanisms support the cytoprotective effects of ot against tissue damage present in many inflammatory diseases , including viral infections . ( 4 ) conclusions : the potential cytoprotective role of ot in the management of organ damage induced by covid-19 merits further research . controlled clinical trials are needed . 
01001000	perspective from ecuador , the second country with more confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in south america : a review \n\n to face the pandemic outbreak of a novel coronavirus many countries developed a series of containment methods ; however , developing countries in south america had reacted apathetically to this worldwide concern . ecuador 's response to the novel virus coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) started on february 26 , 2020 , one month after the outbreak began in china . as of today , the countries with more confirmed cases in south america are brazil and ecuador . although brazil has two times the number of cases than ecuador ( brazil : 700 cases per 100000 people vs. ecuador : 400 cases per 100000 ) , the huge population difference between the two countries raises concerns about the public health policies implemented by the ecuadorian government . even though there is no cure for covid-19 , chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are promising alternatives . the covid-19 pandemic outbreak has shown that there is room for improvement in the healthcare systems worldwide and the disastrous results on the fragile often unprepared are those systems in developing countries . \n\n introduction and background \n\n alarm bells over the world started to ring after the news regarding a case of pneumonia caused by a novel virus in wuhan , china . the virus supposedly originated in one of the largest markets in wuhan . on january 7 , 2020 , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) isolated the virus and called it severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) . the disease caused by this virus was named coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) by the world health organization ( who ) . \n\n even though the majority of cases present with flu-like symptoms , 3.4 % of patients develop severe pneumonia , septic shock , respiratory failure , and multiorgan failure leading to a fatal outcome . \n\n on january 30 , 2020 , the who declared the covid-19 outbreak a global health emergency . countries applied many measures , hoping to contain the spread of the disease ; for example , restricting mobility and quarantines . additionally , incoming flights from countries with a high prevalence of the disease were suspended , first from china and then followed by italy and spain . \n\n in south america , brazil is the country with the highest number of covid-19-confirmed cases followed by ecuador . although brazil has two times the number of cases than ecuador , it is important to analyze the prevalence of the disease in the context of the countries ' population . while brazil , with a population of 212,559,417 , has a total of 1,549 confirmed cases ( 0.007 % ) ; ecuador , with a population of 17,567,751 , has 789 confirmed cases ( 0.004 % ) . the greater ratio of cases per population in ecuador raises the concern about the efficacy of the containment measures and public health policies taken by the country . \n\n the limitations of the healthcare systems in developing countries increase their chances of being affected more during a pandemic outbreak . \n\n review \n\n confirmed cases and ecuadorian response \n\n after the announcement that covid-19 was spreading rapidly across asian countries , european countries went into an alarm state and started to design containment measures while south american countries reacted apathetically , delaying decisions on preventive measures , underestimating the severity of the events . \n\n ecuador 's response to the novel virus covid-19 started on february 26 , 2020 . the set of measures included monitoring the temperature and other covid-19-related symptoms in travelers from high-risk countries . on february 29 , 2020 , ecuador confirmed the first case of covid-19 . the patient had arrived from spain two weeks before the diagnosis was made . \n\n after the who declared covid-19 as a pandemic outbreak on march 11 , 2020 , ecuador declared a national health emergency . all non-essential activities were suspended indefinitely and the use of virtual platforms was encouraged for academic activities , jobs , and medical care . as did other countries did , ecuador also closed its land , air , and sea borders to citizens and non-citizens for 21 days . restrictions to vehicular or pedestrian traffic and a national curfew from 7 pm to 5 am also took place . \n\n despite these measures , the virus continued spreading across the ecuadorian provinces . on march 23 , 2020 , 789 confirmed patients with covid-19 and 18 deaths related to the virus were reported by the ministry of health of ecuador . the mortality rate was similar to other countries . the number of confirmed patients increased , so did the number of people in epidemiological monitoring and quarantine . \n\n the infection risk in physicians also increases in countries with a high prevalence of sars-cov-2 . in italy , more than 3,000 health providers were infected becoming an increasing concern among health providers worldwide . in ecuador , 24 doctors have been tested positive for the virus one month after the first patient 's admission with covid-19 . the rising number of physicians testing positive for covid-19 raises concern amid a growing outcry over the shortage of protective equipment and medical supplies . \n\n guayas , with 607 confirmed cases , is by far the most affected province by covid-19 in ecuador . measures applied in the rest of the country with relative success failed in this province . the out-of-control increase in confirmed cases poses the risk of collapsing the health care system there . this situation led the government to declare the province as a national security zone , leaving operational planning to the army . \n\n transmission \n\n the transmission was described as animal-to-person in affected patients at the huanan seafood wholesale market of wuhan . at the moment , person-to-person transmission and fomite transmission have been linked with the spread of the illness . li compiled information on the dynamics of the novel virus , estimating a transmission rate of r0 2.2 for covid-19 . in addition , cascella mentions that close contact with an infected person is needed to transmit the virus . therefore , relatives and health professionals are at greater risk . \n\n there are some discrepancies about the transmission . while some studies support the animal-to-human transmission , including a case of a pet that tested positive for covid-19 , the cdc states that there is no evidence that pets can transmit the virus or present the symptomology of infection . \n\n prevention \n\n the main goal in the control of a pandemic outbreak is to achieve r0 less than 1 ( one positive patient can infect less than one extra person ) . to reach this goal , prevention is paramount . \n\n the who and cdc recommend avoiding contact with symptomatic people and agglomerations . basic hygiene practices , such as constant hand washing and the use of face masks in symptomatic patients , are also recommended to prevent the spread of the virus . \n\n many countries utilized quarantine and mobilization restrictions to control the spread ; however , these measures may not be sufficient in developing countries such as ecuador . \n\n pathophysiology \n\n the cause of covid-19 is a ribonucleic acid ( rna ) virus of the coronaviridae family called sars-cov-2 . although the exact pathophysiology of sars-cov-2 is unknown , its structural similarity with other viruses of the coronaviridae family allows an understanding of its dynamics and the evolution of the disease . the clinical presentation may vary from flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia similar to sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n channappanavar and granlinski mention that the most aggressive strains of the coronavirinae family , like sars-cov , have protein e in their envelope that stimulates nf-kb , a protein complex involved in cellular responses , including stress , cytokine signaling , response to viral infections , and apoptosis . protein e , along with other proteins , interferes with the host immune response ( tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) alpha and interleukin 6 ( il-6 ) ) . these processes produce uncontrolled inflammation , resulting in lung edema and fibrosis . \n\n treatment \n\n efforts to control covid-19 had been made by many countries , starting with investigations to develop a vaccine from the attenuated or inactive virus . the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases announced the beginning of the first trial on 45 volunteers between 18 and 55 years old . this first phase is estimated to last for six weeks . the kaiser research institute is evaluating the feasibility of the mrna-1723 vaccine . \n\n the management of patients with acute respiratory syndrome consists of assisted oxygen ventilation to achieve a saturation percentage of oxygen ( spo2 ) of 90 % and antipyretics . \n\n multiple drugs are being studied to treat covid-19 , with promising results . in the united states and china , a randomized clinical trial has been initiated to test the efficacy of remdesivir . at the moment , oseltamivir , a neuraminidase inhibitor , has been used more extensively . \n\n chloroquine , a drug used worldwide , has a promising effect in the treatment of severe pneumonia by covid-19 at a dose of 500 mg2 times a day ; however , zhou questions its use due to its side effects . instead of using chloroquine , zhou suggests hydroxychloroquine as an alternative treatment . hydroxychloroquine seems to attenuate the progression to more severe scenarios of covd-19 infection , although its dosage still needs further study . \n\n conclusions \n\n the low mortality of covid-19 may be the reason for developing countries underestimating the magnitude of this pandemic outbreak . the health care systems risk collapsing due to the increasing number of confirmed patients who need intensive care and the spread of the disease in health providers . the high demand for financial and human resources by this disease leads to a collateral increase in mortality from other causes . the covid-19 pandemic outbreak has shown that there is still room for improvement in healthcare systems worldwide to prevent its catastrophic impact , especially on the fragile and often unprepared systems in developing countries . \n\n the authors have declared that no competing interests exist . \n\n references \n\n cnn . ? cual es la tasa de mortalidad del coronavirus ?

10000000	multistage ct features of coronavirus disease 2019 . \n\n objectives : to determine imaging features of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in different stages , and to provide foundations for early diagnosis and treatment . methods : ct image data of 187 covid-19 patients were analyzed in the period of hospitalization . ct scanning was performed on admission and repeated every 3 days . the improvement time of clinical symptoms and the image changes of follow-up ct were statistically analyzed . results : all 187 patients ' nucleic acid test were positive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) . the early ct images of lung in 187 cases ( 100 % ) showed multiple patchy and ground-glass opacities with fine mesh and consolidation shade , which mainly distributed in pulmonary band or under the pleura . in the progressive stage , the pulmonary lesions in 146 cases ( 78.1 % ) were mainly consolidation , accompanied by air bronchogram , thickening of blood vessels , and interstitial changes . severe pulmonary ct images in 15 cases ( 8 % ) showed diffuse lesions in both lungs , displaying consolidation , or `` white lung '' . the ct imaging features in 185 cases ( 98.9 % ) at the absorptive period showed that the lesions diminished and fibrogenesis . the imaging features of 6 times of lung ct examination in one case showed continuous progress . the original lesion in one case was obviously absorbed , but new lesions appeared under the pleura of both lungs at the third review of ct scanning . the changes of ct imaging lesions during follow-up were significantly different in different clinical symptoms improvement time ( p < 0.01 ) . conclusions : images of covid-19 in various stages have special characteristics . the change of clinical symptoms is synchronous with the change of reexamination ct . follow-up ct can reflect the trend of clinical changes . repeat ct examination plays an important role in the early clinical diagnosis and the evaluation for the therapeutic effect on covid-19 patient .

00000100	covid-19 pneumonia with hemoptysis : acute segmental pulmonary emboli associated with novel coronavirus infection . \n\n recent retrospective studies from wuhan , china suggest novel coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) may be associated with a hypercoagulable state and increased risk for venous thromboembolism . the overlap in the signs and symptoms of covid-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) and covid-19 with concurrent pulmonary embolism creates a diagnostic challenge for emergency medicine physicians in patients already at risk for renal impairment . however , identifying features atypical for covid-19 alone may play a role in the judicious use of computed tomography angiography among these patients . hemoptysis is seen in roughly 13 % of pulmonary embolism cases and infrequently reported among covid-19 infections . additionally , the presence of right heart strain on electrocardiography ( ekg ) is a well described clinical presentations of pulmonary embolism not reported commonly with covid-19 infections . 
00000001	a uk-wide british society of thoracic imaging covid-19 imaging repository and database : design , rationale and implications for education and research \n\n introduction \n\n the number of cases of covid-19 continues to rise in the uk and around the world . the precise role for computed tomography ( ct ) in the diagnosis and triage of suspected cases , assessing for complications , and surveillance is subject to change and are explored in other articles in this edition ; however , keeping the uk diagnostic community fully informed of emerging guidance during the covid-19 outbreak is critical . this can be achieved as a collaborative effort by feeding a central library of the medical examples encountered and rapidly sharing expert opinions to frontline medical care staff , nationally and internationally . \n\n the british society of thoracic imaging ( bsti ) , in conjunction with cimar uk 's imaging cloud technology ( cimar.co.uk ) , have designed , built , and deployed a simple , free to use , anonymised , and encrypted online portal to upload and refer imaging of patients with either confirmed or suspected covid-19 . from these cases , the bsti are providing an imaging database of known uk patient examples for reference and teaching . the aim is to disseminate breaking clinical and diagnostic advice rapidly to frontline healthcare staff nationally , using real imaging examples encountered across the country . \n\n all imaging and supporting data are stored at uk cloud ( https : //ukcloudhealth.com ) with no identifiable metadata . imaging can be uploaded at http : //bit.ly/bsticovid19_database . the published teaching library and its content will be accessible without a login via the bsti website ( https : //bit.ly/bsticovid19_teaching_library ) . \n\n the role of registries in radiology \n\n registry data can be essential in the development of radiology diagnosis and shared learning . they have sometimes changed practice , for example , the identification of high rates of morbidity in patients undergoing emergency biliary procedures via the swedish registry gallriks , and complications in vascular surgery via vascular registries . \n\n the royal college of radiologists document `` setting up a regional or national digital teaching archive '' makes clear that such databases are needed for developing the knowledge and skills of radiology trainees , but would also significantly benefit trained radiologists . this is perhaps even more pertinent in the face of a new virus whose imaging features can be varied and unfamiliar . indeed , it has long been recognised that breaking down technological barriers to contributing imaging studies directly from a picture archiving and communications system ( pacs ) viewer to a central imaging repository would make teaching and research in the national health service ( nhs ) more efficient and accurate . overcoming such a bottleneck would also deliver the potential to exponentially upskill the radiology workforce in the early and accurate diagnosis of covid-19 , in what is currently a highly dynamic situation . by bringing together thoracic ct expertise across the uk , a central covid-19 imaging repository and database can help reduce unwarranted diagnostic variation , provide better quality care for patients , and provide a resource to accumulate knowledge rapidly . such a database would also allow real-time tracking of confirmed ct cases and allow improved understanding of the significance of cases with positive ct findings , but negative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( rt-pcr ) results . this will help collate valuable information for the nhs and public health england . \n\n technical aspects and registry design \n\n refer a case ( upload link ) : https : //bit.ly/bsticovid19_database . \n\n teaching library access : https : //bit.ly/bsticovid19_teaching_library . \n\n the platform is provided free of cost by cimar.co.uk , a uk-hosted cloud-pacs and image sharing service , ( powered by ambra health inc. technology ) . more than 9 billion images are hosted globally by this cloud , across 55 countries , connecting thousands of hospitals and imaging sites for over 700 clinical trials . the service is increasingly used by the nhs to solve imaging storage , interoperability , and rapid sharing needs . referred cases can be uploaded from any hospital or location . they will then be routed through a restricted access workflow to a panel of bsti diagnostic experts for approval and annotation , prior to general access to healthcare professionals being granted . all cases will be automatically anonymised by the cloud-software at the point of upload and access does not require changes to individual/organisation firewalls . all connections are secure and encrypted ( https/tls1.2 ) . no hardware is required . \n\n users can view the published teaching library , diagnostic observations , and training materials online using chrome , firefox , safari , apple or pc machines , as well as any other browser or mobile device . a diagnostic food and drug administration ( fda ) approved html5 viewer loads automatically for the user , so no special software , downloads , or installations are required to access and use the resource . \n\n the requirement for data protection impact assessment ( dpia ) forms will be the decision of each individual trust ; however , completed and signed-off dpia from the royal united hospitals bath , nhs foundation trust , is available as a template if required ( see electronic supplementary material appendix s1 ) . a `` frequently asked questions '' document is also available ( see electronic supplementary material appendix s2 ) . it is also now noted that the information commissioner has assured nhsx that she can not envisage a situation where she would take action against a health or care professional clearly trying to deliver care related to the covid-19 crisis . all data is anonymised from the point of upload through to its viewing . the full dataset will only be viewable by the bsti covid-19 imaging repository and database panel ( and other agreed parties with suitable clinical expertise ; the software has role-based access only ) . from the core imaging repository and database , teaching material will be published and refreshed on a regular basis . the imaging will only be stored for as long as the bsti executive committee deems it necessary . for bsti-appointed expert panel members , access to the full dataset is through a pre-registered login with a strong ( forced renewable ) password . access is audited , captured , and all usage is logged . the published teaching library and its content can be accessed without a login as a freely accessible teaching resource for radiologists . \n\n the bsti covid-19 registry : education \n\n the reported chest radiography and ct signs in covid-19 vary depending upon time of imaging from symptom onset and disease severity . patients with covid-19 may present to any hospital initially and radiologists have a duty to be aware of findings that are compatible with the diagnosis . there is a national shortage of radiologists , with the current shortfall estimated to be 1,104 . of existing radiologists , `` chest/lung '' is the fifth most popular subspecialty interest , but the provision of subspecialty thoracic radiology also varies dramatically across the uk . the bsti aim to produce a resource that helps to upskill all radiologists in the evolving clinical climate of covid-19 . in addition , webinars using content from the bsti covid-19 database are planned in conjunction with the royal college of radiologists . \n\n the bsti covid-19 database : research \n\n as of 8 march 2020 , there were 585 published articles on pubmed ( https : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed ) using the search phrase `` covid-19 '' . the world health organization has set covid-19 research as a priority . the largest imaging study in covid-19 ( in more than 1,000 patients from china ) raised the question of the role of ct in diagnosis , particularly in patients who are at high clinical risk , but had a negative initial real-time rt-pcr for the virus ; however , as the authors acknowledge , `` clinical and laboratory data were limited during this urgent period when regional hospitals were overloaded '' . consequently , it is uncertain if the ct findings are simply an epiphenomenon of the clinical or laboratory findings . through a united effort to submit cases to the bsti covid-19 imaging repository and database across the entire nhs , there is a real opportunity to add to the evidence base in the diagnosis and risk stratification of cases . the case upload with be accompanied by brief clinic metrics ( including patient age , sex , white cell count , c-reactive protein , p02 , indication for the imaging , rt-pcr status , prior imaging ) , which will help understand the temporal trends in imaging and the relevance of imaging findings in the context of known clinical and laboratory data . \n\n unfortunately , covid-19 is now a global pandemic , and the database has the potential to rapidly upscale to host nested registries for other countries and provide a global imaging perspective . all contributors will be considered collaborators on research outputs . \n\n summary \n\n for the bsti covid-19 imaging repository and database to realise its potential in education and research in the uk and across the globe , we call on all radiologists to engage and upload cases . every case of covid-19 counts . \n\n conflict of interest \n\n the authors declare no conflict of interest . \n\n references \n\n an update on covid-19 for the radiologist : a british society of thoracic imaging statement \n\n a statement from the british society of thoracic imaging statement : considerations in designing local imaging diagnostic algorithms \n\n mortality after a cholecystectomy : a population-based study \n\n vascular services quality improvement programme \n\n\n\n the royal college of radiologists \n\n world health authority . world experts and funders set priorities for covid-19 research \n\n correlation of chest ct and rt-pcr testing in coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in china : a report of 1014 cases \n\n supplementary data \n\n the following are the supplementary data to this article : \n\n supplementary data to this article can be found online at https : //doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2020.03.005 . 
00000100	how do we decide to de-isolate covid-19 patients ? \n\n since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in december 2019 , the number of individuals affected by the disease has rapidly risen . it has been suggested that the disease is contagious during the incubation period in infected patients . however , the duration for which the disease remains contagious in the patients is not known . it is not known as to how and when can a decision be made to de-isolate these patients to avoid the transmission of the causative virus i.e . severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) . serial collections of oropharyngeal swab and sputum specimens are recommended by the taiwan centers for disease control and prevention ( taiwan cdc ) to detect sars-cov-2 from the upper airways in covid-19 patients . based on this , we hypothesized that virus detection from the upper airways may have a direct correlation with the possibility of transmission . in this study , we observed the clinical course and presence of sars-cov-2 rna in serial collections of specimens from the upper airways of two patients with covid-19 . \n\n clinical course of the wife and the husband with covid-19 and the threshold cycle ( ct ) values of rrt-pcr for sars-cov-2 in their oropharyngeal swab and saliva specimens . \n\n fig . 1 \n\n on january 28 , 2020 , a previously healthy non-smoking 44-year-old female , visited the out-patient clinic at the hospital . the patient complained of having a fever and headache since january 27 , 2020 ( fig . 1 ) . physical examinations revealed a body temperature of 39.3 c , and an oxygen saturation of 96 % in room air . the patient had not traveled abroad in the past three months and lived with her husband and their 18-year-old son . her 43-year-old husband , a smoker without any systemic disease , worked in the hanyang district of wuhan city , china and returned to taiwan on january 12 , 2020 . thereafter , he developed rhinorrhea on january 21 , 2020 , and later visited the clinic . he denied any history of being involved with the huanan seafood wholesale market in wuhan . his chest x-ray showed no abnormal findings . after he was prescribed antihistamines , his rhinorrhea quickly improved after three days . \n\n laboratory data of the wife revealed mild lymphopenia ( 642/mul ; reference range , 650-4300/mul ) and an elevated level of alanine aminotransferase ( 38 units/l ; reference range , 7-35 units/l ) . rapid antigen tests for influenza a , b , and adenovirus from throat swabs of the patient were all negative . under the suspicion of a covid-19 infection from her husband , she was admitted to the airborne isolation unit . we notified the taiwan cdc immediately . according to the guidelines of the taiwan cdc , an oropharyngeal swab and a sputum specimen must be examined for a suspected covid-19 patient . however , an oropharyngeal swab and saliva specimens were obtained because she had no respiratory symptoms . the taiwan cdc laboratory confirmed that the wife 's oropharyngeal swab was positive for sars-cov-2 rna using a real-time-reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( rrt-pcr ) assay . we immediately performed an oropharyngeal swab test for the husband . his oropharyngeal swab also showed a positive result . he was also admitted to the isolation unit . \n\n during the wife 's hospitalization , she was prescribed diclofenac as she complained about having a severe headache . she suffered from a general skin rash and face swelling after taking the medicine . we discontinued all prescriptions and administered three doses of intravenous 4 mg dexamethasone , 12 h apart , for her suspected hypersensitivity to non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs . her rash and face swelling subsided soon . on the fifth day of observation , her fever and headache improved . during admission , her chest x-ray did not show any abnormal infiltrates . \n\n serial collections of oropharyngeal swab and saliva specimens were performed according to the guidelines of taiwan cdc . the aforementioned tests returned positive and then negative results on day 17 and 19 , respectively , since the onset of the illness ( fig . 1 ) . subsequently , her swab and saliva specimens showed positive results again . on days 28 , 30 , and 32 , since the onset of the disease , the swab and saliva specimens showed negative results on all the three days . the patient 's stool sample tested negative on day 9 . we decided to discontinue her isolation after discussing with the experts of the taiwan cdc on day 33 . \n\n during the husband 's hospitalization , his oropharyngeal swab and saliva both tested positive on day 15 since the onset of the illness . on the 17th , 19th , 21st days , his oropharyngeal swab and saliva specimens tested negative . his stool sample showed a positive result on the 17th day of the illness , but then a negative result on the 19th day . isolation for him was discontinued on the 22nd day of the illness . \n\n according to the previous reports , the presentations were variable for the covid-19 patients . patients may be asymptomatic or may present with a mild cough , a fever , respiratory failure , acute respiratory distress syndrome , or potentially fatal outcomes . the contagious period of sars-cov-2 infection is not known . consequently , it is debatable as to when covid-19 patients can be de-isolated . we hypothesized that transmission via respiratory droplets is possible when the viruses are detectable in the patients ' upper airways . the taiwan cdc guidelines recommend serial collections of upper airway specimens for detecting the virus . \n\n our observations showed that the wife had more severe symptoms , such as a fever and headache , than the husband , and she received corticosteroid therapy for her hypersensitivity . she had much longer and intermittent virus detections from her upper airway in comparison to her husband . the wife may have had a higher viral load than the husband since she showed severe symptoms . it might also be more difficult for her to achieve virus clearance from the upper airway . moreover , since she was on corticosteroid therapy , the influence on viral clearance is not known . however , this factor may prolong virus shedding according to other coronavirus observations . individual immune responses for virus clearance may also influence the results . \n\n furthermore , live viruses are related to true transmission . we do not know whether the positive results of rrt-pcr refer to a persistent infection or to the presence of residual sequences of viral rna , as we did not perform virus cultures . the taiwan cdc guidelines have been upgraded to mention that the patients who show three continuous negative results of rrt-pcr from oropharyngeal swabs and sputum ( or saliva ) specimens from the upper airways can be de-isolated . in this case , we de-isolated the patients on february 28 , 2020 , based on the three consecutively negative results , \n\n three additional issues have been raised in this report . firstly , we collected saliva specimens in addition to oropharyngeal swabs of our patients for sars-cov-2 testing . previous studies have mentioned that the sars-cov2 was also detected in the saliva of covid-19 patients and serial saliva viral load monitoring generally showed a declining trend . saliva is considered a promising non-invasive specimen for diagnosis and monitoring . secondly , the rrt-pcr results in oropharyngeal swab and saliva samples turned to positive from negative were observed in the wife . this might be due to the variations in quality for sample collection and the viral loads , especially when prior series of samples with high cycle threshold values were noted . thirdly , our patient was prescribed with diclofenac , a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( nsaid ) for headache relief . diclofenac and ibuprofen are commonly used nsaids for pain-relieving agents . a previous study shows that ibuprofen could increase the binding affinity between sars-cov2 and its target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) , which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung , intestine , kidney , and blood vessels , and increased the risk of developing severe illness of covid-19 . acetaminophen seems to be a better choice than ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatory drugs . however , these preliminary observation and speculations need further investigation in the future . \n\n in conclusion , the wife had a more severe course of the disease and was under corticosteroid treatment . the virus was detected for a longer period in the upper airway of the wife as compared to her husband . however , we still do not know the actual contagious period of sars-cov-2 infection . currently , the rrt-pcr results of serial specimens from the upper airways are the only way to decide whether covid-19 patients can be de-isolated . further studies on individual immune responses against the virus infection are required . methods to distinguish a persistent infection from residual viral rna sequences are also required . furthermore , epidemiological data of the contagion may need to be collected and analyzed to understand the actual contagious period of sars-cov-2 infection . \n\n references \n\n a novel

01100000	the contribution of diabetic micro-angiopathy to adverse outcomes in covid-19 \n\n increasing evidence points to endothelial cell dysfunction as a key pathophysiological factor in severe coronavirus disease-19 ( covid-19 ) , manifested by platelet aggregation , microthrombi and altered vasomotor tone . this may be driven by direct endothelial cell entry by the virus , or indirectly by activated inflammatory cascade . major risk groups identified for adverse outcomes in covid-19 are diabetes , and those from the black , asian and ethnic minority ( bame ) populations . hyperglycaemia ( expressed as glycated haemoglobin or mean hospital glucose ) correlates with worse outcomes in covid-19 . it is not known whether hyperglycaemia is causative or is a surrogate marker - persistent hyperglycaemia is well known as an aetiological agent in microangiopathy . in this article , we propose that pre-existing endothelial dysfunction of microangiopathy , more commonly evident in diabetes and bame groups , makes an individual vulnerable to the subsequent 'endothelitis ' of covid-19 infection . \n\n there is emerging understanding that coronavirus disease-19 ( covid-19 ) induced respiratory complications appear to have a distinct pattern that differs from typical adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) . it is characterised by a dissociation between relatively well-preserved lung mechanics and the severity of hypoxemia . a possible explanation for the severe hypoxemia occurring in compliant lungs , is the loss of lung perfusion regulation and hypoxic vasoconstriction . coagulation dysfunction also appears to be common in severe covid-19 , with fatal cases exhibiting diffuse microvascular thrombosis , suggesting a thrombogenic microangiopathy . \n\n it is becoming increasingly recognised , therefore , that endothelial damage and pulmonary microvascular thrombosis are central to the clinical severity of covid-19 . endothelial access by the virus is mediated via the protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) , which is highly expressed on vascular tissue . replication of virus within the host cell can cause direct cellular damage and release of pro-inflammatory signals . angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ( ace-2 ) consumption by viral entry would be predicted to increase local angiotensin-ii concentration , contributing to vasoconstriction , endothelial activation , and pro-inflammatory cytokine release - inducing further alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial cell damage . endothelial cell involvement may then spread across vascular beds of different organs . \n\n both diabetes and ethnicity appear to be additional risk factors emerging in clinical sequelae of the covid-19 pandemic . within the hospitalised covid-19 population , individuals with diabetes are over-represented . a systematic review reported a significant association between diabetes and covid-19 infection severity ( odds ratio 2.67 , 95 % ci 1.91-3.74 ) . subsequent data from china estimated mortality rates near 10 % in diabetes , from a sample of 72,314 confirmed cases . the most recent publication , comprising 7,336 patients , showed the risk of fatal outcome from covid-19 was up to 50 % higher in patients with diabetes . furthermore , well-controlled blood glucose was associated with lower hospital mortality than poorly controlled glucose ( hazard ratio 0.14 ) . \n\n diabetes is characterised , not only by hyperglycaemia , but also endothelial dysfunction and microcirculatory impairment . microvascular disease ( either retinopathy or nephropathy ) is present in over one-third of newly-diagnosed patients with type-2 diabetes ( t2d ) . the consequences of endothelial dysfunction include dysregulation of vasodilation , fibrinolysis , and anti-aggregation - classically leading to macrovascular disease - and may contribute to microvascular disease retinopathy , nephropathy and neuropathy . however , evidence of microvascular dysfunction in one organ is a marker of systemic injury . it is increasingly recognised that there are microvascular pulmonary complications of diabetes ( 'diabetic lung ' ) . it has been suggested that reduced pulmonary diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide ( dlco ) may be attributed to vascular injury of pulmonary capillaries related to diabetic microangiopathy . importantly , the functional impairment was directly related to the degree of glucose control ( glycated haemoglobin - hba1c ) and the presence of diabetic microvascular complications including retinopathy , neuropathy , and microalbuminuria in a sex-specific manner . the relationship of impaired gas exchange with diabetes was observed , even in those who had never smoked . in these individuals , the pulmonary microvasculature may be poorly prepared to meet the challenge of covid-19 infection . \n\n the black , asian and minority ethnic ( bame ) community have suffered disproportionally from covid-19 . bame , although only 13 % of the united kingdom population and a younger age distribution , accounts for one third of all covid-19 cases and 34 % of critically-ill covid-19 patients . the mechanisms underlying the disproportionate effect of covid-19 infection on bame patients remain incompletely understood . however , bame groups have a disproportionally high prevalence of t2d and disparities have been observed in diabetes control , monitoring and presence of microvascular complications in the bame , compared to white population . in this context , dysglycaemia ( both hba1c and mean glucose ) associating with adverse outcomes in covid-19 , may be surrogates for the presence and severity of underlying microvascular disease . the prevalence of prediabetes among adults is approximately 38 % and 35 % , in the united states and united kingdom respectively . prediabetes is also over-represented in bame population . in the uk , the hazard ratio for prediabetes in south asians was 1.67 ( 1.12 to 2.50 ) and for blacks 1.45 ( 0.92 to 2.27 ) , compared to the white population . although it is alluring to think that people with prediabetes are protected from microvascular disease ; early stages of retinopathy , nephropathy , and neuropathy have been reported in people with prediabetes , with a prevalence of up to 10 % . \n\n microvascular disease and endothelial dysfunction may underlie adverse outcomes in covid-19 and may represent the pathophysiological key missing link that identifies susceptible populations and may require specific treatment . analyses of data on patients with covid-19 should include details of diabetes complications and age , to untangle the complex interaction between ethnicity , diabetes and covid-19 outcomes

11000000	clinical characteristics of 145 patients with corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in taizhou , zhejiang , china . \n\n objective : the aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of corona virus disease 2019 in taizhou , china . methods : a single center retrospective observational study was performed between jan 1 , 2020 and mar 11 , 2020 at taizhou public health medical center , zhejiang , china . all patients with confirmed corona virus disease 2019 were enrolled , and their clinical data were gathered by reviewing electronic medical records . outcomes of severely ill patients and non-severely ill patients were compared . results : of 145 hospitalized patients with covid-19 , the average age was 47.5 years old ( standard deviation , 14.6 ) and 54.5 % were men . hypertension was the most common comorbidity ( 15.2 % ) , followed by diabetes mellitus ( 9.7 % ) . common symptoms included dry cough ( 81.4 % ) , fever ( 75.2 % ) , anorexia ( 42.8 % ) , fatigue ( 40.7 % ) , chest tightness ( 32.4 % ) , diarrhea ( 26.9 % ) and dizziness ( 20 % ) . according to imaging examination , 79.3 % patients showed bilateral pneumonia , 18.6 % showed unilateral pneumonia , 61.4 % showed ground-glass opacity , and 2.1 % showed no abnormal result . compared with non-severely ill patients , severely ill patients were older ( mean , years , 52.8 vs. 45.3 , p < 0.01 ) , had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus ( 16.3 % vs. 6.9 % , p = 0.08 ) , had a higher body mass index ( mean , 24.78 vs. 23.20 , p = 0.02 ) and were more likely to have fever ( 90.7 % vs. 68.6 % , p = 0.01 ) , anorexia ( 60.5 % vs. 35.3 % , p = 0.01 ) , chest tightness ( 60.5 % vs.20.6 % , p < 0.01 ) and dyspnea ( 7.0 % vs. 0 % , p = 0.03 ) . of the 43 severely ill patients , 6 ( 14 % ) received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy , and 1 ( 2.3 % ) received invasive mechanical ventilation . conclusions : older patients or patients with comorbidities such as obesity or diabetes mellitus were more likely to have severe condition . treatments of covid-19 is still experimental and more clinical trials are needed . 
00001000	the possible impact of covid-19 on colorectal surgery in italy . \n\n the covid-19 outbreak in italy is stopping access to elective benign disease treatment and changing the approach to malignant disease as well as the outpatients care of those patients treated for colorectal cancer . the lack of knowledge about the possible implications of the spread of the infection during surgery could extend to infect surgeons , surgery nurses and also the anesthesiologists , the results will become evident in the long term . the surgical approach may change going towards less invasive procedures to minimize the aerosolized biological fluids , this approach could reduce the access to first level hospitals changing the entire health care system in the future . 
00001000	optimizing the trauma resuscitation bay during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n the covid-19 global pandemic due to the sars-cov2 ( cov2 ) virus has created the need to adapt hospital workspaces and staffing models , and trauma is no exception . while the optimal configuration of a trauma resuscitation area is debatable , the space needs to be large enough to accommodate the trauma team and ancillary staff . it also needs to have ready access to supplies and equipment to quickly and easily control hemorrhage , secure an airway and initiate fluid resuscitation . lastly , stores of personal protective equipment in the form of fluid resistant gowns , head covering , face shield , and gloves ( both sterile and non-sterile ) should be readily available but under strict access . as cov2 carriers increased in our population in new jersey , we treated each incoming trauma patient as a potentially cov2-positive case and sought to reconfigure out trauma resuscitation area to minimize exposure of our supplies to aerosolized virus . 
00001000	youtube as a source of medical information on the novel coronavirus 2019 disease ( covid-19 ) pandemic . \n\n media coverage on coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) has been extensive , yet large gaps remain in our understanding of the role of social media platforms during worldwide health crisis . the purpose of this study was to assess the most viewed youtube videos on covid-19 for medical content . we coded video characteristics , source , and medical content of the 113 most-widely viewed videos about covid-19 . seventy-nine ( 69.9 % ) videos were classified as useful , and 10 ( 8.8 % ) videos were classified as misleading . independent users were more likely to post misleading videos than useful videos ( 60.0 % vs 21.5 % , p = 0.009 ) . news agencies were more likely to post useful videos than misleading videos ( 72.2 % vs 40.0 % , p = 0.039 ) . useful videos were more likely to present any information on prevalence or incidence ( 79.7 % vs 20.0 % , p < 0.001 ) , as well as information on outcomes or prognosis ( 84.8 % vs 30.0 % , p < 0.001 ) compared to misleading videos . the world health organization contributed one useful video ( 1.3 % ) , while no videos from the center for disease control were included . although youtube generally is a useful source of medical information on the covid-19 pandemic , increased efforts to disseminate accurate information from reputable sources is desired to help mitigate disease spread and decrease unnecessary panic in the general population . 
00001010	estimating the infection fatality rate among symptomatic covid-19 cases in the united states . \n\n knowing the infection fatality rate ( ifr ) of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infections is essential for the fight against the covid-19 pandemic . using data through april 20 , 2020 , we fit a statistical model to covid-19 case fatality rates over time at the us county level to estimate the covid-19 ifr among symptomatic cases ( ifr-s ) as time goes to infinity . the ifr-s in the us was estimated to be 1.3 % ( 95 % central credible interval : 0.6 % to 2.1 % ) . county-specific rates varied from 0.5 % to 3.6 % . the overall ifr for covid-19 should be lower when we account for cases that remain and recover without symptoms . when used with other estimating approaches , our model and our estimates can help disease and policy modelers to obtain more accurate predictions for the epidemiology of the disease and the impact of alternative policy levers to contain this pandemic . the model could also be used with future epidemics to get an early sense of the magnitude of symptomatic infection at the population-level before more direct estimates are available . substantial variation across patient demographics likely exists and should be the focus of future studies . [ editor 's note : this fast track ahead of print article is the accepted version of the peer-reviewed manuscript . the final edited version will appear in an upcoming issue of health affairs . ] . 
10000000	comparison of chest ct findings between covid-19 pneumonia and other types of viral pneumonia : a two-center retrospective study . \n\n objectives : to compare the pulmonary chest ct findings of patients with covid-19 pneumonia with those with other types of viral pneumonia . methods : this retrospective review includes 154 patients with rt-pcr-confirmed covid-19 pneumonia diagnosed between february 11 and 20 , 2020 , and 100 patients with other types of viral pneumonia diagnosed between april 2011 and december 2020 from two hospitals . high-resolution ct ( hrct ) of the chest was performed . data on location , distribution , attenuation , maximum lesion range , lobe involvement , number of lesions , air bronchogram signs , hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement , and pleural effusion were collected . associations between imaging characteristics and covid-19 pneumonia were analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression models . results : a peripheral distribution was associated with a 13.04-fold risk of covid-19 pneumonia , compared with a diffuse distribution . a maximum lesion range > 10 cm was associated with a 9.75-fold risk of covid-19 pneumonia , compared with a maximum lesion range < = 5 cm , and the involvement of 5 lobes was associated with an 8.45-fold risk of covid-19 pneumonia , compared with a maximum lesion range < = 2 . no pleural effusion was associated with a 3.58-fold risk of covid-19 pneumonia compared with the presence of pleural effusion . hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement was associated with a 2.79-fold risk of covid-19 pneumonia . conclusion : a peripheral distribution , a lesion range > 10 cm , involvement of 5 lobes , presence of hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement , and no pleural effusion were significantly associated with 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia . key points : a peripheral distribution , a lesion range > 10 cm , involvement of 5 lobes , presence of hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement , and no pleural effusion were significantly associated with covid-19 compared with other types of viral pneumonia . 
00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region , presented to the emergency with a 3-day history of headaches , dizziness , intermittent nausea , and vomiting . brain mr showed a tumor that was entirely confined within the third ventricle , causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the child has an uncomplicated recovery after surgery , and covid-19 was eventually ruled out after a 14-day quarantine . \n\n finally , we have some additional tips for conducting surgery under level 3 precautions . a comfortable goggle and use of antifogging agent are very helpful . in addition , surgeons should avoid unnecessary conversation and perform the surgery as gently as possible to prevent splashing blood in a negative pressure operating room . \n\n neuro-oncology patients may become infected with covid-19 , and thus surgery for these patients can not be avoided . as neurosurgeons , it is crucial that we do our utmost to care for our patients while ensuring our own safety at the same time . in these challenging times , we have faith that through our concerted efforts , this pandemic will be overcome soon . \n\n publisher 's note \n\n springer nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations . \n\n compliance with ethical

precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu

after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the

00001000	emergency trauma care during the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in china \n\n background \n\n a novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in wuhan , hubei province , in december 2019 ; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans . china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease . however , a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking . to regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak , we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in wuhan . \n\n main body \n\n the article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 , indications for emergency surgery , and infection prevention and control for medical personnel , providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period . \n\n conclusions \n\n the measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of covid-19 . \n\n background \n\n a novel corona virus disease ( covid-19 ) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) began in wuhan , hubei province , china , in december 2019 . by february 13 , 2020 , more than 60,000 cases were confirmed , nearly 50,000 in hubei alone , and the source of the infection was yet to be definitely determined . the world health organization ( who ) has declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) . considering the current rate of human to human transmission , most countries in the world should be well prepared for the potential global covid-19 pandemic . china is on the frontline in the fight against the virus , and medical staff have become exhausted due to the excessive workload brought on by the outbreak . medical testing tools and personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , such as face shields , goggles , and gloves , have become scarce and have had to be rationed among teams and medical centers , with severe shortage in hubei , the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak . a report from a neurosurgery department of a teaching hospital in wuhan showed that from december 25 , 2019 , to february 6 , 2020 , eight covid-19 suspected patients were admitted , and three were confirmed . consequently , 12 medical personnel were infected ( 11 nurses and one doctor ) , among whom three had been in close contact with the first confirmed case . according to the data released by the national health commission ( nhc ) of the people 's republic of china , a total of 1716 medical personnel infections had been reported nationwide , accounting for 3.8 % of the total confirmed cases by 24:00 on february 11 , 2020 , of which six ( 0.4 % ) had died . of these , hubei province reported 1502 cases , accounting for 87.5 % of the total medical personnel infections , while wuhan city reported 1102 cases , accounting for 73.4 % . notably , medical personnel are the most valuable resource during the outbreak . how to protect them from infection is one of the foremost challenges in the fight against sars-cov-2 . \n\n although china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of sars-cov-2 , severe trauma can still occur . during the outbreak , the population of trauma patients may be diverse in terms of infection status , including patients who were previously healthy , suspected to be infected , confirmed infected , close contacts of infected individuals , and asymptomatic carriers . thus , balancing optimal trauma care while preventing further spread of the viral infection during the outbreak is a major challenge . \n\n to our knowledge , there is no relevant consensus or clinical guideline available on the indications of , timing of or perioperative protection during emergency surgery for trauma . to protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of trauma care , we have summarized the recommended perioperative infection prevention and control measures for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 based on current practical experience in china and the published literature on surgical practice during the past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) , ebola virus , and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n main text \n\n general principles \n\n special requirements for the hospitals receiving trauma patients during the outbreak \n\n emergency department : set up a triage area for assessment of all patients at admission , allowing early recognition of possible sars-cov-2 infection and immediate isolation of patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection in an area separate from other patients . \n\n radiology department : a dedicated ct room should be kept on standby for the examination of infected patients . \n\n operating room ( or ) : a relatively isolated negative-pressure or is preferable ; if there is no permanent negative-pressure or , a temporarily modified negative-pressure or the main operating suite of the hospital can be converted . \n\n intensive care unit ( icu ) : an isolated area should be prepared in the icu , and suspected patients should be treated in a single space . \n\n intrahospital transport : although an ideal trauma center with a door-to-door ct room and negative-pressure or are preferable in this situation , most regions in china do not operate such facilities . therefore , a predetermined transport route should be used to minimize exposure , and any intrahospital transport should utilize dedicated carts demarcated by a warning logo equipped with protective supplies and hand disinfectants . the patient should wear a medical mask , and the walls and the floor of the passageways and the elevator should be covered with a plastic lining . \n\n to control the spread of covid-19 , basic principles for treating infectious diseases should be followed , and necessary measures should be taken before receiving trauma patients . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n precaution level applicable personnel and scenarios personal protective equipment level 1 triage , emergency department clean non-sterile long gown , disposable head cover , disposable medical mask , and gloves . level 2 close contact with suspected patients , or handling secretions , feces , and personal items belonging to patients ; performing ct scan ( fig . 1 ) disposable head cover , gloves , disposable coverall , n95 respirator or equivalent , goggle or face shield , rubber boots or fluid-resistant overshoes , etc . level 3 close contact with suspected patients , or collecting blood , respiratory tract samples of patients , especially for endotracheal intubation , airway care , and sputum suction , as well as emergency surgery ( fig . 2 ) . on the basis of wearing secondary protective equipment such as goggle or face shield , other protective equipment should be strengthened . for instance , adding disposable surgical clothing and gloves in addition to disposable coverall and gloves . two layers of gloves covering protective clothing and surgical clothes sleeves , respectively , use of a powered air purifying respirator ( papr ) . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n to standardize and simplify the precaution measures and equipment required for different personnel and scenarios in trauma care , we adopted a three-level precaution protocol in trauma care ( table 1 ) . \n\n all levels of precaution were based on implementing standard precautions , including hand hygiene , respiratory hygiene , and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment ( ppe ) according to different risk levels . proper training of the standard donning and doffing procedures is the basis of effective protection . in epidemic areas such as hubei province , all patients can be regarded as potentially suspected patients during the outbreak , and the level of the precaution should be elevated . \n\n triage \n\n classification of the patients suspected cases clinical confirmed cases ( hubei only ) pathogenic confirmed cases diagnostic basis outside hubei province : two of the clinical manifestations with at least one of the epidemiological histories , three of the clinical manifestations without epidemiological history suspected patient in hubei province with ct findings of pneumonia suspected or clinically confirmed patients with at least one pathogenic evidence epidemiological investigation 1 . travel to or residence in wuhan in the 14 days prior to symptom onset ; 2 . close contactb with sars-cov-2 infection ( rrt-pcr positive ) within 14 days before onset ; 3 . exposed to patients from wuhan and surrounding areas , or from a community with patients who reported fever or respiratory symptoms14 d before onset ; 4 . clustering outbreak . - - clinical manifestations and ct scan 1 . fever and/or respiratory symptoms ; 2 . imaging characteristics of covid-19 ( ct : multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes in early stage , which are obvious in the peripheral lung , and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs , and lung consolidation may occur in severe cases ) ; 3 . the total number of white blood cells in the early stage is normal or decreased , and the lymphocyte count is decreased - - pathogenic evidence null null 1 . detection of sars-cov-2 in respiratory specimens and sera by rrt-pcr assays ; 2 . by virus dna sequencing , respiratory or blood samples dna sequence highly homologous with sars-cov-2 . \n\n diagnostic criteria of covid-19a \n\n covid-19 coronavirus induced disease , sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 , rrt-pcr real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \n\n athe diagnostic criteria were defined according to guidance for the diagnosis and management for covid-19 ( 5th edition ) released by national health commission of people 's republic of china in feb. 4 , 2020 \n\n bclose contact is defined as follows : \n\n - healthcare-associated exposure , including providing direct care for covid-19 patients , working with healthcare workers infected with novel coronavirus , visiting patients , or staying in the same close environment as a covid-19 patient \n\n - working together in close proximity or sharing the same classroom environment with a covid-19 patient \n\n - traveling together with a covid-19 patient in any kind of conveyance \n\n - living in the same household as a covid-19 patient \n\n trauma patients during the outbreak should be managed using the relevant contents in table 2 , and they should complete a brief epidemiological investigation at the triage stage . however , the trauma patients ' history may be unreliable , as they may not have time to be detailed . more emphasis should be placed on the objective data . during the outbreak in wuhan , a total of 32 emergency operations were performed in a tertiary care hospital , including 19 suspected and seven pathogenic confirmed cases . in addition , nine covid-19 patients in another tertiary care hospital underwent gastrointestinal surgery , but in all of these patients , covid-19 was diagnosed postoperatively . it is worth noting that there have been many cases of asymptomatic patients with an incubation period . the maximum incubation period was reported to be 24 days . \n\n evaluation \n\n trauma care is highly time dependent and requires rapid and effective evaluation and management . during the outbreak , primary and secondary surveys should be completed while maintaining the premise of effective protection . \n\n general principles of evaluation \n\n dynamic evaluation strategies should be conducted throughout the trauma care process . the personal protective equipment ( ppe ) worn by medical personnel may result in limited or incomplete physical examinations ( such as palpation and auscultation ) . therefore , injury assessment may rely on radiological examinations . \n\n radiology evaluation \n\n a chest ct scan is recommended for all severe trauma patients if there is no contraindication . if the chest ct scan is not possible due to critical condition , the patient should be treated as a suspect for infection until infection is excluded . \n\n level 3 ppe during ct examination \n\n if the hospital has a trauma resuscitation unit , complete x-ray including but not limited to the chest and focused assessment with sonography for trauma ( fast ) in the trauma resuscitation unit should be performed . for hemodynamic stabilization , a ct scan including but not limited to the chest should be performed ( fig . 1 ) . if the hospital does not have a trauma resuscitation unit , patients with hemodynamic instability should be resuscitated in the emergency department and undergo fast simultaneously . once the hemodynamic status is stable enough , the ct scan should be performed as soon as possible . \n\n ct scan protocol for trauma patients suspected of having covid-19 : medical personnel should first determine the method and scope of the scan , including but not limited to the chest , according to the mechanism of injury . for stab wounds , the segment and body cavity near the wound should be examined . for gunshot wounds , due to the high kinetic energy of the projectiles , the tortuous wound path , and the heavy tissue damage , the scanning range should be expanded appropriately . patients who have sustained blunt injuries with high energy , such as traffic injuries , should usually be scanned with enhanced scanning ranging from head to mid-thigh ( including the whole lower limb when there is lower limb injury ) . enhanced scanning is helpful in providing further information on organ injury , and three-dimensional reconstruction of blood vessels and bone should be performed when major vascular and bone injury is suspected . \n\n ct features of covid-19 : it should be noted that the pulmonary imaging changes of covid-19 vary depending on the patient 's age , immunity status , stage of disease at the time of the scan , underlying disease , and drug intervention . reports have shown that in the early stage of infection , ct shows multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes , which are obvious in the peripheral lung and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs . in severe cases , lung consolidation could occur . in addition , special attention should be paid to discerning between covid-19 infection and pulmonary contusion . \n\n blood and pathogen specimen collection \n\n if possible , nasopharyngeal swabs , sputum , lower respiratory tract secretions , and blood samples should be collected and sent for rrt-pcr in the emergency period . if no respiratory tract specimens are collected before the operation due to time constraints , they can be collected during or after the operation . \n\n all specimens shall be deemed to be potentially infectious . collection , transportation , and processing of any clinical specimens should be performed by biological safety training qualified medical staff . level 3 precautions should be adopted to minimize the possibility of exposure . \n\n the results of rrt-pcr may be falsely negative due to the influence of sampling , transportation , extraction , and testing . recent observations have shown that 30 to 40 % of patients with covid-19 ct features were rrt-pcr negative . as a result , the protection standard can not be lowered due to negative results . since the rrt-pcr test can take several hours to confirm the diagnosis , chest ct is recommended as the basis for the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 in suspected patients , especially in areas with a high incidence of the disease . the use of chest ct not only helps to control the spread of the epidemic but can also ensure definitive care for trauma injuries in a timely manner . \n\n emergency surgery \n\n emergency surgery is of great importance for severe trauma patients , the aim of which includes hemorrhage control , contamination abatement , and compartment pressure relief as soon as possible . effective prevention of sars-cov-2 transmission by standard intraoperative protective measures is an important indicator of a successful operation . from the available evidence , sars-cov-2 is spread mainly through respiratory droplets and contact , while aerosol and fecal-oral transmission are still under investigation . from the existing evidence and our practical experience , all medical staff should adopt level 3 precautions when entering the or . \n\n or preparation \n\n an independent negative pressure operation room is the first choice . operations can only be performed when the pressure is between - 10 and - 5 pa . if a negative pressure or is not available , a relatively isolated or with an independent purification system is an alternative option . nevertheless , the purification system should be shut down during the operation , and a final disinfection should be performed postoperatively . as in standard trauma protocols , the more critical patient should be operated on first . if two or more suspected or confirmed infected patients arrive in the or , a 30-min disinfection is warranted before the subsequent operation . the dedicated or should be clearly marked as covid-19 exclusive . \n\n the dedicated covid-19 or should be designed with a special passage and elevator . the design should focus on shortening the outdoor distance , reducing the chance of human contact , and limiting the time spent in suspected contaminated areas . materials and equipment should only be delivered by specially assigned staff . people inside the or are not allowed to leave during the operation , and outdoor personnel should not enter without permission . surgical articles should be clearly identified , and the use of disposable items is recommended . to maintain pressure , surgical supplies ( surgical instruments , dressings , single-use consumables , high-value consumables , medications , and relevant items ) should be well prepared in advance . only unidirectional flow is permitted ( nothing should be taken out once it is entered during the operation ) . personnel movement and the frequency of door opening are strictly limited . nondisposable items should be disposed of postoperatively in strict accordance with regulations . two suction apparatuses are optimal , one of which is for exclusive use by the anesthesiologist . the negative pressure aspirator should be immediately placed on the patient 's face to minimize the spread of respiratory secretions after entering the operation room . \n\n ppe for operation personnel \n\n protective clothing for surgical personnel : a after wearing protective clothing and inner gloves , b after wearing operating clothes and outer gloves \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe donning \n\n the topic of intraoperative protection remains controversial because most surgeons have no experience performing surgery while wearing heavy and airproof contagion gowns and goggles . according to practice in china , some medical personnel wore two surgical gowns , two contagion gowns and four pairs of gloves for surgery during the covid-19 epidemic . instead of enhancing protective effects , such excessive protection can reduce the visual , auditory , and tactile sensitivity of the surgeon , thus reducing the precision of surgical operations ( fig . 2 ) . the influence of excessive protection on the surgeon mainly includes ( 1 ) difficulty breathing , ( 2 ) fog on goggles and face shields that interfere with vision , ( 3 ) constriction of visual fields , ( 4 ) loss of flexibility due to multiple layers of gloves , and ( 5 ) double or triple the duration of the operation . a practical lesson had been learned from the case of a 7-year-old girl with suspected covid-19 infection who was subjected to an urgent craniotomy due to obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a third ventricle germ cell-derived tumor . the surgical team adopted a level 3 precaution including n95 respirators or papr , and full coverage with protective gowns ( shoe covers included ) and sterile surgical gowns . consequently , an operation that would have taken 2-3 h ended up taking 10 h. possible solutions for reducing the impact of ppe on surgery include reducing the or temperature ( minimizing the formation of moisture on goggles ) and enhancing the lighting in the room to obtain better vision . all ppes are fit for single use except papr . the steps of donning and doffing should be completed under professional supervision ( fig . 3 ) . \n\n anesthesia \n\n regional nerve block is the first choice for limb surgeries . general anesthesia is recommended for neurosurgery , torso trauma , or multiple trauma with shock . \n\n attention should be paid to avoid aerosol generation caused by coughing and other causes in airway operations . intubation should be performed after rapid induction and full muscle relaxation to ensure complete disappearance of spontaneous breathing , and sputum aspiration before intubation should be avoided . remote endotracheal intubation by disposable glide scope with an assistant is recommended . awake endotracheal intubation is not recommended for patients with a difficult airway , hypoxia , or unconsciousness . if face mask or laryngeal mask ventilation is able to maintain oxygenation , multiple tools ( fiberoptic bronchoscope , glide scope , light stick , laryngeal mask ) can be used to assist endotracheal intubation after rapid induction of general anesthesia . if not , cricothyroid laryngotomy should be performed without any hesitation . rapid induction via oral intubation is recommended in cases of a possibly full stomach . mask positive pressure ventilation after administration should be avoided . no emetic measure is recommended . extra caution should be taken on when a nasogastric tube is in place . covid-19 can cause pulmonary inflammation that can induce added lung injury , restricted crystal fluid , and protective ventilation . the proper mechanical ventilation parameters include limited tidal volume ( < 8 ml/kg ) and airway pressure ( platform pressure < 30 cm h2o ) ; 5-10 cm h2o positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation ( peep ) is optional for alveoli expansion and oxygenation maintenance . permissive hypercapnia is also acceptable . \n\n surgical strategy \n\n the concept of damage control surgery should be followed to simplify the operation . it is optimal to finish an operation within 90 min , and strategies such as packing hemostasis , external fixation , and temporary abdominal closure are helpful to shorten the operation time . surgical personnel should be highly focused and closely coordinated . gentle movement is essential to avoid accidental injury and contamination caused by the spattering of blood , fluid , and bone debris . limiting rinsing and drainage of bodily fluids is another key to effectively reducing intraoperative contamination . reliable hemostasis should be maintained to prevent bleeding around the incision . excessive negative pressure suction and violent operations are prohibited . it is also suggested that electrotome use is not suitable under this scenario ; if it must be used , the power should be minimized . smoke should be quickly suctioned to avoid aerosol generation . \n\n postoperative management \n\n postoperative management of patients \n\n after the operation , the patient should be transferred to an isolation ward in the icu . the endotracheal tubes should be removed under analgesia to avoid violent coughing while the patient is stable . sputum aspiration should be performed by a closed suction system . trauma and surgery can impair the patient 's immune function . clinically , some asymptomatic covid-19 patients suffered rapid deterioration after surgery . surgeons and anesthesiologists should be aware that acute lung injury caused by covid-19 may exist preoperatively or worsen postoperatively . therefore , special attention should be paid to the monitoring of body temperature , infection , and hemodynamic index . reexamination of chest ct and rrt-pcr tests is also important . for postoperative trauma patients with fever , traumatic , or operative complications should also be considered to differentiate them from covid-19 . attention should be paid to symptomatic and etiological treatment . postoperative dyspnea and hypoxia should also be differentiated from complications such as pulmonary embolism . nutritional support and prevention of other complications ( bacterial infection , stress ulcer , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , and deep venous thrombosis ) should also be strengthened . \n\n quarantine \n\n based on current experience , if the medical personnel complete the operation successfully and comply with all the regulations without any accidental exposure , the patient does not need to be quarantined . otherwise , a 14-day medical observation is obligatory , and timely treatment is needed when any abnormalities occur . notably , some literature recommends a routine 14-day quarantine for relevant personnel involved in the operation for sars-cov-2 confirmed patients . however , extreme safety often results in severe incapacity to help patients , so a balance between safety and efficiency must be maintained . \n\n discussion \n\n the national health commission of china initially decided to temporarily call the disease novel coronavirus pneumonia or ncp . it was not until february 12 , 2020 , that the official name covid-19 was announced by the who . shortly after the who announced the disease 's official name , the virus causing it was named sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , highlighting the new virus 's similarity to the sars virus identified in 2003 . based on epidemiological data up to jan. 4 , 2020 , the estimated r0 was 2.2 ( 95 % ci , 1.4 to 3.9 ) , while the latest study surveying cases up to feb. 14 , 2020 , further calculated that the r0 of covid-19 was 3.77 . therefore , researchers estimated that in terms of infection ability , sars-cov-2 was slightly higher than the sars virus and significantly higher than the mers-cov . according to clinical characteristic analysis of sars-cov-2 infection in china , the mortality was 2.01 % out of 28,018 cases as of feb. 6 , 2020 . by human-to-human transmission , sars-cov-2 had spread rapidly from wuhan , china , to 24 other countries as of feb. 12 , 2020 . the number of cases within china and other countries is rapidly increasing , and it is estimated that for every additional 10 % decrease in transmission rate , the peak population will be reduced by 20-47 % . the cumulative number of infected cases and deaths will be reduced by 23-49 % due to comprehensive interventions . if current interventions continue , it is expected that the number of people infected will peak in early march 2020 . based on the epidemiological analysis , only 1.18 % of the patients had direct contact with wild animals , 31.30 % of the patients had been in wuhan , and 71.80 % of the patients had contact with people from wuhan . common symptoms included fever , cough , and diarrhea . a total of 76.4 % of patients had radiologic findings manifested as pneumonia , with the remaining patients exhibiting normal radiologic findings . poor clinical outcomes can be predicted by disease severity , including oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count , and chest ct manifestations . \n\n the transmission by aerosols is still under investigation . aerosols are solid , liquid , solid , and liquid granular substances suspended in the air , such as dust , smoke , fog , and microorganisms . these may be the `` flying vehicles '' for covid-19 . covid-19 aerosols are related to the increased risk of covid-19 transmission . tracheal intubation , noninvasive ventilation , tracheotomy , manual ventilation before intubation , bronchoscopy , cardiopulmonary resuscitation , sputum suction , and other airway operations , as well as the use of electrotome , suction , and drainage , all inevitably produce a large number of aerosols . when carrying out these operations , the protection and training of medical personnel should be strengthened , and preventive measures to protect against aerosols are recommended , including n95 respirators , papr , goggles or face shields , disposable fluid-resistant gowns , and limiting the number of people in the room . \n\n based on experience from the hospital in wuhan , patients with covid-19 have high mortality after surgery . as of february 14 , 2020 , 6 gastrointestinal operations were performed in the general surgery department of the authors ' hospital ; one 60-year-old male died of respiratory failure 14 days after surgery , and one died of septic shock , for a mortality rate of 33.33 % . another group of eight covid-19 confirmed patients in zhongnan hospital of wuhan university underwent gastrointestinal surgeries ( seven gastrointestinal tumors and one benign case ) ; one patient died of covid-19 after left hemicolectomy with the diagnosis of postoperative recurrence of renal cancer involving the descending colon with intestinal obstruction , and one tumor patient died from postoperative complications of abdominal infection , for a mortality rate of 25 % . trauma patients usually have massive hemorrhage , shock , and contamination . damage control strategies should be complied with to correct fatal triads caused by hypothermia , acidosis , and coagulopathy . meanwhile , effective oxygen therapy and organ function support are also indispensable . \n\n moreover , additional attention should be paid to patients in critical condition and to those who develop severe pneumonia after trauma . among covid-19 patients , critical patients , including patients with respiratory failure , septic shock , and other organ failures , have accounted for 29 % ~32 % . identifying high-risk groups with severe illness can also help reduce the occurrence of poor prognosis . the possible high-risk groups include patients over 65 years old , patients with obesity , and patients with other diseases ( such as chronic pulmonary disease , hypertension , heart disease , kidney disease , diabetes , tumor , and immune deficiency ) . \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe doffing \n\n the covid-19 outbreak poses significant challenges to hospital staff and specifically trauma surgeons , which must offer optimal and timely care despite the circumstances . strict safety protocols must be adhered to when carrying out emergency care for patients with severe trauma and other surgical diseases , which means that all the measures shall be carried out to preserve the ability of the medical staff to achieve the purpose of effective care without sacrificing the safety of all involved . the perspectives in this paper can not be a substitute for clinical judgment and expert consultation but can help provide up-to-date guidance on the clinical management of emergency surgery for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 ( fig . 4 ) . \n\n conclusion \n\n in conclusion , the covid-19 outbreak raises several issues concerning the safety of medical personnel and patients . areas with high incidence rates of covid-19 should conduct operations with caution and protection should be strengthened while ensuring suitable facilities to carry out optimal care with maximal safety . with the accumulation of clinical experience and in-depth research , some of the practices may require modification when additional high-quality evidence emerges . the above is china 's experience in treating trauma patients during the covid-19 outbreak . we hope that this report will help hospitals worldwide prepare for future covid-19 outbreaks and infection control in unexpected conditions . \n\n abbreviations \n\n covid-19 \n\n corona virus disease \n\n sars-cov-2 \n\n severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \n\n

00001000	applications of 3d printing technology to address covid-19 related supply shortages \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) was first identified in an outbreak in wuhan , china on december 8 , 2019 . globally , the number of affected covid-19 patients is growing exponentially , with the death toll exceeding 27,300 as of march 27 , 2020 . worldwide , there is a limited supply of n95 respirator masks , face shields , ventilator valves , testing kits and other personal protective equipment . thus , adequate production and distribution of personal protective equipment is critical during this pandemic . to address these shortages , three-dimensional ( 3d ) printing , a novel and innovative technology used to fabricate complex architectures , is well suited . 3d printing is an adjustable , robotic platform allowing for tailored deposition of biomaterials using computer-aided design systems to formulate layer-by-layer custom designs with controlled architecture and composition . \n\n masks \n\n n95 respirators masks have two advantages over surgical , paper or cloth masks : 1 ) they are > 95 % efficient at filtering 0.3-microm airborne particles and 2 ) they are fit tested to each user to ensure an adequate seal , such that air and small droplets do not enter around the edges of the mask and into the health care worker 's breathing zone . the centers for disease control and prevention recommends n95 masks for health care workers taking care of patients with covid-19 . \n\n 3d printing can be used to produce tailored seal designs for improving mask comfort and fit . to customize face mask seals , 3d laser scanning can be implemented to scan exact facial parameters , with a tailored and customized face seal n95 template . anthropometric data of the chin arc , jawline , face and nose lengths , and nose protrusion measurements can be taken into account with this customized seal . in a study using face seal prototypes with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic using a fused deposition modeling 3d printer , three subjects showed improved contact pressure compared with use of 3m 8210 n95 ffr respirator masks . moreover , a personalized mask may account for facial hair length and density for a more precise fit . \n\n displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . the biomaterials displayed in this image have been fully characterized in the medical literature , with the same material composition of n95 masks . the mask includes several layers thereby ensure effective filtration of viral particles . \n\n figure 1 \n\n standard n95 masks consist of filtration material composed of electrostatic non-woven polypropylene ( pp ) fibers which are semi-rigid , lightweight and fatigue resistant . the semi-crystalline structure may cause significant distortion of the 3d printed parts upon cooling thereby making 3d printing difficult . material extrusion 3d printing was used to design a 3d printable thermoplastic elastomeric material from a blend of polypropylene ( pp ) and styrene- ( ethylene-butylene ) -styrene ( sebs ) . this blend provides better printability and flexibility for n95 mask design . pp is commonly used for various industrial applications due to its low cost , processability , printability , recyclability and mechanical integrity . sebs is a polymeric elastomer with low processing temperature and low distortion during extrusion . thus , the pp/sebs combination would improve the processability of 3d printed n95 masks . moreover , controlling the thermoplastic elastomer ratio allows for tailoring the flexibility and elasticity of the 3d model material for better fitted masks . 3d melt electrospinning printing can also be used to create pp microfibers with sequential layering to accurately obtain a 3d form . thus , 3d printing procedures may allow for the creation of stable and biocompatible n95 masks that are comparable to industrial manufacturing brands . figure 1 displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . \n\n face shields \n\n polycarbonate and polyester , polyvinyl chloride and other synthetic polymers are commonly used to make surgical face shields . these biomaterials are transparent , lightweight and provide high optical clarity . the polymers can easily be printed using 3d technology to meet the needs of healthcare workers treating covid-19 . \n\n covid-19 specimen collection kit \n\n creating 3d printed test swabs would help increase covid-19 testing capacity . nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs can be made from a flexible polymer , using polystyrene for the shaft . the tip can be tailored to be micro fine using computer-aided design software . thereafter , swab bud lattice fibers can be made from calcium alginate using hydrogels using 3d tissue engineering . \n\n ventilator valves \n\n ventilator valves are attachments used to deliver oxygen at fixed concentrations for patients with acute respiratory distress , including covid-19 patients . 3d printing technology can be used via a filament extrusion system or a polymer-laser powder bed fusion process to print single-use valve sets . 3d printers can design the different elements of the valve using biomaterials such as polyamide and polysulfone , polycarbonate , silicone rubber and stainless steel . furthermore , these disposable valves eliminate time-consuming sterilization . \n\n medications \n\n 3d printing techniques , such as fused filament , inkjet , extrusion and powder extrusion , allow for fabrication of 3d printed pills . medication-printing technologies typically utilize a small nozzle to lay thin disc-shaped layers of powders and deposit microscopic droplets of liquid to bind the materials . a coaxial needle extrusion 3d technology was used to print active pharmaceutical ingredients and create combinations of controlled dosing of drugs . while there are no specific antivirals or vaccines for treatment of covid-19 , several well-characterized anti-viral drugs are being considered as therapies . it may be possible to use 3d medication-printing technology to effectively and rapidly print lopinavir/ritonavir , chloroquine , and hydroxychloroquine pills . thus , 3d technology has the potential to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry , making drug research , development and production applicable to covid-19 patients . \n\n as the covid-19 outbreak rapidly evolves , there has been a personal protective equipment shortage globally . 3d printing inventions can be rapidly applied to address these deficiencies . cost , processing time , testing , and manpower are potential barriers to creating 3d-printed personal protective equipment . however , the synthetic polymer biomaterials needed for 3d-printed personal protective equipment are exact or very similar in composition to the standard manufacturing grade products ( i.e . n95 masks provides the same fluid barrier and air filtration protection ) . moreover , these synthetic polymer materials are readily available and cost effective ( i.e . polypropylene is 12.47 cents per pound ) . 3d printer costs vary but are an excellent investment with labor performed via robotics . in conjunction with flattening the curve via social distancing , this pioneering technology can provide adequate personal protective equipment for health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic . \n\n abbreviations : \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) \n\n three-dimensional ( 3d ) \n\n polypropylene ( pp ) \n\n

00010010	transmission potential of the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) onboard the diamond princess cruises ship , 2020 \n\n an outbreak of covid-19 developed aboard the princess cruises ship during january-february 2020 . using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members , we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak . our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore ( approximate range : 1.1-7 ) . our findings suggest that rt decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control . most recent estimates of rt reached values largely below the epidemic threshold , indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n introduction \n\n while the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) spread rapidly throughout china for several weeks since december 2019 , the virus had not taken off outside china in part due to the unprecedented social distancing measures that the chinese government put in place . one exception is the outbreak of covid-19 that developed aboard the diamond princess ship which was detected in early february when one of its passengers , a traveler from hong kong , tested positive for the novel coronavirus . the number of cases in the diamond princess ship quickly jumped to 454 confirmed cases by february 18 , 2020 . in contrast , the total number of cases in singapore , one of the countries with the highest number of covid-19 cases after china , was only 77 at the time . \n\n accumulating evidence indicates that the novel coronavirus can spread widely in confined settings including hospitals , cruise ships , prisons , and churches . in wuhan city , china , outbreaks inside health care settings led to the infection of hundreds of health professionals . in tokyo , japan , most of the reported infections have been linked to a party inside a traditional wooden ship , called yakatabune while most of the infections in korea have affected members of one church and one hospital . \n\n tracking the evolution of the transmission potential of covid-19 in different confined settings and how it compares with that of other respiratory diseases such influenza has public health implications . when outbreaks occur in confined settings , it is useful to investigate how the effective reproduction number changes as a result of interventions strategies such as the quarantine that the japanese government imposed on travelers and crew members aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n in this study we sought to characterize the temporal variation in the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak aboard the princess cruises ship using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data by dates of symptoms onset describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members . \n\n epidemiological incidence cases \n\n in yokohama , japan , an outbreak of covid-19 has been unfolding on board the princess cruise ship , which has been under quarantine orders since february 5 , 2020 , after a former passenger of the diamond princess ship tested positive for the virus after disembarking in hong kong . as of february 22 , 2020 , two days after the scheduled two-week quarantine came to an end , a total of 621 symptomatic and asymptomatic people including one quarantine officer , one nurse and one administrative officer tested positive for covid-19 out of the 3711 passengers and crew members on board . laboratory tests by pcr that prioritize symptomatic or high-risk groups have been conducted . \n\n incidence curves of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases of covid-19 among passengers and crew members of the outbreak unfolding aboard the princess cruises ship are publicly available from the national institute of infectious diseases , japan ( niid ) website . daily time series of symptomatic patients , from january 20 , 2020 to february 18 , 2020 were extracted . however , to reconstruct the trajectory of the epidemic , only 197 cases have dates of symptoms onset are available out of a total of 300 confirmed symptomatic cases . \n\n of the 103 symptomatic cases with missing onset dates , a total of the 79 cases are passengers while 24 cases are crew members . moreover , out of the 79 passenger cases , 30 cases were reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 21 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 28 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . of 24 crew member cases , 1 case was reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 15 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 8 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . \n\n epidemiological modeling \n\n we connected the daily incidence series with a discrete-time integral equation to describe the epidemic dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . specifically , let fs denote the probability mass function of the serial interval of covid-19 , where the serial interval is defined as the time from illness onset in the primary case to time of illness onset in the secondary case . then fs , of length s days , is given by \n\n for s > 0 , f ( s ) represents the cumulative distribution function of the gamma distribution . we characterized the expected number of new incident cases e [ ci , t ] in type i at symptom onset week t as follows , where rij denotes the average number of cases of type i infected by a single individual of type j . here we assume that the incidence , ci , t , follows a poisson sampling process with expected value e [ ci , t ] . \n\n the reproduction matrix for each type is given by \n\n this matrix is referred to as a next-generation matrix ( ngm ) in a fully susceptible population ( , pp . 873-885 ) . using this matrix , we derive the instantaneous time-dependent effective reproduction number , rt , for the entire transmission dynamics from the largest eigenvalue of the ngm . under the assumption that the per-contact infection probability and the generation interval are consistent over time regardless of the type of infection , the ngm quantifies the within type and inter-type patterns of transmission . the sum of the value in column j is the reproduction number for a specific type j . \n\n serial interval estimates of covid-19 were derived from previous studies of covid-19 , indicating that it follows a gamma distribution with the mean and sd at 7.5 and 3.4 days , respectively , based on ref .. the maximum value of the serial interval was fixed at 20 days as the cumulative probability distribution of the gamma distribution up to 20 days reaches 0.991 . \n\n we estimated model parameters and made projections using a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) method in a bayesian framework . point estimates and corresponding 95 % credibility intervals were drawn from the posterior probability distribution . all statistical analyses were conducted in r version 3.5.2 ( r foundation for statistical computing , vienna , austria ) and the 'rstan ' package ( no-u-turn-sampler ( nuts ) ) ( see table 1 ) . \n\n result \n\n day date event 1 jan/20/2020 departed from the

95 % cri : 0.3 , 0.8 ) for crew to crew . although vaccines are still in early development stages as of february 2020 , based on our findings , the corresponding target vaccination coverage to contain

of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 . passenger and crew also have total ( within-type and inter-type ) rt values largely below the epidemic threshold , with only small percentages at 0 % and 9 % above the epidemic threshold , respectively ( table 3 ) . \n\n discussion \n\n this is the first study to assess the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak that unfolded aboard the diamond princess ship , january-february 2020 . the overall mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore in the range 1.1-7 . however , following the implementation of the quarantine period , the overall rt decreased substantially compared to values estimated during the early stage , but it exhibited fluctuations around the epidemic threshold , which likely prolonged the outbreak . \n\n our results indicate that rt declined following the quarantine measures implemented by the japanese government on february 5 relative to values during the early phase of the outbreak . importantly , only those passengers and crew who tested positive for the novel coronavirus were permitted to disembark the diamond princess ship , with more than 80 percentage of the passengers and crews still on board as of february 18 , 2020 . our latest overall estimate of rt at 0.35 ( 95 % cri : 0.02 , 2.19 ) with only 2 % of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 suggested a low probability of observing a subsequent outbreak aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n our findings indicate that the passenger-to-passenger transmission type dominated the transmission dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . the rapid increase in the overall rt from day 12 ( january 31 , 2020 ) to day 19 ( february 7 , 2020 ) is greatly influenced by the increase in passenger-to-passenger transmission , and this time period covers the time lag between february 1 , 2020 when the index covid-19 case was reported and february 5 , 2020 when the japanese government requested the passengers to stay inside their cabin after the detection of a cluster of covid-19 positive cases . upon the implementation of the quarantine orders , the overall rt and rt for passengers aboard the diamond princess ship declined thereafter , while rt among crew maintained a steady level and only started to decline on day 25 of the outbreak ( february 13 , 2020 ) . this is consistent with the fact that passengers staying inside their cabins led to a substantial decline in passenger-to-passenger transmission type except for their interaction with cabin mates . indeed , the proportion of secondary infections inside the cabins increased from 7 % ( 1/15 ) on february 6 , 43 % ( 3/7 ) on february 10 , 2020 to 100 % ( 1/1 ) on february 14 , 2020 . thus , a high proportion of the symptomatic cases after the quarantine gradually shifted from largely passenger cases to crew cases . indeed , despite their potential risk of acquiring the infection , crews had to continue to work to deliver services to isolated passengers . the distribution of the median re by transmission type suggests that other transmission types likely contributed to this outbreak to some extent ( fig . 3 ) . because one quarantine officer , one nurse , and one administrative officer contracted covid-19 aboard the diamond princess ship , the infection risk continued to be significant inside the diamond princess ship . \n\n as for the crude asymptomatic ratios by age groups , they show significant differences across age groups . however , these crude ratios are severely influenced by the timing of specimen collection relative to the infection time . hence , these ratios could be better ascertained if additional data with the timing of specimen collection becomes available . \n\n several limitations should be listed . first , a total of 103 laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases with unknown onset dates were not incorporated in our analysis . although the high proportion of unavailable data ( 34 % ( 103/300 ) ) likely influenced a downward bias in estimates of transmission potential , our estimates still point to the high transmission potential of covid-19 inside confined settings . second , it is possible that reporting delays could have influenced our latest estimates of the effective reproduction number . in fact , the us government recently sent a chartered flight to transport the american passengers on board the diamond princess ship , and after the disembarkation process , a total of 14 american passengers tested positive for the disease on february 16 , 2020 . this event also contributes to a downward bias in r although the number of cases does not exceed the peak of the outbreak , further supporting the potent transmissibility of covid-19 in confined settings . \n\n our most recent estimate of the effective reproduction number of the ongoing covid-19 epidemic on board the diamond princess ship was largely below the epidemic threshold of 1.0 , which suggested a very low probability of observing secondary outbreaks of the disease in the diamond princess ship . \n\n funding statement \n\n km acknowledges support from the japan society for the promotion of science kakenhi grant number 18k17368 and from

00001000	contact transmission of covid-19 in south korea : novel investigation techniques for tracing contacts \n\n in the epidemiological investigation of an infectious disease , investigating , classifying , tracking , and managing contacts by identifying the patient 's route are important for preventing further transmission of the disease . however , omissions and errors in previous activities can occur when the investigation is performed through only a proxy interview with the patient . to overcome these limitations , methods that can objectively verify the patient 's claims ( medical facility records , global positioning system , card transactions , and closed-circuit television ) were used for the recent ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 contact investigations in south korea . \n\n introduction \n\n an epidemiological investigation aims to quickly determine the prevalence of an infectious disease whilst simultaneously revealing the cause , and source of the disease , and explore the transmission process to ultimately prevent the spread of the infectious disease . as individuals become the source of the infectious disease , and if person-to-person transmission is suspected , it is important to immediately identify , and manage people that are in close contact with suspected patients . in particular , if there are several unknown epidemiological and clinical characteristics , and an effective medical intervention is lacking ( as in the case of new infectious diseases such as covid-19 ) , contact management becomes 1 of the core strategies to minimize additional transmission . for these strategies to be successful , it is necessary to evaluate between-person exposure risk in all locations where there have been confirmed cases ( after the onset of symptoms ) , and to classify contact persons based on this risk . furthermore , it is also important to eliminate the possibility of exposure to infection in the places visited by the confirmed patient , by performing the appropriate disinfection of areas that can harbor environmental contamination . however , traditional investigative methods , depending on the patient or proxy interview , has the limitation of omissions and errors of previous activities . \n\n the covid-19 outbreak in china occurred on december 8th , 2019 , and the first case in korea was reported on january 20th , 2020 . as of february 14th , the total number of confirmed cases of covid-19 in korea was 28 . in the current epidemiological investigation contact investigation techniques that were used on a limited basis for the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) outbreak in 2015 , are being used in all confirmed cases of covid-19 . \n\n this report will provide a general overview of the contact investigation from the covid-19 national emergency response center , epidemiology and case management team and describe the various methods used to evaluate exposure risk . \n\n results \n\n covid-19 contact investigation and management comprised of the following : 1 ) determination of the location of the contact ( patient route ) , 2 ) exposure risk evaluation , 3 ) contact classification , and 4 ) contact management . the location of the contact was determined through the process of preliminary identification , by interviewing patients , and their acquaintances , and by objective verification of the investigated information . exposure risk evaluation was performed depending on the route of disease transmission , patient characteristics , and environmental characteristics . based on the results of the evaluation , the contacts were classified into close and casual contacts depending on the exposure . the method of managing the classified contacts was largely distinguished between movement restriction and symptom monitoring . movement restriction is a legal public health order , and quarantine ( isolation ) , home isolation , or controlled travel is enacted . symptom monitoring was performed as either active or passive monitoring , depending on the exposure risk ( figure 1 ) . \n\n the methods used to overcome recall and confirmation biases that can occur while determining the location of the contact include checking medical facilities records , phone-based global positioning system ( gps ) , card transaction records , and closed-circuit television ( cctv ; table 1 ) . \n\n 1 . history of using medical facilities and visiting pharmacies \n\n history of using medical facilities , and visiting pharmacies was used to estimate the window of time of infection , through an accurate evaluation of the clinical symptoms of the infectious disease , and initial onset of the symptoms . if a medical facility was included in the patient 's route , quarantine of the medical facility was conducted . \n\n 2 . gps \n\n consistency in the recall of the route of the patients identified through interview was evaluated . additionally , identification of the routes that the patient could not remember was also possible . however , another person 's information can be misunderstood as the patient 's information if the phone is not owned by or carried by the patient . gps uses cellular phone networks , therefore there are limitations in identifying the exact locations of a patient 's route . \n\n 3. credit card transaction log \n\n credit card transaction logs were used to assess the consistency in the route of the patient identified through interview , and the scope of contacts was assessed by specifying the locations visited . however , if the patient did not use a credit card under their name or if another person used the patient 's card , the information may be misinterpreted . thus , rechecking the contents of the credit card log was necessary , and instances of not being able to use the information at the appropriate time may occur . \n\n 4 . cctv \n\n by checking the video footage of the location of a patient 's path , cctv provided help to identify the details of each situation . for example , cctv was used to evaluate the level of exposure risk by identifying whether the patient wore masks , or had respiratory symptoms such as a cough . the limitations of using cctv were the lengthy time required to check the cctv , and the accuracy of patient identification if the cctv was not inside the facility or the patient was in a blind spot of the camera . \n\n discussion \n\n based on the experience of the mers outbreak in 2015 , laws were revised to supplement the areas that were lacking at the time . korea centers for disease control and prevention were able to use relevant information in epidemiological investigations to contain and prevent infection , thus enabling the establishment of a more comprehensive management of infectious diseases . furthermore , making accurate information available to the general public helps to minimize fear and confusion with respect to the risk of transmissibility of the disease . the use of methods that have objectively verified the patient 's route claims ( medical facility records , gps , card transactions , and cctv ) for covid-19 contact investigations in south korea has provided accurate information on the location , and time of exposure , and details of the situation , thus reducing omissions in a patient 's route due to recall or confirmation bias that may have arisen from patient or proxy interviews . \n\n however , the publicization of a patient 's route for the public 's benefit infringes upon the privacy of the patient . thus , it is necessary to establish a protocol to protect privacy . equally , more effort should be taken to provide accurate information to the public . patient information that is unrelated to the communication of risk of infectious diseases must be protected by clearly defining the standards of publicization and reporting of patient information for the public 's benefit when an infectious disease is prevalent . \n\n with regards to responding to the recent prevalence of covid-19 , korea centers for disease control and prevention are performing defense activities to contain and prevent infection at the appropriate time , with more objective and accurate methods for monitoring patient contacts by using personal information . however , an evaluation of the effectiveness of these monitoring methods when multiple patients are involved , is necessary after the situation has been controlled . epidemiological investigations require the collaboration of various related persons and must be conducted through a strict verification process . furthermore , investigations must be performed using systematic processes with scientific methods and principles , and cycles of continuous evaluation and feedback to identify the etiology , extent , progression and therapy for the infectious disease and the development of public health policies . \n\n conflicts of interest \n\n the authors declare no competing

00001000	strategic planning to augment the testing capacity for covid-19 in india . \n\n background & objectives : nearly 5,500 tests for coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) had been conducted on march 31 , 2020 across the indian council of medical research ( icmr ) -approved public and private laboratories in india . given the need to rapidly increase testing coverage , we undertook an exercise to explore and quantify interventions to increase the daily real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qrt-pcr ) -based testing capacity over the next few months . the objective of this exercise was to prepare a potential plan to scale-up covid-19 testing in india in the public sector . methods : potential increase in daily testing capacity of the existing public laboratories was calculated across the three base scenarios of shifts ( 9 , 16 and 24 h ) . additional testing capacity was added for each shift scenario based on interventions ranging from procurement of additional qrt-pcr machines , leveraging spare capacity on available qrt-pcr machines not drafted into covid-19 testing , to in-laboratory process optimization efforts . results : moving to a 24 h working model in the existing approved laboratories can enhance the daily testing capacity to 40,464 tests/day . the capacity can be further bolstered by leveraging qrt-pcr and nucleic acid amplification test ( naat ) -based machines available with the multidisciplinary research units ( mrus ) , national aids control organisation ( naco ) and national tuberculosis elimination programme ( ntep ) . using combination/multiplex kits , and provision of automated rna extraction platforms at all laboratories could also optimize run time and contribute to capacity increase by 1.5-2 times . interpretation & conclusions : adopting these interventions could help increase public sector 's daily testing capacity to nearly 100,000-120,000 tests/day . it is important to note that utilization of the scaled-up testing capacity will require deployment of additional workforce , procurement of corresponding commodities for testing and scale-up of sample collection and transportation efforts . 
01100000	using integrated computational approaches to identify safe and rapid treatment for sars-cov-2 \n\n abstract \n\n sars-cov-2 is a new generation of coronavirus , which was first determined in wuhan , china , in december 2019 . so far , however , there no effective treatment has been found to stop this new generation of coronavirus but discovering of the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 main protease ( sars-cov-2 mpro ) may facilitate searching for new therapies for sars-cov-2 . the aim was to assess the effectiveness of available fda approved drugs which can construct a covalent bond with cys145 inside binding site sars-cov-2 main protease by using covalent docking screening . we conducted the covdock module mmgbsa module in the schrodinger suite 2020-1 , to examine the covalent bonding utilizing . besides , we submitted the top three drugs to molecular dynamics simulations via gromacs 2018.1 . the covalent docking showed that saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir and prevacid have the highest binding energies mmgbsa of -72.17 , -72.02 , -65.19 , -57.65 , -54.25 , -51.8 , and -51.14 kcal/mol , respectively . the 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation was conducted for saquinavir , ritonavir and remdesivir to evaluate the stability of these drugs inside the binding pocket of sars-cov-2 main protease . the current study provides a powerful in silico results , means for rapid screening of drugs as anti-protease medications and recommend that the above-mentioned drugs can be used in the treatment of sars-cov-2 in combined or sole therapy . \n\n communicated by ramaswamy h. sarma \n\n introduction \n\n sars-cov-2 also called 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ' abbreviated sars-cov-2 was recognized to be the causative of atypical pneumonia ( joshi , ; pant et al. , ) outbreak in wuhan , china ( hasan , ; s. a. khan et al. , 2020 ) . the virus belongs to the family known as 'coronaviruses ' because of the crown-like appearance of spikes glycoproteins on the envelope under an electron microscope ( y chen et al. , ) . world health organization ( who ) recently announced that the virus transforms from epidemic to pandemic , which requires urgent intervention to prevent the growing spread of the virus across the globe ( chan et al. , ) . the total confirmed cases 2,347,884 with 738,923 cases in the united state of america ( usa ) alone and the total death of 161,138 ( as of april 19 ) , with mortality estimated within 2 % and about 3.4 % , according to estimates of approved cases and death worldwide ( n. chen et al. , ) . the most familiar is a virus that arose from the rhinolophus bat which is > 96 % homologous with the modern sars-cov-2 virus and it is just 79 % homologous with the initial sars-cov ( fisher & heymann , ) . the fast-growing number of infected cases globally urged the world health organization to announce a state of global health emergency to correlate scientific and medical disciplines to develop rapidly an effective treatment for patients , ( morse et al. , ; sarma et al. , ) elderly patients and people with severe underlying health diseases like heart diseases , lung illness , and diabetic patients , for instance , appear to be at greater risk of revealing severe sars-cov-2 requires immediate intervention rather than waiting virus vaccine which may require 1 year to be available ( enayatkhani , ) . while drug repurposing could be a short-term and fast resolution to handle sars-cov-2 patients ( elfiky , ; r. j. khan et al. , 2020 ; kumar et al. , ) , repurposing existing drugs can offer a good choice to overcome the virus and offer better risk-versus trade-off as compared with discovering new drug and can help overcome time waiting for new therapy rather than use the available resources ( elmezayen , ; muralidharan , ) one successful repurposing drug story includes duloxetine which originally developed for depression and fda approved as the first-in-class choice for stress urinary incontinence ( sweeney & chancellor , ) , duloxetine initially created as antidepressant also is now passed to phase iii clinical trials as a first-in-class treatment for premature ejaculation ( mcmahon , ) and thalidomide , which had a tragic start as an over-the-counter sedative for morning sickness in pregnancy is now being applied to manage leprosy and multiple myeloma ( hideshima & anderson , ) . \n\n as a result of , a newly issued x-ray crystal of sars-cov-2 main protein ( mpro ) , we planning to use computational approaches ( cameron et al. , 2013 ) to contribute to find an effective treatment for sars-cov-2.thereby , computational analyses speed up these approaches since they allow to handle millions of data simultaneously ( gupta et al. , 2020 ) . molecular docking includes a set of computational methods and algorithms that aimed to identify novel relationships between chemical ligands and targets through using the modelling of their direct physical interaction ( aanouz , ; ekins et al. , ) . in present study , we attend to evaluate some of approved drugs to be as covalent binders , irreversible interactions , which can provide a powerful strategy to fight against epidemic viruses . and molecular dynamics simulations can give a more detail for the image which got from molecular covalent docking . \n\n materials and methods \n\n covalent virtual screening \n\n the crystal structure of fda-available covalent drugs which available in table 1 were selected based on the review of kumalo et al . and some of the antiviral drugs that can form a covalent bond to the target protein . and we aim also here to redirect them for other indications specially to see their possibility to fight against sars-cov-2 . thence , we searched about the chosen drugs in pubchem ( https : //pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) to identify the possibility of the selected drugs to be as covalent binders toward sars-cov-2 mpro . where , pubchem provides detailed information about the selected drugs rather than other repositories , especially , the property of drug to form covalent bond . before starting covalent docking , we downloaded the selected drugs one by one and optimize them by using the ligprep ( lim et al. , ) based on the opls_2005 force field and generated possible state employing epik in the schrodinger 2020 ( elfiky ; s. a. khan et al.,2020 ) . in the next step , the structure of sars-cov-2 mpro ( 6lu7 ) was downloaded from protein data bank ( http : //www.rcsb.org/pdb ) ( jin et al . , ) . the protease structure was optimized by adding hydrogens , removing water molecules and optimizing charge using the protein preparation wizard module ( kumalo et al. , ) in schrodinger suite 2020-1 . the covalent docking protocol was preferred since the cysteine 145 residue which is available in the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro considered as a vital residue that can form a covalent bond with the drug if it can interact covalently . the different mechanisms for the cys145-fda drug were mentioned in table 1 based on the nature of the drug so that the reactive functional group on the ligand and receptor residue are identified and the bond is formed between the correct atoms . these covalently docked complexes were created using covdock in schrodinger suite 2020-1 . finally , we selected the lowest the mmgbsa value for each drug as a propriate conformation of the drug inside the binding pocket . \n\n entry name pubchem id molecular

prime mm-gbsa modules ( vijayakumar et al. , ) in the schrodinger ( 2020 ) . the best poses of selected drugs : sars-cov-2 mpro : were chosen to obtain the binding free energy calculation . prime mmgbsa is a method that combines optimized potential for liquid simulations-all atoms ( oplsaa ) force field , molecular mechanics energies ( emm ) , an sgb solvation model for polar solvation ( gsgb ) , and a non-polar solvation term ( gnp ) composed of the non-polar solvent accessible surface area and van der waals interactions . the total binding free energy : delta gbind = gcomplex - ( g-protein + gligand ) . \n\n molecular dynamics simulation \n\n molecular dynamics simulations are a decision-making process for inspections of protein-drug complexes ' stabilities ( al-khafaji & taskin tok , ) . it is used to clarify the dynamic behavior at an atomic level of biological systems , which is hard to handle in labs ( shukla et al. , ) . in the current study , we conducted molecular dynamics simulations for the top three drugs based on mmgbsa values . the got protein-drug complex structures from covalent docking were submitted to md simulations ( saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir with sars-cov-2 mpro ) . we hired gromacs 2018.1 to run 50 ns md simulations ( abraham et al. , ) . charmm 27 force field for all atoms were chosen to run md simulation ( bjelkmar et al. , ) . we used swiss param to produce the topologies of drugs ( zoete et al. , ) . all protein-drug systems were solvated with three-point transferable intermolecular potential ( tip3p ) and their charges were neutralized via adding na or cl ions . in the following step , the protein-drugs systems were energetically minimized through the steepest descent algorithm at a tolerance value of 1000 kj/mol.nm . then the equilibration with position restraint on the protein molecules for 0.1 ns using nvt and npt ensembles were done . electrostatic interactions were evaluated by particle mesh ewald summation ( darden et al. , ) . we performed the molecular dynamics simulation with no restraint on the protein molecules or ligand to determine the stability in the final step ( time step of 0.015 ns ) . rmsd , rmsf , rg , and number of hydrogen bonds were chosen to analyze md trajectories by using gromacs utilities . \n\n principal component analysis \n\n the principal component analysis ( pca ) approach was employed to calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues and their projection along with the first two principal components ( al-khafaji & taskin tok , ) . this approach is based on the protocol of gromacs 2018.1 ( abraham et al. , ) . it is used to simplify the effect of drugs on the dynamic motion of the targeted protein where it extracts the dynamic motions in simulations that are required for their biological function ( amadei et al. , ) . we got the principal component analysis from the md trajectories . a series of eigenvectors and eigenvalues were generated by diagonalizing the matrix . we chose trajectories of the protein backbone of the complexes to get 2 d-projection of motion of trajectory . \n\n results \n\n to assess the possibility of selected fda drugs to work as treatment of sars-cov-2 , the covalent docking was utilized to screen the selected library and rank them according to their binding affinities . the calculated binding free energies of some available drugs using docking score , glide gscore , and ensemble-average mm/gbsa are shown in table 1 . \n\n to validate our covalent docking results , the correlation between mmgbsa and docking score was constructed ( figure 1 ) . the binding energy mmgbsa-docking score correlation shows a good correlation ( r2 = 0.6299 ) . based on this correlation , we chose the top three ranked-mmgbsa and docking score values of fda drugs for dissection their binding modes inside the binding site . covalent docking showed that saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir , and prevacid have -72.17 , -72.02 , -65.19 , -57.65 , -54.25 , -51.8 , and -51.14 , respectively . where all the top-eight fda drugs show a higher affinity to form a covalent , irreversible bond with cys145 of sars-cov-2 mpro . here we investigated the role of molecular weight upon the affinity of selected drugs to bind covalently to cys145 , whereas 57 % of selected drugs which have molecular weight over than 600 g/mol ( figure 2 ) . and have higher free binding energy mmgbsa than -50 kcal/mol . while the ratio of selected drugs decreased to be 16 % of drugs which can form covalent bonding with over than -50 kcal/mol . surprisingly , none of the selected drugs which have a molecular weight below than 300 g/mol can form a good affinity of binding energy . this indicates that higher molecular weight covalent warheads can form stable and efficient binding energy . \n\n the correlation between mmgbsa binding energies and docking score . \n\n effect of molecular weight upon the mmgbsa binding energy . \n\n docked complex analyses \n\n what stands out in the table 1 is saquinavir has the highest binding affinity ( lowest binding energy mmgbsa of 72.17 kcal/mol ) . therefore , the deep examination of saquinavir is needed . figure 3 shows that saquinavir not only formed covalent bond of 1.81 a with cys145 but also formed five hydrogen bonds inside the pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro . in the second rank ritonavir as presented in table 1 has -72.02 kcal/mol . \n\n covalent docking analysis of saquinavir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n this high affinity resulted from covalent bond between ritonavir and cys145 of 1.82 a ( figure 4 ) through nucleophilic addition to double bond reaction besides it interacted within binding site by forming three hydrogen bonds . despite remdesivir formed covalent bond with cys145 of 1.82 a and three hydrogen bonds ( figure 5 ) and this is similar to ritonavir , but the mmgbsa value is lower than that of ritonavir this may due to nature of reaction which in remdesivir nucleophilic addition to triple bond . \n\n covalent docking analysis of ritonavir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n covalent docking analysis of remdesivir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n molecular dynamic simulation \n\n the effect of drug-protein interactions upon dynamics of biological system is a fundamental in drug discovery thereby we used rmsd to investigate the influence of saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir upon the stability of sars-cov-2 mpro . we utilized gromacs to execute the md simulations of 50 ns for three drug-protein systems besides of apo protein . rmsd fluctuations for both apo and hollo forms were measured and presented . the rmsd was calculated to assess the overall dynamics , stability , and convergence of the various systems and the results are presented in figure 6 ( a ) . \n\n analysis of rmsd , rmsf , rg and hydrogen bonding of saquinvir-sars-cov-2 mpro , ritonavir- sars-cov-2 mpro and remdesivir- sars-cov-2 mpro . ( a ) the protein 's backbone rmsd values with respect to time . ( b ) rmsf of the protein 's backbone with respect to position of residue in the protein . ( c ) rg of the protein backbone over the entire time of md simulation . ( d ) the number of hydrogen bonds through all the time of md simulation . \n\n figure 6 ( a ) shows there is a significant decrease in the rmsd value when sars-cov-2 main protease whether it bound to saquinavir , ritonavir , or remedisivir . further analysis revealed that the rmsd average of apo sars-cov-2 main protease was 0.294 nm but when it bound to saquinavir , ritonavir , and remedisivir the rmsd averages were.01865 , 0.2130 , and 0.2053 nm , respectively . another significant aspect of md simulation is the flexibility of protein 's backbone which can be assessed through measuring rmsf value . the results of the comparative analysis between these drugs and their effects upon sars-cov-2 main protease are illustrated in figure 6 ( b ) . closer scrutiny of figure 6 ( b ) exhibits the binding of saquinavir diminished the fluctuations of the protein 's backbone . and behavior is also can be seen from figure 6 ( b ) where the binding of both ritonavir and remedisivir led to reducing the flexibility of the protein . the radius of gyration ( rg ) is a definition of system 's density , and substantially influences the folding rate and stability of proteins . rg was employed to assess the compactness of all complexes . in this work , rg values are in agreement with rmsf values where there are no significant differences between apo form and hollo forms as presented in figure 6 ( c ) . this reveals that protein remained stable and compact all through the 50 ns time . the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds is a vital aspect to give an impression about the stability of drug and protein . also , the number of hydrogen bonds is relevant to the binding scores of molecular docking process . we calculated the hydrogen bonds over time to validate the stable interactions between top three drugs and their corresponding target . as seen in the figure 6 ( d ) the ritonavir has highest order of hydrogen bonding ( the average =3.35 ) , while saquinavir has an average of 1.68 . \n\n principle component analysis ( pca ) \n\n the essential dynamic method is a tool to explore the dynamical behavior in the space of sars-cov-2 main protease combined with saquinavir , ritonavir , and remedisivir . basically , the comparison of the drug-bound sars-cov-2 mpro and drug-unbound was made as reference . in order to further understand the configurational space , we selected the first two principal components ( pc1 , pc2 ) to analyze their projection of trajectories during the simulations of ligand free and ligand bound sars-cov-2 mpro of the phase space ( shown in figure 7 ) . during the four system simulations , the results clearly show that the unbound ligand protein covered a wider region of phase space , while all three drug-protein system occupied a smaller region of phase space . especially , saquinavir reduced the essential dynamics to lowest degree of functional motions as compared with another drugs . moreover , the pca results suggest that the drug-bound sars-cov-2 mpro is more stable than ligand-unbound sars-cov-2 mpro form of sars-cov-2 mpro . in short , the pca results are also in agreement with the rmsd and rmsf results , which enhance the validity of the performed analysis . \n\n two-dimensional projection of motion of trajectory of sars-cov-2 mpro bound with drugs over the pc1 and pc2 . \n\n discussion \n\n sars-cov-2 causes major pandemic health issue since its spread across the world and can infect humans mainly respiratory system causing severe pneumonia with no vaccine and drug treatment available . prior study that have referred to the significance of molecular docking to determine effective treatment in short time ( wu , et al. , ) . in reviewing the literature , we took the advantage of possibility of fda available drugs that can be as a covalent warhead to inhibit the sars-cov-2 mpro with cys145 . an initial objective of the project was to identify effective and applicable treatment . the present study focused on the main protease ( mpro ) , especially pdb id ( 6lu7 ) as a potential target for several marketed drugs as possible therapeutic option to combat the virus to see the capability of these drugs to bind with the cysteine 145 residue which is available in the binding site of sars-cov-2 main protease . the mpro in sars-cov-2 is necessary for the proteolytic maturation of the virus targeting this protein to limit the expansion of infection by hindering the cleavage of the viral polyprotein . the most interesting finding was that the both saquinavir and ritonavir have the same affinity ( binding energy mmgbsa -72 kcal/mol ) to block binding site of sars-cov-2 with irreversible interactions . this study supports evidence from previous observations that lopinavir/ritonavir can inhibit sars-cov-2 ( lim et al. , ) . another important outcome was that the remdesivir comes in second rank with binding affinity ( mmgbsa = -65 kcal/mol ) . whereas previous research has established that remdesivir can inhibit sars-cov-2 m proenzyme through docking results . another significant finding , delavirdine computationally showed the ability to form irreversible covalent bond of -57.65 kcal/mol mmgbsa binding energy . moreover , indinavir and cefuroxime axetil exhibited the possibility to halt the pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro by forming stable interaction through covalent bonding and hydrogen bonding ( mmgbsa binding energies -54 kcal/mol ) . furthermore , oseltamivir and prevacid exhibited same affinity to bind with sars-cov-2 protease through one covalent bond and one hydrogen bond ( -51 kcal/mol ) , which is a good explanation for the activity of oseltamivir ( peeri et al. , ) . in this study , results obtained show the binding affinity of drugs to an active site depends on several factors mainly the ability of a compound to form a covalent bond with amino acid residues of the mpro ( cys145 ) and length of a covalent bond , the number of h-bonds that can form with a pocket of the active site and type of nucleophilic addition of unsaturated bonds . in this concept , the structural features in saquinavir and ritonavir like free amine group ( -nh2 ) , hydroxyl groups ( -oh ) , carbonyl groups ( c=o ) in addition to ether group play key structural feature to form h-bond . results show the promising activities for antiretroviral drugs saquinavir that used for hiv/aids more than ritonavir and remdesivir followed by lopinavir as the best drugs to bind covalently toward sars-cov-2 mpro with lowest energy of binding . as discussed above , saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir , and prevacid showed the ability to block the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro by forming covalent bond and stabilized with hydrogen bonding . \n\n these outcomes are contrary to that of kandeel and al-nazawi ( 2020 ) , they found that ribavirin , telbivudine , vitamin b12 , and nicotinamide can be can form non-bonding interactions . whilst our results showed that , saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir can form irreversible interactions , which are considered an effective way for viral infections . \n\n in the present work , comparative molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir on the conformational and dynamical demeanor in either apo or hollo forms to understand the inhibitory possibility at atomic level . an initial mission of the project was to identify rapid , effective , safe , and available for large proportions of people , so we run covalent docking and mmgbsa to sift the possibility of these drug to form irreversible interactions . therefore , we had chosen these drugs because they carry covalent warheads that can bind covalently to the target . but the docking results are not adequate , so we run md simulations examine how much these drugs are able to form stable interactions with targeted protein . one interesting finding is the rmsd of protein backbone in apo status has higher average value , whereas the binding with top three drugs diminished these rmsd average . another important finding was that the rmsf of protein 's backbone be less flexible when it compared to apo form of sars-cov-2 main protease . it is somewhat surprising that the binding of three drugs have not noted in rg values . it is not yet clear whether the top three drugs can show an evidence to inhibit the targeted protein , thereby we lean on the principal component analysis to analyze the md trajectories to judge without dispute . the most obvious finding to emerge from 2d pca analysis is that the binding of under investigated drugs caused stately impact on essential dynamics of protein by reducing its essential dynamics to its least possible motions . these results seem to be consistent with rmsd results . a possible explanation for this might be that binding of the drugs make the binding site much narrower due to hydrogen bindings this makes the 3d structure of targeted protein more rigid so it will lose its biological functions . it is possible , therefore , that using these available drugs in two ways : either alone or in combined way . these findings suggest the possible use of nominated drugs against sars-cov-2 in short time as approved by covalent docking screening . also , the present results are significant in at least directing the clinicians to use these safe drugs to stop development of corona virus and second giving hope that available drugs that can be efficient treatment . \n\n conclusions \n\n coronavirus today emphasizes as a potential threat to all people worldwide . although extensive researches have been directed to stop sars-cov-2 , but till now there is no medication . meanwhile , the spreading with complicated crisis requires immediate therapy to overcome the spread and minimize mortality of sars-cov-2 . the aim of the present study was to discover effective treatment through repurposing some of available fda-approved drugs against sars-cov-2 mpro . where , they can provide covalent warheads in virtual screening . the most prominent finding to emerge from this study is that the affinity of covalent binder toward sars-cov-2 mpro is ranked : saquinavir > ritonavir > remdesivir > delavirdine > cefuroxime axetil > oseltamivir = prevacid . one of the more noteworthy findings in this study is that md simulation analysis that saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir can form stable interaction inside the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro . also , they restricted the essential motions of protein . overall , the results of screening toward mpret encourage for further clinical evaluations . they can be easy to reach and exploit as persuasive treatments for sars-cov-2 . \n\n acknowledgements \n\n authors thankful for staff membered of gaziantep university institute of health sciences , department of bioinformatics and computational biology . \n\n

00001000	strength , weakness , opportunity , threat ( swot ) analysis of the adaptations to anatomical education in the united kingdom and republic of ireland in response to the coivd-19 pandemic . \n\n the covid-19 pandemic has driven the fastest changes to higher education across the globe , necessitated by social distancing measures preventing any face to face teaching . this has led to an almost immediate switch to distance learning by higher education institutions . anatomy faces some unique challenges . intrinsically , anatomy is a three-dimensional subject that requires a sound understanding of the relationships between structures , often achieved by the study of human cadaveric material , models and virtual resources . this study sought to identify the approaches taken in the united kingdom and republic of ireland to deliver anatomical education through online means . data were collected from 14 different universities in the united kingdom and republic of ireland and compared adopting a thematic analysis approach . once themes were generated , they were collectively brought together using a strength , weakness , opportunity , threat ( swot ) analysis . key themes included the opportunity to develop new online resources and the chance to engage in new academic collaborations . academics frequently mentioned the challenge that time constrains could place on the quality and effectiveness of these resources ; especially as in many cases the aim of these resources is to compensate for a lack of exposure to cadaveric exposure . comparisons of the actions taken by multiple higher education institutions reveals the ways that academics have tried to balance this demand . discussions will facilitate decisions being made by higher education institutions regarding adapting the curriculum and assessment methods in anatomy . 
10001000	early trends for sars-cov-2 infection in central and north texas and impact on other circulating respiratory viruses . \n\n introduction : rapid diagnosis and isolation are key to containing the quick spread of a pandemic agent like sars-cov-2 , which has spread globally since its initial outbreak in wuhan province in china . sars-cov-2 is novel and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal viruses is just becoming apparent . we present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of march , 2020 . methods : this is a retrospective cohort study post launching of sars-cov-2 testing at baylor scott and white hospital ( bswh ) , temple , texas . testing for sars-cov-2 was performed by real-time rt-pcr assay and results were shared with state public health officials for immediate interventions . results : more than 3500 tests were performed during the first two weeks of testing for sars-cov-2 and identified 168 ( 4.7 % ) positive patients . sixty-two ( 3.2 % ) of the 1,912 ambulatory patients and 106 ( 6.3 % ) of the 1,659 ed/inpatients tested were positive . the highest rate of infection ( 6.9 % ) was seen in patients aged 25-34 years , while the lowest rate of infection was seen among patients aged < 25 years old ( 2 % ) . county-specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions . incidentally , this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of seasonal respiratory virus infections , perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness about sars-cov-2 among the general public , as well as the social distancing measures implemented in response to sars-cov-2 . data extracted for bswh from the cdc 's national respiratory and enteric virus surveillance system ( nrevss ) site revealed that influenza incidence was 8.7 % in march 2020 , compared to 25 % in march 2019 . conclusions : this study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management . this study provided sars-cov-2 testing data from ambulatory and inpatient population . epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like sars-cov-2 . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved . 
01000000	reverse vaccinology approach to design a novel multi-epitope vaccine candidate against covid-19 : an in silico study \n\n abstract \n\n at present , novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov , the causative agent of covid-19 ) has caused worldwide social and economic disruption . the disturbing statistics of this infection promoted us to develop an effective vaccine candidate against the covid-19 . in this study , bioinformatics approaches were employed to design and introduce a novel multi-epitope vaccine against 2019-ncov that can potentially trigger both cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell immune responses and investigated its biological activities by computational tools . three known antigenic proteins ( nucleocapsid , orf3a , and membrane protein , hereafter called nom ) from the virus were selected and analyzed for prediction of the potential immunogenic b and t-cell epitopes and then validated using bioinformatics tools . based on in silico analysis , we have constructed a multi-epitope vaccine candidate ( nom ) with five rich-epitopes domain including highly scored t and b-cell epitopes . after predicting and evaluating of the third structure of the protein candidate , the best 3 d predicted model was applied for docking studies with toll-like receptor 4 ( tlr4 ) and hla-a * 11:01 . in the next step , molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation was used to evaluate the stability of the designed fusion protein with tlr4 and hla-a * 11:01 receptors . md studies demonstrated that the nom-tlr4 and nom-hla-a * 11:01 docked models were stable during simulation time . in silico evaluation showed that the designed chimeric protein could simultaneously elicit humoral and cell-mediated immune responses . \n\n communicated by ramaswamy h. sarma \n\n introduction \n\n coronavirus disease covid-19 outbreak began in late december 2019 in wuhan , the capital of hubei province , china ( wang et al. , ) . scientists from all over the world are attempting to investigate this novel virus , known as 2019-ncov , which is highly contagious , and to discover effective interventions to control and prevent the disease ( heymann , ; huang et al. , ) . coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses ( ssrna+ ) belonging to the coronaviridae family . human coronaviruses hcov-229e , hcov-nl63 , hcov-oc43 , and hcov-hku1 are observed in almost one-third of the common cold ( lim et al. , ) . however , recently some cases of human coronavirus infections have led to fatal endemics , including sars ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) , mers ( middle east respiratory syndrome ) and covid-19 that are common diseases between humans and animals whose belong to the genus betacoronavirus of the coronaviridae family ( al-tawfiq et al. , ) . so far , the novel covid-19 has caused more than 700,000 illnesses and more than 33,000 deaths worldwide ( w.h.o. , 2020 ) . the genome size of this virus is about 30 kb and encodes structural and non-structural proteins like other coronaviruses . structural proteins include s protein ( spike ) , e protein ( envelope ) , m protein ( membrane ) , and n protein ( nucleocapsid ) ( ahmed et al. , ) . the increasing rate of covid-19 disease and the high morbidity necessitate the development of a specific and safe vaccine candidate as soon as possible . there is very little known actually about the pathogenesis of the virus ; therefore , an immunoinformatics-based approach to investigate the immunogenic epitopes and vaccine design using data from proteins sequencing of the covid-19 is required . \n\n n protein is the only structural protein that associates with replicase-transcriptase complexes and binds with genomic rna in coronaviruses ( cong et al. , ) . this protein is multifunctional and one of the most crucial structural components of coronaviruses . n protein is a structural and antigenic protein that is involved in packaging , transcription , and replication coronaviruses ( 4 ) . this data showed that n protein is a suitable candidate for targeting drug and vaccine design because this protein is conserved , antigenic and multifunctional ( 6 ) . leung and et al . concluded that n protein can be a suitable vaccine candidate against sars-cov because induce strong antibody and this process may trigger cytokine production ( leung et al. , ) . coronaviruses m protein also has a key role in the assembly of virions . the sars-cov m protein can interact with n protein and make a network of interactions with the genomic rna ( he et al. , ) . ong and et al . the covid-19 antigens such as s , n and m proteins introduced as a vaccine candidate ( 6 ) . this protein has also been studied as an epitope vaccine candidate against sars-cov ( 7 ) . \n\n open reading frame 3a ( orf3a ) is required for viral replication and virulence of sars cov . severe induction of proinflammatory cytokine is a sign of sars-cov and mers-cov infections . orf3a activates both pro-il-1beta gene expression and il-1beta secretion and leads to severe lung injury . ( siu et al. , ) . also , orf3a has an important role in sars-cov assembly or budding with the participation of m and e proteins ( mcbride & fielding , ) . these proteins are not only involved in the pathogenesis of the covid-19 virus but also have high antigenicity ( chan et al. , ; siu et al. , ; xu et al. , ) . in this study e , m , n , orf10 , orf8 , orf3a and m proteins were evaluated by available bioinformatics tools for designing an efficient multi-epitope vaccine for the stimulation of immune responses against covid-19 infection . \n\n since the covid-19 has been recently discovered , little immunological information is available . preliminary studies based on phylogenetic analyses of the covid-19 whole genome have suggested that this virus is very similar to the sars-cov ( 79.7 % identify ) ( 9 , 14 ) . given the apparent similarity between the two viruses , it could be concluded that previous studies on the protective immune responses against sars-cov may be useful for developing a vaccine for covid-19 . previous studies have suggested that both humoral and cellular immunity play important roles in protective responses against this virus ( deming et al. , ; yang et al. , ) . studies revealed that the formation of antibodies against the n protein of sars-cov , an immunogenic protein that is highly expressed during infection , is relatively common in patients infected with this virus ( liu et al. , ; lin et al. , ) . although these antibodies are effective , they have a shorter lifespan in recovering the patients . in addition to the specific humoral immunity , it has been shown that the cd4+ and cd8+ responses provide long-lasting protection against covid-19 . these studies showed that besides antibody-mediated immune response , cellular immunity is critical to induce protectivity in these infections ( liu et al. , ) . the concept of a multi-epitope vaccine is to efficiently identify and assemble b and t-cell epitopes that are more capable of stimulating the immune system and therefore can induce more potent and effective both arms of immune responses . peptides and epitopes have shown to be desirable candidates for vaccine development due to their relatively easy production , chemical stability , and lack of infectious potential ( patronov & doytchinova , ) . the experimental design and production of multi-epitope vaccines have improved dramatically in recent years . these vaccines are mainly made up of b-cell , cd8+ cytolytic t-cell ( ctls ) and cd4+ helper t-cells ( htls ) epitopes ( chiarella et al. , ) . since the antigenic epitopes of a protein could be predicted and detected , therefore the whole protein is not suitable to stimulate an immune response ( testa & philip , ; zheng et al. , ) . during the development of a vaccine candidate against covid-19 , complex pathogenic mechanisms and numerous pathogenic factors should be considered in vaccine formulation . \n\n in the present study , we aimed to design a novel multi-epitope fusion protein ( nucleocapsid , orf3a , and membrane protein or nom ) containing more efficient antigenic epitopes-rich domains . the biological activity of the engineered fusion protein was assessed by bioinformatics tools using the interaction between the vaccine candidate and the innate immune system receptor ( tlr4 ) and cellular immune system receptor ( hla-a * 11:01 ) . we strongly believe that the outcome of the present report will provide a potential vaccine candidate against 2019-ncov . \n\n materials and methods \n\n in this study , we designed a suitable vaccine candidate against covid-19 , by exploiting the programs of reverse vaccinology ( figure 1 ) \n\n strategies employed in the overall study . \n\n retrieval of protein sequences \n\n at first , the amino acid sequences of proteins were retrieved from the national centre for biotechnology information ( ncbi ) at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov in fasta format and performed for subsequent

selected six proteins of covid-19 virus ( table 1 ) that have an essential role in virulence and replication of the virus , and previous studies have highlighted the necessity of these proteins in coronaviruses function . after the antigenic analysis of these proteins , three proteins of n , orf3a , and m were selected for final analysis . \n\n prediction of t-cell ( hla class i and ii ) epitopes \n\n 1d sequence-based screening server rankpep was used to identify t-cell epitopes ( reche & reinherz , ) . this server predicts peptide binders to mhc molecules from protein sequences using the position-specific scoring matrix ( pssm ) . we have selected all hla class i alleles from the selection panel of rankpep server for prediction of epitopes of hla class i . to prediction of epitopes of hla class ii , we considered drb1 * 0101 , drb1 * 0301 , drb1 * 0401 , drb1 * 0701 , drb1 * 0801 , drb1 * 1101 , drb1 * 1301 , and drb1 * 1501 that cover hla variability of over 95 % of the human population worldwide ( kruiswijk et al. , ) . \n\n b-cell epitopes ( linear ) identification \n\n for the prediction of b-cell epitopes , the amino acid sequence was analyzed using bepipred and kolaskar & tongaonkar antigenicity ( http : //www.iedb.org/ ) servers ( vita et al. , ) . bepipred for linear epitope prediction uses both hidden markov model and amino acid propensity scales methods . kolaskar and tongaonkar evaluate the protein for b cell epitopes using the physicochemical properties of the amino acids and their frequencies of occurrence in recognized b cell epitopes ( kolaskar & tongaonkar , ; mirza et al. , ) . \n\n selection of epitope-rich domains and the final sequence \n\n according to the prediction results of the servers used , b cell epitopes and hla class i and ii epitopes that have had high scores were extracted and combined to generate multi-epitope protein . b cell and t cell epitope-rich domains of n , orf3a and m proteins were selected and joined to each other with an aaa linker . \n\n antigenicity and allergenicity evaluation \n\n antigenicity of designed recombinant protein predicted using the vaxijen v2.0 server . the vaxijen classified antigens based on auto cross-covariance ( acc ) transformation of protein sequences into uniform vectors of principal amino acid properties which is a novel alignment-independent method and overcome the limitations of alignment-dependent sequence methods ( doytchinova & flower , ) . the prediction of vaccine candidate allergenicity is essential . the allergenicity of the designed protein was computed by allertop ( http : //www.ddg-pharmfac.net/allertop/ ) . allertop method predicts recombinant protein allergenicity on auto cross-covariance acc that describe residue hydrophobicity , size , abundance , helix- and beta-strand forming propensities ( dimitrov et al. , ) . allertop v.2 has the highest accuracy ( 88.7 % ) compared to several servers for allergen prediction ( dimitrov et al. , ) . \n\n the physicochemical parameters \n\n the analyzed parameters consisted of the molecular weight , theoretical pi , amino acid composition , atomic composition , extinction coefficient , estimated half-life , instability index , aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathicity that were evaluated by protparam online server ( http : //us.expasy.org/tools/ protparam.html ) ( gasteiger et al. , ) . \n\n secondary and tertiary structure prediction \n\n gor was used for the designed protein secondary structure prediction ( https : //npsa-prabi.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat.pl ? page=/npsa/npsa_gor4.html ) ( kloczkowski et al. , ) . gor4 predict protein secondary structure using information theory . \n\n the tertiary structure was built using the galaxy web . galaxyweb server ( http : //galaxy.seoklab.org/ tbm ) is based on the tbm method . this server detects similar proteins and alignment with the target sequence , then make the model and finally perform model refinement ( shin et al. , ) . \n\n tertiary structure refinement and validation \n\n the best-modeled structure was refined using the galaxy refine server at ( http : //galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi ? type=refine ) . galaxy refined the model by molecular dynamics simulation . this method showed one of the best performances in improving protein structure quality . \n\n analysis of the final 3 d model was made using molprobity , prosa and ramachandran plot . ramachandran plot obtained from rampage calculates torsional angles residue-by-residue in protein and indicates that residues are in allowed , favored or outlier regions ( oberholser , ) . prosa web used to recognize the errors in the generated 3 d models using atomic coordinates of the model . prosa web was created z-score ( overall model quality ) and a plot of residue energies of proteins ( wiederstein & sippl , ) . clash analysis is very important for the validation of proteins . molprobity is a structure-validation web service that calculates the clash score , protein-geometry score , poor rotamers , ramachandran plot , and molprobity score . \n\n defining discontinuous b-cell epitopes of designed protein \n\n the interaction between antigen epitopes and antibodies is very essential to eliminate the infection . conformational epitopes are the most important and the most prevalent epitopes that are recognized by antibodies . all conformational epitope prediction methods require the 3 d structures of proteins . discontinuous epitopes of recombinant protein predicted using the ellipro server . this web-based predicts discontinuous epitopes based on protein-antibody interactions . ellipro server predicts conformational and linear b cell epitopes using thornton 's method and by modeller program or blast search of pdb predict and visualize of antibody epitopes ( ponomarenko et al. , ) . \n\n obtaining and preparing the structures of immune receptors and nom recombinant protein \n\n the crystallographic structures of tlr4 ( pdb id : 2z62 ( kim et al. , ) ) and hla-a * 11:01 ( pdb id : 5wjl ( culshaw et al. , 2017 ) ) were obtained from the pdb database ( berman et al. , ) . the structures were cleaned and crystallographic waters and co-crystallized molecules were deleted and only the monomer forms of each receptor were kept . then , the structures of the two receptors and the nom protein were prepared by the dock prep tool in ucsf chimera software ( pettersen et al. , ) where hydrogen atoms and charge were added to the structures to make them ready for the next step . in the next step , to stabilize and relax the structures in an aqueous physiological environment , each of the monomer form of the receptors and the nom protein were simulated for 100 ns . the details of the md simulation will be explained later . \n\n protein-protein molecular docking and refinement \n\n after the md simulation of each receptor and the nom recombinant protein , the last frame of the trajectory of each simulation was extracted and used as the input structures for protein-protein molecular docking . the patchdock webserver ( schneidman-duhovny et al. , ) with default parameters was used to predict the best positions and orientations where the two proteins can have the highest number of favorable interactions . afterward , the top 10 solutions were subjected to firedock webserver ( andrusier et al. , ; mashiach et al. , ) to refine the interaction of protein-protein complexes resulted from molecular docking . the top two complexes from coronavirus nom protein-tlr4 and nom recombinant protein-hla-a * 11:01 complexes were chosen based on global energies . these four complexes were then taken to the next step , md simulation . \n\n molecular dynamics simulation \n\n after performing the protein-protein molecular docking and finding the best orientations of the vaccine candidate and the receptor proteins to interact with one another , the two best-scored complexes were subjected to md simulation . all of the md simulations were done by gromacs 2018 package ( abraham et al. , ) and opls-aa force field ( jorgensen et al. , ) . the monomer form of each protein and also the docked complexes were placed in the center of a triclinic box with a distance of 1 nm from all edges and solvated with tip3p water model ( jorgensen et al. , ) . then , sodium and chloride ions were added to produce a neutral physiological salt concentration of 150 mm . each system was energy minimized , using the steepest descent algorithm , until the fmax was found to be smaller than 10 kj.mol-1nm-1 . all of the covalent bonds were constrained using the linear constraint solver ( lincs ) algorithm ( hess et al. , ) to maintain constant bond lengths . the long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh ewald ( pme ) method ( darden et al. , ; essmann et al. , ) and the cut off radii for coulomb and van der waals short-range interactions were set to 0.9 nm . then 100 ps nvt ( constant number of particles ( n ) , volume ( v ) , and temperature ( t ) ) and 300 ps npt ( constant number of particles ( n ) , pressure ( p ) , and temperature ( t ) ) equilibrations were performed for each system . after the necessary equilibrations , 100 ns of production run were performed for each of the four complexes . finally , simulations were carried out under the periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , set at xyz coordinates to ensure that the atoms had stayed inside the simulation box , and the subsequent analyses were then performed using gromacs utilities , vmd ( humphrey et al. , ) and uscf chimera , and also the plots and the figures were created using daniel 's xl toolbox ( v 7.3.2 ) add-in ( kraus , ) and ezmol ( reynolds et al. , ) . all of the computations were performed on an ubuntu desktop pc , with a [ intel ( r ) xeon ( r ) cpu e5-2630 v3 + nvidia geforce gtx 1080 ] configuration . \n\n mmpbsa binding free energy \n\n the binding free energies of the protein-protein complexes were calculated by molecular mechanics-poisson-boltzmann solvent-accessible surface area , mmpbsa method ( kollman et al. , ) using g_mmpbsa package ( kumari et al. , ) . in this method , the binding free energy is the result of the free energy of the complex minus the sum of the free energies of the ligand and the protein . in our case , the nom recombinant protein is defined as the ligand and the immune receptors are defined as the receptors . the mmpbsa calculation was done for every ns of each simulation trajectories . \n\n results and discussion \n\n defining t-cell epitopes \n\n the results of several studies have shown that strong virus-specific t-cell response is required for the elimination of respiratory virus infections such as sars-cov and influenza a and para-influenza . these studies conclude that future vaccine interventions should also consider strategies to enhance t cell response to provide robust long-term memory ( channappanavar et al. , ; janice oh et al. , ) . studies have shown that high levels of t cell responses against n protein were found 2 years after the patient 's recovery ( peng et al. , ) . antibodies are essential to combat sars-cov infection , and the body needs sars-cov specific cd4+ t helper cells to produce these specific antibodies . also , cd8+ cytotoxic t cells are important for recognizing and killing infected cells , especially in the lungs of infected individuals . we used the rankpep server which covers almost all hla supertypes to predicted different epitops from n , orf3a and m proteins sequence according to hla i and hla ii alleles . antigenic epitopes with high binding affinity score were predicted that are summarized in table 2a-b . \n\n antigen hla_a0201 hla_a0204 hla_a0206 hla_b0702 hla_b51 hla_b5401 hla_b5301 nucleocapsid protein 316-324 299-307 66-74 343-351 66-74 45-53 gmsrigmev

such as measles and rubella reflects the importance of protective antibodies . protection against virus infection such as coronaviruses depends on the simulation of neutralizing antibodies in addition to the t cell-mediated immunity . while cytotoxic lymphocytes can kill infected cells , antibodies have the potential to eliminate infected cells and prevent the infectious virus from infecting a cell ( neutralization ) . sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies block viral entry ( dorner & radbruch , ; hsueh et al. , ) . in this study , for the linear epitope prediction , the bepipred server was employed . bepipred analysis revealed several continuous predicted epitopes of n , orf3a and m proteins . for cross-checking the predicted epitopes , the sequence of all three proteins was also predicted by kolaskar & tongaonkar antigenicity . the linear b-cell epitopes are represented in ( table 3 ) . given that both cellular and humoral immune responses are essential against coronaviruses infection ( janice oh et al. , ) , finally , epitopes that were shared between b cell and t-cell were selected . \n\n selected targets for designing the final vaccine \n\n the main strategy in the present study was to design and construct a novel multi-epitope protein from covid-19 based on in silico methods to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses . due to the low immunogenicity of the epitope , we chose epitope-rich domains to generate a more diverse and robust response ( wieser et al. , ) . based on in silico analysis , five epitope-rich domains including highly scored and shared epitopes between t and b-cell epitopes were selected and joined to each other with a three aaa linker ( table 4 ) . the schematic diagram of designed vaccine domains with linker 's sites has been shown in figure 2 . \n\n the schematic diagram of the vaccine candidate construct consists of n , orf3a and m proteins epitopes of the covid-19 linked together with aaa linkers . \n\n antigen server

allergenicity \n\n prediction of the vaccine candidate antigenicity represents a numerical criterion for the capability of the vaccine to bind to the b- and t-cell receptors and increase the immune response in the host cell . vaxijen v2.0 was used to predict the antigenicity of the designed protein . vaxijen analysis of nom protein showed potent antigenicity 0.5999 with a 0.4 % threshold . the results indicate that the designed protein sequences without adjuvant are antigenic . \n\n allergen proteins induce an ige antibody response ( dimitrov et al. , ) . the designed vaccine candidate must not show an allergic reaction to the body . the allergenicity of the sequence was predicted using the allertop tool . based on prediction approaches in allertop , this protein was not recognized as an allergen . \n\n the physicochemical parameters and protein secondary structure prediction \n\n primary structure analysis nom designed protein ( 337 aa ) has a molecular weight of 37513.57 d. the total number of positively charged residues ( arg + lys ) and negatively charged residues ( asp + glu ) were 19 and 32 respectively . the theoretical isoelectric point ( pi ) was calculated at 9.62 . the instability index ( < 40 ) indicates that the designed protein has high stability for the initiation of an immunogenic reaction . the instability index ( ii ) was 35.75 which classifies the protein as stable . the aliphatic index of nom recombinant protein was calculated 97.92 and indicates this protein has stability in several temperatures . \n\n natively unfolded protein regions and alpha-helix are important forms of structural antigens that can be arranged in their native structure and thus identified by antibodies that are produced in response to infection . ( shey et al. , ) . the composition of the predicted secondary structure of the nom multi-epitope vaccine candidate was 43.92 % ( alpha helix ) , 16.02 % ( extended strand ) , and 40.06 % ( random coil ) . all this information indicates the designed protein is suitable as a vaccine candidate . \n\n tertiary structure prediction and validation \n\n three-dimensional structure was modeled by galaxyweb for our designed protein ( figure 3a ) . this model was used for evaluation and refinement . for validation of the model , prosa-web , ramachandran plot and molprobity were used that compare and analyze the protein structure . the prosa web determined z-score for the best predicted 3 d model ( figure 3b ) . the z-score of the nom predicted model was -4.42 , which is within the range of scores typically found for native proteins of similar size . the ramachandran plot indicates that most of the residues are found in the favored and allowed regions ( 99.7 % ) and only 0.3 % in the outlier region , this shows that the quality of the designed model is satisfactory . phe 282 , asn311 , tyr228 , lys194 , asp223 , ser229 , ser4 , his197 , tyr68 residues were observed in the allowed and outlier regions of ramachandran plot ( figure 3c ) . in molprobity analysis , the all-atom clash score was 9.37 , the molprobity score was 2.21 . all structural images were created using pymol ( the pymol molecular graphics system , version 1.1 , schrodinger , llc ) . \n\n ( a-c ) prediction and validation of tertiary structure of the nom recombinant protein using ( a ) prediction of the

b-cell epitopes from the 3 d structure of nom recombinant protein . discontinuous b-cell epitopes were predicted with scores ranging from0.679 to 0.945 . amino acid residues , the number of residues , sequence location as well as their scores have been listed in tables 5 . the graphical representation of the discontinuous epitopes has been displayed in figure 4 . \n\n three-dimensional

conformational b-cell epitopes from vaccine protein using ellipro server . \n\n establishing the stability of the initial structures \n\n a vaccine can interact with different receptors of the immune system . we have docked designed final constructs ( nom ) with tlr4 and hla-a * 11:01 receptors . the interaction between these receptors and nom recombinant protein induce different immune responses . to achieve a stable and relaxed state of the nom recombinant protein and the immune receptors , a md simulation of 100 ns was performed for each structure . these simulations ensure that the structures are stable enough to be used for protein-protein molecular docking . after 100 ns of the production run , as it is shown in figure 5 , the rmsd ( root mean square distance ) values of the monomers show that the backbone structure of tlr4 ( pdb id : 2z62 ) is very rigid and stable . the structure of the nom recombinant protein also reached stability after about 25 ns after a considerable structural change . the backbone structure of the hla-a * 11:01 ( pdb id : 5wjl ) , however , showed big spikes in the rmsd values but all three structures were visually inspected and were considered stable enough for the next step of the project . \n\n the rmsd values of the simulated monomer forms of the proteins throughput the 100 ns of production runs . \n\n protein-protein molecular docking \n\n to find the best orientation for optimal interaction of the nom protein with the immune receptors we decided to use protein-protein molecular docking . we used patchdock webserver which concentrates on recognizing and matching patterns of the surfaces of the proteins to put them in the best possible positions . afterward , the top 10 best solutions were subjected to the firedock webserver to refine the docked structures . the firedock algorithms refine the docked complexes by side-chain rearrangement and soft rigid-body optimization . the ranking of the docked complexes is based on short-range , long-range , attractive and repulsive interaction energies between the residues of the two proteins , which are all summed up in the global energy or the binding energy of the complexes . we considered global energy as the main criterion for choosing the best complexes and chose the two top-scored solutions with the best global energy . as it is shown in table 6 , the solution numbers 5 and 6 from the nom-tlr4 complex and the solution numbers 2 and 3 , from nom-hla-a * 11:01 complex , were chosen for further calculations . the total energy plots of the simulations are shown in figure 6 . the results showed a strong interaction between designed protein amino acids and receptors . the interactions between the binding receptors and the docked nom protein were visualized using the ucsf chimera program . residues of hla-a * 1101 ( glu53 , asn174 , gly56 , asn174 , glu53 , pro57 ) participated in the interaction with arg49 , ser97 , gln91 , met102 , arg49 and gln91 residues of the candidate vaccine . also , nine residues of tlr4 ( tlr4 lys123 , ile319 , thr66 , ser90 , lys124 , lys46 , his85 , lys123 ) participated in the interaction

simulation of top scored solutions \n\n after the protein-protein molecular docking , 4 solutions were chosen for md simulation , solution numbers 2 and 3 from nom protein-hla-a * 11:01 complex and solution numbers 5 and 6 from nom protein-tlr4 complex . each was simulated for 100 ns . to examine their stability throughout the simulations period , the rmsd values of each protein was analyzed . as it is shown in figure 7 , each protein has different rmsd values and in some of them , the backbone atoms have considerable movements during the simulations . the reason is that the interactions can get optimized and rearranged by introducing water molecules and physiological conditions . the rmsd values of tlr4 in nom protein-tlr4 complexes and the values of hla-a * 11:01 in nom protein-hla-a * 11:01 complexes are very stable and the average values do not reach very high values . however , the rmsd values of the nom protein in every complex reach high values which means that the structure of the vaccine has more movements to refine the interactions with the immune receptors . however , the interactions between the nom recombinant protein and the immune receptors are quite strong and mmpbsa binding energy calculations exhibit great binding energies . as it is shown in table 7 , the van der waals and electrostatic energies of the complexes are strong enough to keep the two proteins in contact with each other . moreover , the deviation of each value is very small which means that the interactions are very stable and consistent throughout the simulations . in another word , the higher scale of rmsd values with consistent binding energies only show that the structure of the nom protein is well optimized for interacting with the immune receptors . \n\n the rmsd

the proteins , we decided to perform rmsf ( root mean square fluctuation ) analysis . in this analysis , the average value of fluctuation of each residue during the simulation is plotted , figure 8 . as it is shown in figure 8a , the rmsf values of nom recombinant protein in five simulations indicate that the fluctuation of the monomer form of the vaccine in many regions is considerably more than the complex forms . this is a direct indication that the nom recombinant protein is much more stable when it is in complex with the two immune receptors . furthermore , the rmsf values of the nom recombinant protein in complex with hla-a * 11:01 are lower compared with that of nom recombinant protein in complex with tlr4 . also , with the evidence that the binding energies are also lower , we can conclude that nom recombinant protein can bind to the hla-a * 11:01 better than the other immune receptor . \n\n the rmsf values of each protein in the simulated complexes compared to the simulated monomer forms of the proteins throughout the 100 ns of production runs . a , the comparison of the rmsf values of nom recombinant protein in the complexes with the monomer form . b , the

the graphical illustration of the monomer forms and the complex forms of the nom recombinant protein and the hla-a * 11:01 and tlr4 immune receptors . \n\n in figure 8b and figure 8c , the rmsf values of the monomer forms of the immune receptors show lower values compared to the complex forms . this behavior is exactly the opposite of the nom designed protein . this can be an indication that the structures are very stable in their natural function and their structures considerably change when they get into contact with the designed nom protein . furthermore , the structural illustration of the monomer forms and also the complex forms of the vaccine and the immune receptors , figure 9 , shows that the vaccine can fill the cavities and bind tightly to them , as it was proved by the binding energies . \n\n conclusion \n\n covid-19 pandemic is much more than a health crisis . it leads to a political , social and economic crisis in the world . the development of a safe and effective vaccine could reduce the rate of this infection . immunoinformatics methods are valuable in reducing time and cost in vaccine design and other fields of life sciences . we have predicted and validated nom recombinant protein against hla-a * 11:01 and tlr4 receptors . our evaluation was based on vaccine candidate structural analysis and molecular docking and md simulations study . the nom-tlr4 and nom-hla-a * 11:01 complexes were very stable in their natural function with strong molecular interactions in around 100 ns . higher binding energy even after the md simulation of 100 ns confirmed the stability and specificity nom-tlr4 and nom- hla-a * 11:01 interaction . our vaccine candidate can stimulate both cellular and humoral immunity , given that b and t-cell epitopes have been selected in the final construct . taken all together , according to physicochemical evaluations as well as structural and immunological analyses , nom recombinant protein could be considered as a possible vaccine candidate against covid-19 . \n\n acknowledgements \n\n this work was supported by the hormozgan university of medical sciences under grant [ number : hums-rec.1398.647 ] , bandar

february , 2020 , china has 70 635 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , including 1772 deaths [ 1 ] . human-to-human spread of the virus via respiratory droplets is currently considered to be the main route of transmission . however , exhaled air dispersion during non-invasive respiratory support may increase the risk of coronavirus transmission , and requires more attention from medical personnel and patients . \n\n non-invasive respiratory support plays an essential role in the treatment of covid-19 . more awareness is needed of viral transmission through exhaled air . http : //bit.ly/39knrrf \n\n to the editor : \n\n as of 17 february , 2020 , china has 70 635 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , including 1772 deaths . human-to-human spread of the virus via respiratory droplets is currently considered to be the main route of transmission . however , exhaled air dispersion during non-invasive respiratory support may increase the risk of coronavirus transmission , and requires more attention from medical personnel and patients . \n\n according to the chinese centre for disease control and prevention , among 72 314 reported cases in mainland china ( 44 672 confirmed cases , 16 186 suspected cases , 10 567 clinically diagnosed cases , and 889 asymptomatic infected cases ) as of 11 february , 1716 medical staff were infected . notably , wang et al . analysed the clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalised cases with covid-19 and found that the nosocomial infection rate in the study was about 41.3 % , with 17 inpatients and 40 medical staff . given the high use of respiratory support to treat dyspnoea and respiratory failure induced by covid-19 , viral transmission through exhaled air should be considered . \n\n when oxygen is delivered through nasal catheter , mask or non-invasive ventilation ( niv ) , substantial exhaled air is released into the air , which can increase dispersion of the virus , and subsequently increase the risk of nosocomial infection . prior studies have suggested that the application of high-flow nasal cannula ( hfnc ) , niv through the specific mask with optimised vent holes or the helmet with a double-limb circuit may lower the risk of airborne transmission . performing non-invasive respiratory support in a single , well-ventilated , negative pressure ward is also considered a safe option . currently , however , the majority of patients are still receiving respiratory support through nasal catheter or common mask in general wards or emergency departments with limited medical resources . the potential for airborne transmission in this population has not received enough attention . furthermore , a significant proportion of suspected patients with mild to no symptoms who are managing at home may also require long-term home oxygen or niv treatment ( e.g . patients with advanced staged copd ) . these patients may increase the risk of family cluster infections by the widespread dispersion of exhaled air in their homes . \n\n non-invasive respiratory support plays an essential role in the treatment of covid-19 , and more awareness is needed regarding the increased risk of viral transmission from exhaled air . medical staff should utilise personal protective equipment when providing respiratory support therapy . patients should wear a medical mask when receiving conventional oxygen therapy or hfnc in order to reduce air dispersion . when performing niv therapy , because helmet resources are limited and they are not frequently used in routine clinical practice , we suggest avoiding masks with vent holes and adding a filter between the mask and the vent valve to reduce viral transmission . patient beds should be at least 1 m from one another and the ward air circulation rate needs to be increased . for patients with suspected covid-19 infection receiving long-term respiratory support at home , it is recommended that they stay in a single , well-ventilated room to avoid potentially infecting their family members . \n\n shareable pdf \n\n conflict of interest : l. guan has nothing to disclose .

00010010	early in the epidemic : impact of preprints on global discourse about covid-19 transmissibility \n\n since it was first reported by who in jan 5 , 2020 , over 80 000 cases of a novel coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) have been diagnosed in china , with exportation events to nearly 90 countries , as of march 6 , 2020 . given the novelty of the causative pathogen ( named sars-cov-2 ) , scientists have rushed to fill epidemiological , virological , and clinical knowledge gaps : resulting in over 50 new studies about the virus between january 10 and january 30 alone . however , in an era where the immediacy of information has become an expectation of decision makers and the general public alike , many of these studies have been shared first in the form of preprint papers : before peer review . \n\n for the past three decades , preprint servers have become commonplace in the scientific publication ecosystem , and covid-19 has prompted a seemingly unprecedented use of these platforms . although peer-review is crucial for the validation of science , the ongoing outbreak has showcased the speed with which preprints can disseminate information during emergencies . in this comment , we used both preprint and peer-reviewed studies that estimated the transmissibility potential ( ie , basic reproduction number [ r 0 ] ) of sars-cov-2 on or before feb 1 , 2020 to investigate the role that preprints have had in information dissemination during the ongoing outbreak . we also analysed the agreement of preprint estimates compared with those presented by peer-reviewed studies and propose a consensus-based approach for evaluating the validity of preprint findings during public health crises . for our analysis , we collected publicly available data from scientific studies , news reports , and search trends pertaining to sars-cov-2 and its r 0 . defined as the average number of secondary infections that a new case might transmit in a fully susceptible population , estimates of r 0 can provide decision makers with insights into the epidemic potential of a given outbreak . \n\n relevant news reports were discovered through mediacloud and search trends by use of google search trends , and both served as a proxy indicator for information dissemination . meanwhile , relevant scientific studies were discovered through a combination of searches executed with use of google scholar and , to address possible delays in indexing , four popular public preprint servers ( ie , arxiv , biorxiv , medrxiv , and social science research network [ ssrn ] ) that we believe are representative of the relevant preprint literature . search terms and specifications for each data source are outlined in the appendix ( p 2 ) . all studies discovered through google scholar , arxiv , biorxiv , medrxiv , and ssrn were manually checked for relevance to the topic area of interest . we retained only studies that included estimates for the r 0 associated with sars-cov-2 in the body of the text . \n\n r0 mean and range estimates from 11 different studies of covid-19 as a function of time \n\n for preprints that were revised before publication of the first relevant peer-reviewed study on jan 29 , the version number is indicated between parentheses as ( n ) . when multiple r0 estimates were presented in a single study because of the use of multiple approaches , the version number is followed by a single decimal place to indicate the approach used ( n.n ) . if a first author published more than one relevant independent study before feb 1 , the version number is followed immediately by an alphabetical marker ordered by date of publication ( nx ) . ranges presented vary by study ( eg , 95 % ci , 95 % credible interval , and so on ) and are presented in the appendix ( p 3 ) . r0=basic reproduction number . \n\n after this initial data discovery phase , which yielded 11 individual studies , date of first publication , publication platform , review status ( ie , preprint vs peer-reviewed ) , and methodological details were manually curated from each study ( appendix p 3 ) . r 0 estimates were also extracted from each study for further analysis . in the event of multiple r 0 estimates : because of preprint revisions after the first version or the use of multiple approaches in a single study : each estimate was recorded and treated as a separate entry to represent all available knowledge at any given point in time ( appendix p 3 ) . given that the first known preprint estimates for r 0 were posted to ssrn by us on jan 23 , we plotted search trend fractions and news report volume between jan 23 and feb 1 ( appendix p 4 ) . baseline data for both sources before jan 23 , 2020 , yielded negligible search trend interest and news report volume , and data collected up to feb 9 , 2020 , showed diminishing interest and volume after the catchment window ( appendix p 4 ) . to illustrate when each of the 11 relevant studies became available to the public , indicator bars were overlaid against the search trend and news report data by date of publication ( appendix p 4 ) . we then plotted each of the 16 r 0 estimates produced by the 11 studies , including both the mean and the estimate range ( eg , 95 % ci , 95 % credible interval , and so on ) presented ( appendix p 3 ) . estimates were plotted by date of publication and alphabetically there-in , offering a side-by-side comparison of preprint versus peer-reviewed results ; averages and 95 % cis were also computed for both groups ( figure ) . \n\n google search trends and mediacloud data suggested that both general ( ie , search ) interest and news media interest in the r 0 associated with covid-19 peaked before the publication of relevant peer-reviewed studies during the early stages of the epidemic . in the selected time frame , search interest peaked on jan 27 after a sharp increase between jan 23 and jan 25 immediately after the publication of five early preprint studies : all of which estimated r 0 : in biorxiv , medrxiv , and ssrn . meanwhile , news media interest peaked on jan 28 , coinciding with a sixth preprint study published in arxiv ( appendix p 4 ) . the first peer-reviewed estimates were then published by li and colleagues in the new england journal of medicine on jan 29 at 17:00 h ( eastern standard time ) , followed by four additional peer-reviewed studies in eurosurveillance , the international journal of infectious diseases , the lancet , and journal of clinical medicine up to feb 1 . average r 0 estimates across the preprint group were 3 61 ( 95 % ci 2 77-4 45 ) and 2 54 ( 2 17-2 91 ) across the peer-reviewed group : showing overlap in 95 % cis despite a wide diversity of modelling methods and data sources used both in-group and across-group ( appendix p 3 ) . although the average mean for the preprint group was higher than that for the peer-reviewed group , this effect was driven primarily by two upper-limit outlier estimates ( with r 0 higher than the 95 % ci maximum ; figure ) . exclusion of these two estimates by use of a consensus-based approach based on the 95 % cis yielded an average r 0 estimate of 3 02 ( 95 % ci 2 65-3 39 ) for the preprint group . notably , two studies in the peer-reviewed group had previously been published as preprints . although estimates presented by riou and althaus remained unchanged after peer review , estimates presented by zhao and colleagues were higher before peer review than afterwards . \n\n our findings suggest that , because of the speed of their release , preprints : rather than peer-reviewed literature in the same topic area : might be driving discourse related to the ongoing covid-19 outbreak . although our analysis focused on search trends and news media data as a measure for general discourse , it is likely that preprints are also influencing policy making discussions , given that who announced on jan 26 , 2020 , that they would be creating a repository of relevant studies : including those that have not yet been peer-reviewed . \n\n nevertheless , despite the advantages of speedy information delivery , the lack of peer review can also translate into issues of credibility and misinformation , both intentional and unintentional . this particular drawback has been highlighted during the ongoing outbreak , especially after the high-profile withdrawal of a virology study from the preprint server biorxiv , which erroneously claimed that covid-19 contained hiv `` insertions '' . the very fact that this study was withdrawn showcases the power of open peer-review during emergencies ; the withdrawal itself appears to have been prompted by outcry from dozens of scientists from around the globe who had access to the study because it was placed on a public server . much of this outcry was documented on twitter ( a microblogging platform ) and on longer-form popular science blogs , signalling that such fora would serve as rich additional data sources for future work on the impact of preprints on public discourse . however , instances such as this one described showcase the need for caution when acting upon the science put forth by any one preprint . \n\n with this in mind , taking multiple studies into consideration as presented in our analysis can help operationalise the kind of caution necessitated by preprints while simultaneously allowing for important , robust insights before the publication of a peer-reviewed study in the same topic area . here , we used a simple method in which we plotted the ten r 0 estimates that were posted as preprints before publication of the first peer-reviewed study on jan 29 ; we then took the average of these estimates and excluded the two estimates that qualified as upper-limit outliers : both upon visual inspection and as a function of the 95 % ci . even before outlier elimination , this simple method yielded average r 0 estimates similar to those presented by the peer-reviewed studies subsequently published on and after jan 29 ; however , more complex approaches that incorporate weighted averages based on estimate confidence , similar to traditional meta-analytical methods , offer a promising avenue for future work . such collective , consensus-based approaches will arguably be easiest to use when the research of interest is quantitative in nature ; nevertheless , given that many crucial epidemiological parameters that inform decision making ( eg , incubation period , generation time , and so on ) are quantitative , our proposed approach could work well in these contexts as well . \n\n our work showcases the powerful role preprints can have during public health crises because of the timeliness with which they can disseminate new information . furthermore , given that two of the preprints included in this analysis were later published in peer-reviewed outlets , the evidence shows that that even prestigious journals now permit the sharing of important findings before peer review and that the use of preprint platforms does not jeopardise future peer-reviewed publication . without question , primacy and peer-reviewed publications are key metrics in individual professional advancement ( eg , academic promotion ) ; nevertheless , the impact of preprints on discourse and decision making pertaining to the ongoing covid-19 outbreak suggests that we must rethink how we reward and recognise community contributions during present and future public health crises . \n\n references \n\n\n\n

10000000	clinical progression of covid-19 patient with extended incubation period , delayed rt-pcr time-to-positivity , and potential role of chest ct-scan . \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , previously called 2019-ncov , is a novel disease caused by sars- cov-2 which was first identified as outbreak of unknown respiratory illness in wuhan , china . covid- 19 was declared as global health emergency by who on march 11 , 2020 and quickly elevated to global pandemic on 11 march 2020 . covid-19 symptom is highly various in each patient , with fever , fatigue , shortness of breath , and cough as the main presenting symptoms . patient with covid-19 may shows severe symptom with severe pneumonia and ards , mild symptom resembling simple upper respiration tract infection , or even completely asymptomatic . approximately 80 % of cases is mild . however the number may changes as more people are getting tested . some experts are estimating that up to 50 % of all cases may be asymptomatic carrier . 
01100000	potential cytoprotective activity of ozone therapy in sars-cov-2/covid-19 . \n\n ( 1 ) background : the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) disease ( covid-19 ) in china at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak . systemic ozone therapy ( ot ) could be potentially useful in the clinical management of several complications secondary to sars-cov-2 . the rationale and mechanism of action has already been proven clinically in other viral infections and has been shown in research studies to be highly effective at decreasing organ damage mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress . this review summarizes the ot studies that illustrate the possible cytoprotective mechanism of action of ozone and its physiological by-products in target organs affected by sars-cov-2 . ( 2 ) methods : this review encompasses a total of 74 peer-reviewed original articles . it is mainly focused on ozone as a modulator of the nf-kappa b/nrf2 pathways and il-6/il-1beta expression . ( 3 ) results : in experimental models and the few existent clinical studies , homeostasis of the free radical and antioxidant balance by ot was associated with a modulation of nf-kappa b/nrf2 balance and il-6 and il-1beta expression . these molecular mechanisms support the cytoprotective effects of ot against tissue damage present in many inflammatory diseases , including viral infections . ( 4 ) conclusions : the potential cytoprotective role of ot in the management of organ damage induced by covid-19 merits further research . controlled clinical trials are needed . 
01001000	perspective from ecuador , the second country with more confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in south america : a review \n\n to face the pandemic outbreak of a novel coronavirus many countries developed a series of containment methods ; however , developing countries in south america had reacted apathetically to this worldwide concern . ecuador 's response to the novel virus coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) started on february 26 , 2020 , one month after the outbreak began in china . as of today , the countries with more confirmed cases in south america are brazil and ecuador . although brazil has two times the number of cases than ecuador ( brazil : 700 cases per 100000 people vs. ecuador : 400 cases per 100000 ) , the huge population difference between the two countries raises concerns about the public health policies implemented by the ecuadorian government . even though there is no cure for covid-19 , chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are promising alternatives . the covid-19 pandemic outbreak has shown that there is room for improvement in the healthcare systems worldwide and the disastrous results on the fragile often unprepared are those systems in developing countries . \n\n introduction and background \n\n alarm bells over the world started to ring after the news regarding a case of pneumonia caused by a novel virus in wuhan , china . the virus supposedly originated in one of the largest markets in wuhan . on january 7 , 2020 , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) isolated the virus and called it severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) . the disease caused by this virus was named coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) by the world health organization ( who ) . \n\n even though the majority of cases present with flu-like symptoms , 3.4 % of patients develop severe pneumonia , septic shock , respiratory failure , and multiorgan failure leading to a fatal outcome . \n\n on january 30 , 2020 , the who declared the covid-19 outbreak a global health emergency . countries applied many measures , hoping to contain the spread of the disease ; for example , restricting mobility and quarantines . additionally , incoming flights from countries with a high prevalence of the disease were suspended , first from china and then followed by italy and spain . \n\n in south america , brazil is the country with the highest number of covid-19-confirmed cases followed by ecuador . although brazil has two times the number of cases than ecuador , it is important to analyze the prevalence of the disease in the context of the countries ' population . while brazil , with a population of 212,559,417 , has a total of 1,549 confirmed cases ( 0.007 % ) ; ecuador , with a population of 17,567,751 , has 789 confirmed cases ( 0.004 % ) . the greater ratio of cases per population in ecuador raises the concern about the efficacy of the containment measures and public health policies taken by the country . \n\n the limitations of the healthcare systems in developing countries increase their chances of being affected more during a pandemic outbreak . \n\n review \n\n confirmed cases and ecuadorian response \n\n after the announcement that covid-19 was spreading rapidly across asian countries , european countries went into an alarm state and started to design containment measures while south american countries reacted apathetically , delaying decisions on preventive measures , underestimating the severity of the events . \n\n ecuador 's response to the novel virus covid-19 started on february 26 , 2020 . the set of measures included monitoring the temperature and other covid-19-related symptoms in travelers from high-risk countries . on february 29 , 2020 , ecuador confirmed the first case of covid-19 . the patient had arrived from spain two weeks before the diagnosis was made . \n\n after the who declared covid-19 as a pandemic outbreak on march 11 , 2020 , ecuador declared a national health emergency . all non-essential activities were suspended indefinitely and the use of virtual platforms was encouraged for academic activities , jobs , and medical care . as did other countries did , ecuador also closed its land , air , and sea borders to citizens and non-citizens for 21 days . restrictions to vehicular or pedestrian traffic and a national curfew from 7 pm to 5 am also took place . \n\n despite these measures , the virus continued spreading across the ecuadorian provinces . on march 23 , 2020 , 789 confirmed patients with covid-19 and 18 deaths related to the virus were reported by the ministry of health of ecuador . the mortality rate was similar to other countries . the number of confirmed patients increased , so did the number of people in epidemiological monitoring and quarantine . \n\n the infection risk in physicians also increases in countries with a high prevalence of sars-cov-2 . in italy , more than 3,000 health providers were infected becoming an increasing concern among health providers worldwide . in ecuador , 24 doctors have been tested positive for the virus one month after the first patient 's admission with covid-19 . the rising number of physicians testing positive for covid-19 raises concern amid a growing outcry over the shortage of protective equipment and medical supplies . \n\n guayas , with 607 confirmed cases , is by far the most affected province by covid-19 in ecuador . measures applied in the rest of the country with relative success failed in this province . the out-of-control increase in confirmed cases poses the risk of collapsing the health care system there . this situation led the government to declare the province as a national security zone , leaving operational planning to the army . \n\n transmission \n\n the transmission was described as animal-to-person in affected patients at the huanan seafood wholesale market of wuhan . at the moment , person-to-person transmission and fomite transmission have been linked with the spread of the illness . li compiled information on the dynamics of the novel virus , estimating a transmission rate of r0 2.2 for covid-19 . in addition , cascella mentions that close contact with an infected person is needed to transmit the virus . therefore , relatives and health professionals are at greater risk . \n\n there are some discrepancies about the transmission . while some studies support the animal-to-human transmission , including a case of a pet that tested positive for covid-19 , the cdc states that there is no evidence that pets can transmit the virus or present the symptomology of infection . \n\n prevention \n\n the main goal in the control of a pandemic outbreak is to achieve r0 less than 1 ( one positive patient can infect less than one extra person ) . to reach this goal , prevention is paramount . \n\n the who and cdc recommend avoiding contact with symptomatic people and agglomerations . basic hygiene practices , such as constant hand washing and the use of face masks in symptomatic patients , are also recommended to prevent the spread of the virus . \n\n many countries utilized quarantine and mobilization restrictions to control the spread ; however , these measures may not be sufficient in developing countries such as ecuador . \n\n pathophysiology \n\n the cause of covid-19 is a ribonucleic acid ( rna ) virus of the coronaviridae family called sars-cov-2 . although the exact pathophysiology of sars-cov-2 is unknown , its structural similarity with other viruses of the coronaviridae family allows an understanding of its dynamics and the evolution of the disease . the clinical presentation may vary from flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia similar to sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n channappanavar and granlinski mention that the most aggressive strains of the coronavirinae family , like sars-cov , have protein e in their envelope that stimulates nf-kb , a protein complex involved in cellular responses , including stress , cytokine signaling , response to viral infections , and apoptosis . protein e , along with other proteins , interferes with the host immune response ( tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) alpha and interleukin 6 ( il-6 ) ) . these processes produce uncontrolled inflammation , resulting in lung edema and fibrosis . \n\n treatment \n\n efforts to control covid-19 had been made by many countries , starting with investigations to develop a vaccine from the attenuated or inactive virus . the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases announced the beginning of the first trial on 45 volunteers between 18 and 55 years old . this first phase is estimated to last for six weeks . the kaiser research institute is evaluating the feasibility of the mrna-1723 vaccine . \n\n the management of patients with acute respiratory syndrome consists of assisted oxygen ventilation to achieve a saturation percentage of oxygen ( spo2 ) of 90 % and antipyretics . \n\n multiple drugs are being studied to treat covid-19 , with promising results . in the united states and china , a randomized clinical trial has been initiated to test the efficacy of remdesivir . at the moment , oseltamivir , a neuraminidase inhibitor , has been used more extensively . \n\n chloroquine , a drug used worldwide , has a promising effect in the treatment of severe pneumonia by covid-19 at a dose of 500 mg2 times a day ; however , zhou questions its use due to its side effects . instead of using chloroquine , zhou suggests hydroxychloroquine as an alternative treatment . hydroxychloroquine seems to attenuate the progression to more severe scenarios of covd-19 infection , although its dosage still needs further study . \n\n conclusions \n\n the low mortality of covid-19 may be the reason for developing countries underestimating the magnitude of this pandemic outbreak . the health care systems risk collapsing due to the increasing number of confirmed patients who need intensive care and the spread of the disease in health providers . the high demand for financial and human resources by this disease leads to a collateral increase in mortality from other causes . the covid-19 pandemic outbreak has shown that there is still room for improvement in healthcare systems worldwide to prevent its catastrophic impact , especially on the fragile and often unprepared systems in developing countries . \n\n the authors have declared that no competing interests exist . \n\n references \n\n cnn . ? cual es la tasa de mortalidad del coronavirus ?

10000000	multistage ct features of coronavirus disease 2019 . \n\n objectives : to determine imaging features of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in different stages , and to provide foundations for early diagnosis and treatment . methods : ct image data of 187 covid-19 patients were analyzed in the period of hospitalization . ct scanning was performed on admission and repeated every 3 days . the improvement time of clinical symptoms and the image changes of follow-up ct were statistically analyzed . results : all 187 patients ' nucleic acid test were positive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) . the early ct images of lung in 187 cases ( 100 % ) showed multiple patchy and ground-glass opacities with fine mesh and consolidation shade , which mainly distributed in pulmonary band or under the pleura . in the progressive stage , the pulmonary lesions in 146 cases ( 78.1 % ) were mainly consolidation , accompanied by air bronchogram , thickening of blood vessels , and interstitial changes . severe pulmonary ct images in 15 cases ( 8 % ) showed diffuse lesions in both lungs , displaying consolidation , or `` white lung '' . the ct imaging features in 185 cases ( 98.9 % ) at the absorptive period showed that the lesions diminished and fibrogenesis . the imaging features of 6 times of lung ct examination in one case showed continuous progress . the original lesion in one case was obviously absorbed , but new lesions appeared under the pleura of both lungs at the third review of ct scanning . the changes of ct imaging lesions during follow-up were significantly different in different clinical symptoms improvement time ( p < 0.01 ) . conclusions : images of covid-19 in various stages have special characteristics . the change of clinical symptoms is synchronous with the change of reexamination ct . follow-up ct can reflect the trend of clinical changes . repeat ct examination plays an important role in the early clinical diagnosis and the evaluation for the therapeutic effect on covid-19 patient . 
00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region

causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the

00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a

00001000	role of mask/respirator protection against sars-cov-2 \n\n to the editor \n\n since its outbreak on december 31 , 2019 , in wuhan , a central city in china , coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) has now spread to almost all countries in the world . it has been declared a pandemic , and it has infected over 1,041,126 people in a very short time , with 55,132 deaths as ofapril 3 , 2020 . wearing masks/respirators and practicingself-isolation at home have been recommended as guidelines for thepublic . however , the problem is the number of cases among medical personnel . interestingly , a higher risk of infection was noticed in male professionals . there are currently many types of masks/respirators available , ranging from simple surgical masks designed to protect wearers from microorganism transmission and fit loosely to the user 's face , through n95 masks used to prevent users from inhaling small airborne particles . these must fit tightly to the user 's face . masks differ primarily in their maximum internal leakage rate limit . surgical masks are designed to protect against droplets or particles with a diameter of > 100 mum , whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) virus is essentially spherical , albeit slightly pleomorphic , with a diameter of 60-140 nm and 100 times smaller than the pore diameter . thus , surgical masks can not prevent inhalation of small airborne particles ; however , both can protect users from large droplets and sprays . the pn-en 149:2001 standard defines 3 protection classes for half masks : filtering face piece 1 ( ffp1 ) , filtering face piece 2 ( ffp2 ) , and filtering face piece 3 ( ffp3 ) . the maximum internal leakage limit is 25 % for ffp1 , 11 % for ffp2 , and 5 % for ffp3 . class ffp1 masks retain about 80 % of particles smaller than 2 mum , ffp2 ones retain 94 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum , and ffp3 ones retain 99.95 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum ( table ) . \n\n test ffp1 ffp2 ffp3 concentration of harmful substances till 4 x nds till 10 x nds till 30 x nds leakage < 22 % < 8 % < 2 % penetration < 20 % < 6 % < 1 % initial expiration resistance at 95 l/min < 210 pa < 240 pa < 300 pa \n\n filtration efficiency for each class of masks \n\n abbreviations : ffp1 , filtering face piece 1 ; ffp2 , filtering face piece 2 ; ffp3 , filtering face piece 3 ; nds , the highest acceptable concentration of the harmful factor . \n\n at the moment , we may meet divergent recommendations for the use of masks . while the centers for disease control and prevention recommend the use of masks in low-risk and high-risk situations , the world health organization advises applying masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations . long et al conclude in their meta-analysis that the use of n95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza . they suggest that n95 respirators should not be recommended for the general public and non-high-risk medical staff who are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients . \n\n the potential of face masks to reduce the spread of respiratory infections could be useful . wang et al indicated that 10 of 213 medical professionals with no mask were infected by covid-19 as compared with 0 of 278 wearing n95 respirators . \n\n it is also worth noting that the respirator increases resistance to inhalation . the longer they are used , the more difficult breathing becomes because of more absorbed dust . what is more , the effectiveness decreases with the increase of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the respirator and face ( the so-called dead space ) . the concentration of carbon dioxide in the dead space increases with each subsequent exhalation . therefore , masks should be replaced frequently . additionally , to improve the comfort of use , masks use 1-way exhalation valves , which accelerate the circulation of gases.6 \n\n to conclude , the use of protective masks can and should be the first protection against sars-cov-2 transmission to medical personnel . medical personnel should use class ffp3 masks . additionally , the application of visors to cover the entire face during contact with the patient is worth considering . \n\n references \n\n association between 2019-ncov transmission and n95 respirator use . \n\n comparison of performance of three different types of respiratory protection devices . \n\n protecting healthcare staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome : filtration capacity of multiple surgical masks . \n\n a close shave ? performance of p2/n95 respirators in health care workers with facial hair : results of the beards ( adequate respiratory defences ) study . \n\n effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza : a systematic review and meta-analysis . \n\n cloth masks versus medical masks for covid-19 . 
00001000	emergency trauma care during the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in china \n\n background \n\n a novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in wuhan , hubei province , in december 2019 ; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans . china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease . however , a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking . to regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak , we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in wuhan . \n\n main body \n\n the article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 , indications for emergency surgery , and infection prevention and control for medical personnel , providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period . \n\n conclusions \n\n the measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of covid-19 . \n\n background \n\n a novel corona virus disease ( covid-19 ) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) began in wuhan , hubei province , china , in december 2019 . by february 13 , 2020 , more than 60,000 cases were confirmed , nearly 50,000 in hubei alone , and the source of the infection was yet to be definitely determined . the world health organization ( who ) has declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) . considering the current rate of human to human transmission , most countries in the world should be well prepared for the potential global covid-19 pandemic . china is on the frontline in the fight against the virus , and medical staff have become exhausted due to the excessive workload brought on by the outbreak . medical testing tools and personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , such as face shields , goggles , and gloves , have become scarce and have had to be rationed among teams and medical centers , with severe shortage in hubei , the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak . a report from a neurosurgery department of a teaching hospital in wuhan showed that from december 25 , 2019 , to february 6 , 2020 , eight covid-19 suspected patients were admitted , and three were confirmed . consequently , 12 medical personnel were infected ( 11 nurses and one doctor ) , among whom three had been in close contact with the first confirmed case . according to the data released by the national health commission ( nhc ) of the people 's republic of china , a total of 1716 medical personnel infections had been reported nationwide , accounting for 3.8 % of the total confirmed cases by 24:00 on february 11 , 2020 , of which six ( 0.4 % ) had died . of these , hubei province reported 1502 cases , accounting for 87.5 % of the total medical personnel infections , while wuhan city reported 1102 cases , accounting for 73.4 % . notably , medical personnel are the most valuable resource during the outbreak . how to protect them from infection is one of the foremost challenges in the fight against sars-cov-2 . \n\n although china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of sars-cov-2 , severe trauma can still occur . during the outbreak , the population of trauma patients may be diverse in terms of infection status , including patients who were previously healthy , suspected to be infected , confirmed infected , close contacts of infected individuals , and asymptomatic carriers . thus , balancing optimal trauma care while preventing further spread of the viral infection during the outbreak is a major challenge . \n\n to our knowledge , there is no relevant consensus or clinical guideline available on the indications of , timing of or perioperative protection during emergency surgery for trauma . to protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of trauma care , we have summarized the recommended perioperative infection prevention and control measures for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 based on current practical experience in china and the published literature on surgical practice during the past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) , ebola virus , and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n main text \n\n general principles \n\n special requirements for the hospitals receiving trauma patients during the outbreak \n\n emergency department : set up a triage area for assessment of all patients at admission , allowing early recognition of possible sars-cov-2 infection and immediate isolation of patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection in an area separate from other patients . \n\n radiology department : a dedicated ct room should be kept on standby for the examination of infected patients . \n\n operating room ( or ) : a relatively isolated negative-pressure or is preferable ; if there is no permanent negative-pressure or , a temporarily modified negative-pressure or the main operating suite of the hospital can be converted . \n\n intensive care unit ( icu ) : an isolated area should be prepared in the icu , and suspected patients should be treated in a single space . \n\n intrahospital transport : although an ideal trauma center with a door-to-door ct room and negative-pressure or are preferable in this situation , most regions in china do not operate such facilities . therefore , a predetermined transport route should be used to minimize exposure , and any intrahospital transport should utilize dedicated carts demarcated by a warning logo equipped with protective supplies and hand disinfectants . the patient should wear a medical mask , and the walls and the floor of the passageways and the elevator should be covered with a plastic lining . \n\n to control the spread of covid-19 , basic principles for treating infectious diseases should be followed , and necessary measures should be taken before receiving trauma patients . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n precaution level applicable personnel and scenarios personal protective equipment level 1 triage , emergency department clean non-sterile long gown , disposable head cover , disposable medical mask , and gloves . level 2 close contact with suspected patients , or handling secretions , feces , and personal items belonging to patients ; performing ct scan ( fig . 1 ) disposable head cover , gloves , disposable coverall , n95 respirator or equivalent , goggle or face shield , rubber boots or fluid-resistant overshoes , etc . level 3 close contact with suspected patients , or collecting blood , respiratory tract samples of patients , especially for endotracheal intubation , airway care , and sputum suction , as well as emergency surgery ( fig . 2 ) . on the basis of wearing secondary protective equipment such as goggle or face shield , other protective equipment should be strengthened . for instance , adding disposable surgical clothing and gloves in addition to disposable coverall and gloves . two layers of gloves covering protective clothing and surgical clothes sleeves , respectively , use of a powered air purifying respirator ( papr ) . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n to standardize and simplify the precaution measures and equipment required for different personnel and scenarios in trauma care , we adopted a three-level precaution protocol in trauma care ( table 1 ) . \n\n all levels of precaution were based on implementing standard precautions , including hand hygiene , respiratory hygiene , and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment ( ppe ) according to different risk levels . proper training of the standard donning and doffing procedures is the basis of effective protection . in epidemic areas such as hubei province , all patients can be regarded as potentially suspected patients during the outbreak , and the level of the precaution should be elevated . \n\n triage \n\n classification of the patients suspected cases clinical confirmed cases ( hubei only ) pathogenic confirmed cases diagnostic basis outside hubei province : two of the clinical manifestations with at least one of the epidemiological histories , three of the clinical manifestations without epidemiological history suspected patient in hubei province with ct findings of pneumonia suspected or clinically confirmed patients with at least one pathogenic evidence epidemiological investigation 1 . travel to or residence in wuhan in the 14 days prior to symptom onset ; 2 . close contactb with sars-cov-2 infection ( rrt-pcr positive ) within 14 days before onset ; 3 . exposed to patients from wuhan and surrounding areas , or from a community with patients who reported fever or respiratory symptoms14 d before onset ; 4 . clustering outbreak . - - clinical manifestations and ct scan 1 . fever and/or respiratory symptoms ; 2 . imaging characteristics of covid-19 ( ct : multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes in early stage , which are obvious in the peripheral lung , and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs , and lung consolidation may occur in severe cases ) ; 3 . the total number of white blood cells in the early stage is normal or decreased , and the lymphocyte count is decreased - - pathogenic evidence null null 1 . detection of sars-cov-2 in respiratory specimens and sera by rrt-pcr assays ; 2 . by virus dna sequencing , respiratory or blood samples dna sequence highly homologous with sars-cov-2 . \n\n diagnostic criteria of covid-19a \n\n covid-19 coronavirus induced disease , sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 , rrt-pcr real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \n\n athe diagnostic criteria were defined according to guidance for the diagnosis and management for covid-19 ( 5th edition ) released by national health commission of people 's republic of china in feb. 4 , 2020 \n\n bclose contact is defined as follows : \n\n - healthcare-associated exposure , including providing direct care for covid-19 patients , working with healthcare workers infected with novel coronavirus , visiting patients , or staying in the same close environment as a covid-19 patient \n\n - working together in close proximity or sharing the same classroom environment with a covid-19 patient \n\n - traveling together with a covid-19 patient in any kind of conveyance \n\n - living in the same household as a covid-19 patient \n\n trauma patients during the outbreak should be managed using the relevant contents in table 2 , and they should complete a brief epidemiological investigation at the triage stage . however , the trauma patients ' history may be unreliable , as they may not have time to be detailed . more emphasis should be placed on the objective data . during the outbreak in wuhan , a total of 32 emergency operations were performed in a tertiary care hospital , including 19 suspected and seven pathogenic confirmed cases . in addition , nine covid-19 patients in another tertiary care hospital underwent gastrointestinal surgery , but in all of these patients , covid-19 was diagnosed postoperatively . it is worth noting that there have been many cases of asymptomatic patients with an incubation period . the maximum incubation period was reported to be 24 days . \n\n evaluation \n\n trauma care is highly time dependent and requires rapid and effective evaluation and management . during the outbreak , primary and secondary surveys should be completed while maintaining the premise of effective protection . \n\n general principles of evaluation \n\n dynamic evaluation strategies should be conducted throughout the trauma care process . the personal protective equipment ( ppe ) worn by medical personnel may result in limited or incomplete physical examinations ( such as palpation and auscultation ) . therefore , injury assessment may rely on radiological examinations . \n\n radiology evaluation \n\n a chest ct scan is recommended for all severe trauma patients if there is no contraindication . if the chest ct scan is not possible due to critical condition , the patient should be treated as a suspect for infection until infection is excluded . \n\n level 3 ppe during ct examination \n\n if the hospital has a trauma resuscitation unit , complete x-ray including but not limited to the chest and focused assessment with sonography for trauma ( fast ) in the trauma resuscitation unit should be performed . for hemodynamic stabilization , a ct scan including but not limited to the chest should be performed ( fig . 1 ) . if the hospital does not have a trauma resuscitation unit , patients with hemodynamic instability should be resuscitated in the emergency department and undergo fast simultaneously . once the hemodynamic status is stable enough , the ct scan should be performed as soon as possible . \n\n ct scan protocol for trauma patients suspected of having covid-19 : medical personnel should first determine the method and scope of the scan , including but not limited to the chest , according to the mechanism of injury . for stab wounds , the segment and body cavity near the wound should be examined . for gunshot wounds , due to the high kinetic energy of the projectiles , the tortuous wound path , and the heavy tissue damage , the scanning range should be expanded appropriately . patients who have sustained blunt injuries with high energy , such as traffic injuries , should usually be scanned with enhanced scanning ranging from head to mid-thigh ( including the whole lower limb when there is lower limb injury ) . enhanced scanning is helpful in providing further information on organ injury , and three-dimensional reconstruction of blood vessels and bone should be performed when major vascular and bone injury is suspected . \n\n ct features of covid-19 : it should be noted that the pulmonary imaging changes of covid-19 vary depending on the patient 's age , immunity status , stage of disease at the time of the scan , underlying disease , and drug intervention . reports have shown that in the early stage of infection , ct shows multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes , which are obvious in the peripheral lung and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs . in severe cases , lung consolidation could occur . in addition , special attention should be paid to discerning between covid-19 infection and pulmonary contusion . \n\n blood and pathogen specimen collection \n\n if possible , nasopharyngeal swabs , sputum , lower respiratory tract secretions , and blood samples should be collected and sent for rrt-pcr in the emergency period . if no respiratory tract specimens are collected before the operation due to time constraints , they can be collected during or after the operation . \n\n all specimens shall be deemed to be potentially infectious . collection , transportation , and processing of any clinical specimens should be performed by biological safety training qualified medical staff . level 3 precautions should be adopted to minimize the possibility of exposure . \n\n the results of rrt-pcr may be falsely negative due to the influence of sampling , transportation , extraction , and testing . recent observations have shown that 30 to 40 % of patients with covid-19 ct features were rrt-pcr negative . as a result , the protection standard can not be lowered due to negative results . since the rrt-pcr test can take several hours to confirm the diagnosis , chest ct is recommended as the basis for the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 in suspected patients , especially in areas with a high incidence of the disease . the use of chest ct not only helps to control the spread of the epidemic but can also ensure definitive care for trauma injuries in a timely manner . \n\n emergency surgery \n\n emergency surgery is of great importance for severe trauma patients , the aim of which includes hemorrhage control , contamination abatement , and compartment pressure relief as soon as possible . effective prevention of sars-cov-2 transmission by standard intraoperative protective measures is an important indicator of a successful operation . from the available evidence , sars-cov-2 is spread mainly through respiratory droplets and contact , while aerosol and fecal-oral transmission are still under investigation . from the existing evidence and our practical experience , all medical staff should adopt level 3 precautions when entering the or . \n\n or preparation \n\n an independent negative pressure operation room is the first choice . operations can only be performed when the pressure is between - 10 and - 5 pa . if a negative pressure or is not available , a relatively isolated or with an independent purification system is an alternative option . nevertheless , the purification system should be shut down during the operation , and a final disinfection should be performed postoperatively . as in standard trauma protocols , the more critical patient should be operated on first . if two or more suspected or confirmed infected patients arrive in the or , a 30-min disinfection is warranted before the subsequent operation . the dedicated or should be clearly marked as covid-19 exclusive . \n\n the dedicated covid-19 or should be designed with a special passage and elevator . the design should focus on shortening the outdoor distance , reducing the chance of human contact , and limiting the time spent in suspected contaminated areas . materials and equipment should only be delivered by specially assigned staff . people inside the or are not allowed to leave during the operation , and outdoor personnel should not enter without permission . surgical articles should be clearly identified , and the use of disposable items is recommended . to maintain pressure , surgical supplies ( surgical instruments , dressings , single-use consumables , high-value consumables , medications , and relevant items ) should be well prepared in advance . only unidirectional flow is permitted ( nothing should be taken out once it is entered during the operation ) . personnel movement and the frequency of door opening are strictly limited . nondisposable items should be disposed of postoperatively in strict accordance with regulations . two suction apparatuses are optimal , one of which is for exclusive use by the anesthesiologist . the negative pressure aspirator should be immediately placed on the patient 's face to minimize the spread of respiratory secretions after entering the operation room . \n\n ppe for operation personnel \n\n protective clothing for surgical personnel : a after wearing protective clothing and inner gloves , b after wearing operating clothes and outer gloves \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe donning \n\n the topic of intraoperative protection remains controversial because most surgeons have no experience performing surgery while wearing heavy and airproof contagion gowns and goggles . according to practice in china , some medical personnel wore two surgical gowns , two contagion gowns and four pairs of gloves for surgery during the covid-19 epidemic . instead of enhancing protective effects , such excessive protection can reduce the visual , auditory , and tactile sensitivity of the surgeon , thus reducing the precision of surgical operations ( fig . 2 ) . the influence of excessive protection on the surgeon mainly includes ( 1 ) difficulty breathing , ( 2 ) fog on goggles and face shields that interfere with vision , ( 3 ) constriction of visual fields , ( 4 ) loss of flexibility due to multiple layers of gloves , and ( 5 ) double or triple the duration of the operation . a practical lesson had been learned from the case of a 7-year-old girl with suspected covid-19 infection who was subjected to an urgent craniotomy due to obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a third ventricle germ cell-derived tumor . the surgical team adopted a level 3 precaution including n95 respirators or papr , and full coverage with protective gowns ( shoe covers included ) and sterile surgical gowns . consequently , an operation that would have taken 2-3 h ended up taking 10 h. possible solutions for reducing the impact of ppe on surgery include reducing the or temperature ( minimizing the formation of moisture on goggles ) and enhancing the lighting in the room to obtain better vision . all ppes are fit for single use except papr . the steps of donning and doffing should be completed under professional supervision ( fig . 3 ) . \n\n anesthesia \n\n regional nerve block is the first choice for limb surgeries . general anesthesia is recommended for neurosurgery , torso trauma , or multiple trauma with shock . \n\n attention should be paid to avoid aerosol generation caused by coughing and other causes in airway operations . intubation should be performed after rapid induction and full muscle relaxation to ensure complete disappearance of spontaneous breathing , and sputum aspiration before intubation should be avoided . remote endotracheal intubation by disposable glide scope with an assistant is recommended . awake endotracheal intubation is not recommended for patients with a difficult airway , hypoxia , or unconsciousness . if face mask or laryngeal mask ventilation is able to maintain oxygenation , multiple tools ( fiberoptic bronchoscope , glide scope , light stick , laryngeal mask ) can be used to assist endotracheal intubation after rapid induction of general anesthesia . if not , cricothyroid laryngotomy should be performed without any hesitation . rapid induction via oral intubation is recommended in cases of a possibly full stomach . mask positive pressure ventilation after administration should be avoided . no emetic measure is recommended . extra caution should be taken on when a nasogastric tube is in place . covid-19 can cause pulmonary inflammation that can induce added lung injury , restricted crystal fluid , and protective ventilation . the proper mechanical ventilation parameters include limited tidal volume ( < 8 ml/kg ) and airway pressure ( platform pressure < 30 cm h2o ) ; 5-10 cm h2o positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation ( peep ) is optional for alveoli expansion and oxygenation maintenance . permissive hypercapnia is also acceptable . \n\n surgical strategy \n\n the concept of damage control surgery should be followed to simplify the operation . it is optimal to finish an operation within 90 min , and strategies such as packing hemostasis , external fixation , and temporary abdominal closure are helpful to shorten the operation time . surgical personnel should be highly focused and closely coordinated . gentle movement is essential to avoid accidental injury and contamination caused by the spattering of blood , fluid , and bone debris . limiting rinsing and drainage of bodily fluids is another key to effectively reducing intraoperative contamination . reliable hemostasis should be maintained to prevent bleeding around the incision . excessive negative pressure suction and violent operations are prohibited . it is also suggested that electrotome use is not suitable under this scenario ; if it must be used , the power should be minimized . smoke should be quickly suctioned to avoid aerosol generation . \n\n postoperative management \n\n postoperative management of patients \n\n after the operation , the patient should be transferred to an isolation ward in the icu . the endotracheal tubes should be removed under analgesia to avoid violent coughing while the patient is stable . sputum aspiration should be performed by a closed suction system . trauma and surgery can impair the patient 's immune function . clinically , some asymptomatic covid-19 patients suffered rapid deterioration after surgery . surgeons and anesthesiologists should be aware that acute lung injury caused by covid-19 may exist preoperatively or worsen postoperatively . therefore , special attention should be paid to the monitoring of body temperature , infection , and hemodynamic index . reexamination of chest ct and rrt-pcr tests is also important . for postoperative trauma patients with fever , traumatic , or operative complications should also be considered to differentiate them from covid-19 . attention should be paid to symptomatic and etiological treatment . postoperative dyspnea and hypoxia should also be differentiated from complications such as pulmonary embolism . nutritional support and prevention of other complications ( bacterial infection , stress ulcer , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , and deep venous thrombosis ) should also be strengthened . \n\n quarantine \n\n based on current experience , if the medical personnel complete the operation successfully and comply with all the regulations without any accidental exposure , the patient does not need to be quarantined . otherwise , a 14-day medical observation is obligatory , and timely treatment is needed when any abnormalities occur . notably , some literature recommends a routine 14-day quarantine for relevant personnel involved in the operation for sars-cov-2 confirmed patients . however , extreme safety often results in severe incapacity to help patients , so a balance between safety and efficiency must be maintained . \n\n discussion \n\n the national health commission of china initially decided to temporarily call the disease novel coronavirus pneumonia or ncp . it was not until february 12 , 2020 , that the official name covid-19 was announced by the who . shortly after the who announced the disease 's official name , the virus causing it was named sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , highlighting the new virus 's similarity to the sars virus identified in 2003 . based on epidemiological data up to jan. 4 , 2020 , the estimated r0 was 2.2 ( 95 % ci , 1.4 to 3.9 ) , while the latest study surveying cases up to feb. 14 , 2020 , further calculated that the r0 of covid-19 was 3.77 . therefore , researchers estimated that in terms of infection ability , sars-cov-2 was slightly higher than the sars virus and significantly higher than the mers-cov . according to clinical characteristic analysis of sars-cov-2 infection in china , the mortality was 2.01 % out of 28,018 cases as of feb. 6 , 2020 . by human-to-human transmission , sars-cov-2 had spread rapidly from wuhan , china , to 24 other countries as of feb. 12 , 2020 . the number of cases within china and other countries is rapidly increasing , and it is estimated that for every additional 10 % decrease in transmission rate , the peak population will be reduced by 20-47 % . the cumulative number of infected cases and deaths will be reduced by 23-49 % due to comprehensive interventions . if current interventions continue , it is expected that the number of people infected will peak in early march 2020 . based on the epidemiological analysis , only 1.18 % of the patients had direct contact with wild animals , 31.30 % of the patients had been in wuhan , and 71.80 % of the patients had contact with people from wuhan . common symptoms included fever , cough , and diarrhea . a total of 76.4 % of patients had radiologic findings manifested as pneumonia , with the remaining patients exhibiting normal radiologic findings . poor clinical outcomes can be predicted by disease severity , including oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count , and chest ct manifestations . \n\n the transmission by aerosols is still under investigation . aerosols are solid , liquid , solid , and liquid granular substances suspended in the air , such as dust , smoke , fog , and microorganisms . these may be the `` flying vehicles '' for covid-19 . covid-19 aerosols are related to the increased risk of covid-19 transmission . tracheal intubation , noninvasive ventilation , tracheotomy , manual ventilation before intubation , bronchoscopy , cardiopulmonary resuscitation , sputum suction , and other airway operations , as well as the use of electrotome , suction , and drainage , all inevitably produce a large number of aerosols . when carrying out these operations , the protection and training of medical personnel should be strengthened , and preventive measures to protect against aerosols are recommended , including n95 respirators , papr , goggles or face shields , disposable fluid-resistant gowns , and limiting the number of people in the room . \n\n based on experience from the hospital in wuhan , patients with covid-19 have high mortality after surgery . as of february 14 , 2020 , 6 gastrointestinal operations were performed in the general surgery department of the authors ' hospital ; one 60-year-old male died of respiratory failure 14 days after surgery , and one died of septic shock , for a mortality rate of 33.33 % . another group of eight covid-19 confirmed patients in zhongnan hospital of wuhan university underwent gastrointestinal surgeries ( seven gastrointestinal tumors and one benign case ) ; one patient died of covid-19 after left hemicolectomy with the diagnosis of postoperative recurrence of renal cancer involving the descending colon with intestinal obstruction , and one tumor patient died from postoperative complications of abdominal infection , for a mortality rate of 25 % . trauma patients usually have massive hemorrhage , shock , and contamination . damage control strategies should be complied with to correct fatal triads caused by hypothermia , acidosis , and coagulopathy . meanwhile , effective oxygen therapy and organ function support are also indispensable . \n\n moreover , additional attention should be paid to patients in critical condition and to those who develop severe pneumonia after trauma . among covid-19 patients , critical patients , including patients with respiratory failure , septic shock , and other organ failures , have accounted for 29 % ~32 % . identifying high-risk groups with severe illness can also help reduce the occurrence of poor prognosis . the possible high-risk groups include patients over 65 years old , patients with obesity , and patients with other diseases ( such as chronic pulmonary disease , hypertension , heart disease , kidney disease , diabetes , tumor , and immune deficiency ) . \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe doffing \n\n the covid-19 outbreak poses significant challenges to hospital staff and specifically trauma surgeons , which must offer optimal and timely care despite the circumstances . strict safety protocols must be adhered to when carrying out emergency care for patients with severe trauma and other surgical diseases , which means that all the measures shall be carried out to preserve the ability of the medical staff to achieve the purpose of effective care without sacrificing the safety of all involved . the perspectives in this paper can not be a substitute for clinical judgment and expert consultation but can help provide up-to-date guidance on the clinical management of emergency surgery for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 ( fig . 4 ) . \n\n conclusion \n\n in conclusion , the covid-19 outbreak raises several issues concerning the safety of medical personnel and patients . areas with high incidence rates of covid-19 should conduct operations with caution and protection should be strengthened while ensuring suitable facilities to carry out optimal care with maximal safety . with the accumulation of clinical experience and in-depth research , some of the practices may require modification when additional high-quality evidence emerges . the above is china 's experience in treating trauma patients during the covid-19 outbreak . we hope that this report will help hospitals worldwide prepare for future covid-19 outbreaks and infection control in unexpected conditions . \n\n abbreviations \n\n covid-19 \n\n corona virus disease \n\n sars-cov-2 \n\n severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \n\n

00001000	applications of 3d printing technology to address covid-19 related supply shortages \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) was first identified in an outbreak in wuhan , china on december 8 , 2019 . globally , the number of affected covid-19 patients is growing exponentially , with the death toll exceeding 27,300 as of march 27 , 2020 . worldwide , there is a limited supply of n95 respirator masks , face shields , ventilator valves , testing kits and other personal protective equipment . thus , adequate production and distribution of personal protective equipment is critical during this pandemic . to address these shortages , three-dimensional ( 3d ) printing , a novel and innovative technology used to fabricate complex architectures , is well suited . 3d printing is an adjustable , robotic platform allowing for tailored deposition of biomaterials using computer-aided design systems to formulate layer-by-layer custom designs with controlled architecture and composition . \n\n masks \n\n n95 respirators masks have two advantages over surgical , paper or cloth masks : 1 ) they are > 95 % efficient at filtering 0.3-microm airborne particles and 2 ) they are fit tested to each user to ensure an adequate seal , such that air and small droplets do not enter around the edges of the mask and into the health care worker 's breathing zone . the centers for disease control and prevention recommends n95 masks for health care workers taking care of patients with covid-19 . \n\n 3d printing can be used to produce tailored seal designs for improving mask comfort and fit . to customize face mask seals , 3d laser scanning can be implemented to scan exact facial parameters , with a tailored and customized face seal n95 template . anthropometric data of the chin arc , jawline , face and nose lengths , and nose protrusion measurements can be taken into account with this customized seal . in a study using face seal prototypes with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic using a fused deposition modeling 3d printer , three subjects showed improved contact pressure compared with use of 3m 8210 n95 ffr respirator masks . moreover , a personalized mask may account for facial hair length and density for a more precise fit . \n\n displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . the biomaterials displayed in this image have been fully characterized in the medical literature , with the same material composition of n95 masks . the mask includes several layers thereby ensure effective filtration of viral particles . \n\n figure 1 \n\n standard n95 masks consist of filtration material composed of electrostatic non-woven polypropylene ( pp ) fibers which are semi-rigid , lightweight and fatigue resistant . the semi-crystalline structure may cause significant distortion of the 3d printed parts upon cooling thereby making 3d printing difficult . material extrusion 3d printing was used to design a 3d printable thermoplastic elastomeric material from a blend of polypropylene ( pp ) and styrene- ( ethylene-butylene ) -styrene ( sebs ) . this blend provides better printability and flexibility for n95 mask design . pp is commonly used for various industrial applications due to its low cost , processability , printability , recyclability and mechanical integrity . sebs is a polymeric elastomer with low processing temperature and low distortion during extrusion . thus , the pp/sebs combination would improve the processability of 3d printed n95 masks . moreover , controlling the thermoplastic elastomer ratio allows for tailoring the flexibility and elasticity of the 3d model material for better fitted masks . 3d melt electrospinning printing can also be used to create pp microfibers with sequential layering to accurately obtain a 3d form . thus , 3d printing procedures may allow for the creation of stable and biocompatible n95 masks that are comparable to industrial manufacturing brands . figure 1 displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . \n\n face shields \n\n polycarbonate and polyester , polyvinyl chloride and other synthetic polymers are commonly used to make surgical face shields . these biomaterials are transparent , lightweight and provide high optical clarity . the polymers can easily be printed using 3d technology to meet the needs of healthcare workers treating covid-19 . \n\n covid-19 specimen collection kit \n\n creating 3d printed test swabs would help increase covid-19 testing capacity . nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs can be made from a flexible polymer , using polystyrene for the shaft . the tip can be tailored to be micro fine using computer-aided design software . thereafter , swab bud lattice fibers can be made from calcium alginate using hydrogels using 3d tissue engineering . \n\n ventilator valves \n\n ventilator valves are attachments used to deliver oxygen at fixed concentrations for patients with acute respiratory distress , including covid-19 patients . 3d printing technology can be used via a filament extrusion system or a polymer-laser powder bed fusion process to print single-use valve sets . 3d printers can design the different elements of the valve using biomaterials such as polyamide and polysulfone , polycarbonate , silicone rubber and stainless steel . furthermore , these disposable valves eliminate time-consuming sterilization . \n\n medications \n\n 3d printing techniques , such as fused filament , inkjet , extrusion and powder extrusion , allow for fabrication of 3d printed pills . medication-printing technologies typically utilize a small nozzle to lay thin disc-shaped layers of powders and deposit microscopic droplets of liquid to bind the materials . a coaxial needle extrusion 3d technology was used to print active pharmaceutical ingredients and create combinations of controlled dosing of drugs . while there are no specific antivirals or vaccines for treatment of covid-19 , several well-characterized anti-viral drugs are being considered as therapies . it may be possible to use 3d medication-printing technology to effectively and rapidly print lopinavir/ritonavir , chloroquine , and hydroxychloroquine pills . thus , 3d technology has the potential to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry , making drug research , development and production applicable to covid-19 patients . \n\n as the covid-19 outbreak rapidly evolves , there has been a personal protective equipment shortage globally . 3d printing inventions can be rapidly applied to address these deficiencies . cost , processing time , testing , and manpower are potential barriers to creating 3d-printed personal protective equipment . however , the synthetic polymer biomaterials needed for 3d-printed personal protective equipment are exact or very similar in composition to the standard manufacturing grade products ( i.e . n95 masks provides the same fluid barrier and air filtration protection ) . moreover , these synthetic polymer materials are readily available and cost effective ( i.e . polypropylene is 12.47 cents per pound ) . 3d printer costs vary but are an excellent investment with labor performed via robotics . in conjunction with flattening the curve via social distancing , this pioneering technology can provide adequate personal protective equipment for health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic . \n\n abbreviations : \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) \n\n three-dimensional ( 3d ) \n\n polypropylene ( pp ) \n\n

00010010	transmission potential of the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) onboard the diamond princess cruises ship , 2020 \n\n an outbreak of covid-19 developed aboard the princess cruises ship during january-february 2020 . using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members , we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak . our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore ( approximate range : 1.1-7 ) . our findings suggest that rt decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control . most recent estimates of rt reached values largely below the epidemic threshold , indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n introduction \n\n while the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) spread rapidly throughout china for several weeks since december 2019 , the virus had not taken off outside china in part due to the unprecedented social distancing measures that the chinese government put in place . one exception is the outbreak of covid-19 that developed aboard the diamond princess ship which was detected in early february when one of its passengers , a traveler from hong kong , tested positive for the novel coronavirus . the number of cases in the diamond princess ship quickly jumped to 454 confirmed cases by february 18 , 2020 . in contrast , the total number of cases in singapore , one of the countries with the highest number of covid-19 cases after china , was only 77 at the time . \n\n accumulating evidence indicates that the novel coronavirus can spread widely in confined settings including hospitals , cruise ships , prisons , and churches . in wuhan city , china , outbreaks inside health care settings led to the infection of hundreds of health professionals . in tokyo , japan , most of the reported infections have been linked to a party inside a traditional wooden ship , called yakatabune while most of the infections in korea have affected members of one church and one hospital . \n\n tracking the evolution of the transmission potential of covid-19 in different confined settings and how it compares with that of other respiratory diseases such influenza has public health implications . when outbreaks occur in confined settings , it is useful to investigate how the effective reproduction number changes as a result of interventions strategies such as the quarantine that the japanese government imposed on travelers and crew members aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n in this study we sought to characterize the temporal variation in the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak aboard the princess cruises ship using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data by dates of symptoms onset describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members . \n\n epidemiological incidence cases \n\n in yokohama , japan , an outbreak of covid-19 has been unfolding on board the princess cruise ship , which has been under quarantine orders since february 5 , 2020 , after a former passenger of the diamond princess ship tested positive for the virus after disembarking in hong kong . as of february 22 , 2020 , two days after the scheduled two-week quarantine came to an end , a total of 621 symptomatic and asymptomatic people including one quarantine officer , one nurse and one administrative officer tested positive for covid-19 out of the 3711 passengers and crew members on board . laboratory tests by pcr that prioritize symptomatic or high-risk groups have been conducted . \n\n incidence curves of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases of covid-19 among passengers and crew members of the outbreak unfolding aboard the princess cruises ship are publicly available from the national institute of infectious diseases , japan ( niid ) website . daily time series of symptomatic patients , from january 20 , 2020 to february 18 , 2020 were extracted . however , to reconstruct the trajectory of the epidemic , only 197 cases have dates of symptoms onset are available out of a total of 300 confirmed symptomatic cases . \n\n of the 103 symptomatic cases with missing onset dates , a total of the 79 cases are passengers while 24 cases are crew members . moreover , out of the 79 passenger cases , 30 cases were reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 21 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 28 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . of 24 crew member cases , 1 case was reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 15 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 8 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . \n\n epidemiological modeling \n\n we connected the daily incidence series with a discrete-time integral equation to describe the epidemic dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . specifically , let fs denote the probability mass function of the serial interval of covid-19 , where the serial interval is defined as the time from illness onset in the primary case to time of illness onset in the secondary case . then fs , of length s days , is given by \n\n for s > 0 , f ( s ) represents the cumulative distribution function of the gamma distribution . we characterized the expected number of new incident cases e [ ci , t ] in type i at symptom onset week t as follows , where rij denotes the average number of cases of type i infected by a single individual of type j . here we assume that the incidence , ci , t , follows a poisson sampling process with expected value e [ ci , t ] . \n\n the reproduction matrix for each type is given by \n\n this matrix is referred to as a next-generation matrix ( ngm ) in a fully susceptible population ( , pp . 873-885 ) . using this matrix , we derive the instantaneous time-dependent effective reproduction number , rt , for the entire transmission dynamics from the largest eigenvalue of the ngm . under the assumption that the per-contact infection probability and the generation interval are consistent over time regardless of the type of infection , the ngm quantifies the within type and inter-type patterns of transmission . the sum of the value in column j is the reproduction number for a specific type j . \n\n serial interval estimates of covid-19 were derived from previous studies of covid-19 , indicating that it follows a gamma distribution with the mean and sd at 7.5 and 3.4 days , respectively , based on ref .. the maximum value of the serial interval was fixed at 20 days as the cumulative probability distribution of the gamma distribution up to 20 days reaches 0.991 . \n\n we estimated model parameters and made projections using a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) method in

of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 . passenger and crew also have total ( within-type and inter-type ) rt values largely below the epidemic threshold , with only small percentages at 0 % and 9 % above the epidemic threshold , respectively ( table 3 ) . \n\n discussion \n\n this is the first study to assess the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak that unfolded aboard the diamond princess ship , january-february 2020 . the overall mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore in the range 1.1-7 . however , following the implementation of the quarantine period , the overall rt decreased substantially compared to values estimated during the early stage , but it exhibited fluctuations around the epidemic threshold , which likely prolonged the outbreak . \n\n our results indicate that rt declined following the quarantine measures implemented by the japanese government on february 5 relative to values during the early phase of the outbreak . importantly , only those passengers and crew who tested positive for the novel coronavirus were permitted to disembark the diamond princess ship , with more than 80 percentage of the passengers and crews still on board as of february 18 , 2020 . our latest overall estimate of rt at 0.35 ( 95 % cri : 0.02 , 2.19 ) with only 2 % of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 suggested a low probability of observing a subsequent outbreak aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n our findings indicate that the passenger-to-passenger transmission type dominated the transmission dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . the rapid increase in the overall rt from day 12 ( january 31 , 2020 ) to day 19 ( february 7 , 2020 ) is greatly influenced by the increase in passenger-to-passenger transmission , and this time period covers the time lag between february 1 , 2020 when the index covid-19 case was reported and february 5 , 2020 when the japanese government requested the passengers to stay inside their cabin after the detection of a cluster of covid-19 positive cases . upon the implementation of the quarantine orders , the overall rt and rt for passengers aboard the diamond princess ship declined thereafter , while rt among crew maintained a steady level and only started to decline on day 25 of the outbreak ( february 13 , 2020 ) . this is consistent with the fact that passengers staying inside their cabins led to a substantial decline in passenger-to-passenger transmission type except for their interaction with cabin mates . indeed , the proportion of secondary infections inside the cabins increased from 7 % ( 1/15 ) on february 6 , 43 % ( 3/7 ) on february 10 , 2020 to 100 % ( 1/1 ) on february 14 , 2020 . thus , a high proportion of the symptomatic cases after the quarantine gradually shifted from largely passenger cases to crew cases . indeed , despite their potential risk of acquiring the infection , crews had to continue to work to deliver services to isolated passengers . the distribution of the median re by transmission type suggests that other transmission types likely contributed to this outbreak to some extent ( fig . 3 ) . because one quarantine officer , one nurse , and one administrative officer contracted covid-19 aboard the diamond princess ship , the infection risk continued to be significant inside the diamond princess ship . \n\n as for the crude asymptomatic ratios by age groups , they show significant differences across age groups . however , these crude ratios are severely influenced by the timing of specimen collection relative to the infection time . hence , these ratios could be better ascertained if additional data with the timing of specimen collection becomes available . \n\n several limitations should be listed . first , a total of 103 laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases with unknown onset dates were not incorporated in our analysis . although the high proportion of unavailable data ( 34 % ( 103/300 ) ) likely influenced a downward bias in estimates of transmission potential , our estimates still point to the high transmission potential of covid-19 inside confined settings . second , it is possible that reporting delays could have influenced our latest estimates of the effective reproduction number . in fact , the us government recently sent a chartered flight to transport the american passengers on board the diamond princess ship , and after the disembarkation process , a total of 14 american passengers tested positive for the disease on february 16 , 2020 . this event also contributes to a downward bias in r although the number of cases does not exceed the peak of the outbreak , further supporting the potent transmissibility of covid-19 in confined settings . \n\n our most recent estimate of the effective reproduction number of the ongoing covid-19 epidemic on board the diamond princess ship was largely below the epidemic threshold of 1.0 , which suggested a very low probability of observing secondary outbreaks of the disease in the diamond princess ship . \n\n funding statement \n\n km acknowledges support from the japan society for the promotion of science kakenhi grant number 18k17368 and from

00001000	contact transmission of covid-19 in south korea : novel investigation techniques for tracing contacts \n\n in the epidemiological investigation of an infectious disease , investigating , classifying , tracking , and managing contacts by identifying the patient 's route are important for preventing further transmission of the disease . however , omissions and errors in previous activities can occur when the investigation is performed through only a proxy interview with the patient . to overcome these limitations , methods that can objectively verify the patient 's claims ( medical facility records , global positioning system , card transactions , and closed-circuit television ) were used for the recent ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 contact investigations in south korea . \n\n introduction \n\n an epidemiological investigation aims to quickly determine the prevalence of an infectious disease whilst simultaneously revealing the cause , and source of the disease , and explore the transmission process to ultimately prevent the spread of the infectious disease . as individuals become the source of the infectious disease , and if person-to-person transmission is suspected , it is important to immediately identify , and manage people that are in close contact with suspected patients . in particular , if there are several unknown epidemiological and clinical characteristics , and an effective medical intervention is lacking ( as in the case of new infectious diseases such as covid-19 ) , contact management becomes 1 of the core strategies to minimize additional transmission . for these strategies to be successful , it is necessary to evaluate between-person exposure risk in all locations where there have been confirmed cases ( after the onset of symptoms ) , and to classify contact persons based on this risk . furthermore , it is also important to eliminate the possibility of exposure to infection in the places visited by the confirmed patient , by performing the appropriate disinfection of areas that can harbor environmental contamination . however , traditional investigative methods , depending on the patient or proxy interview , has the limitation of omissions and errors of previous activities . \n\n the covid-19 outbreak in china occurred on december 8th , 2019 , and the first case in korea was reported on january 20th , 2020 . as of february 14th , the total number of confirmed cases of covid-19 in korea was 28 . in the current epidemiological investigation contact investigation techniques that were used on a limited basis for the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) outbreak in 2015 , are being used in all confirmed cases of covid-19 . \n\n this report will provide a general overview of the contact investigation from the covid-19 national emergency response center , epidemiology and case management team and describe the various methods used to evaluate exposure risk . \n\n results \n\n covid-19 contact investigation and management comprised of the following : 1 ) determination of the location of the contact ( patient route ) , 2 ) exposure risk evaluation , 3 ) contact classification , and 4 ) contact management . the location of the contact was determined through the process of preliminary identification , by interviewing patients , and their acquaintances , and by objective verification of the investigated information . exposure risk evaluation was performed depending on the route of disease transmission , patient characteristics , and environmental characteristics . based on the results of the evaluation , the contacts were classified into close and casual contacts depending on the exposure . the method of managing the classified contacts was largely distinguished between movement restriction and symptom monitoring . movement restriction is a legal public health order , and quarantine ( isolation ) , home isolation , or controlled travel is enacted . symptom monitoring was performed as either active or passive monitoring , depending on the exposure risk ( figure 1 ) . \n\n the methods used to overcome recall and confirmation biases that can occur while determining the location of the contact include checking medical facilities records , phone-based global positioning system ( gps ) , card transaction records , and closed-circuit television ( cctv ; table 1 ) . \n\n 1 . history of using medical facilities and visiting pharmacies \n\n history of using medical facilities , and visiting pharmacies was used to estimate the window of time of infection , through an accurate evaluation of the clinical symptoms of the infectious disease , and initial onset of the symptoms . if a medical facility was included in the patient 's route , quarantine of the medical facility was conducted . \n\n 2 . gps \n\n consistency in the recall of the route of the patients identified through interview was evaluated . additionally , identification of the routes that the patient could not remember was also possible . however , another person 's information can be misunderstood as the patient 's information if the phone is not owned by or carried by the patient . gps uses cellular phone networks , therefore there are limitations in identifying the exact locations of a patient 's route . \n\n 3. credit card transaction log \n\n credit card transaction logs were used to assess the consistency in the route of the patient identified through interview , and the scope of contacts was assessed by specifying the locations visited . however , if the patient did not use a credit card under their name or if another person used the patient 's card , the information may be misinterpreted . thus , rechecking the contents of the credit card log was necessary , and instances of not being able to use the information at the appropriate time may occur . \n\n 4 . cctv \n\n by checking the video footage of the location of a patient 's path , cctv provided help to identify the details of each situation . for example , cctv was used to evaluate the level of exposure risk by identifying whether the patient wore masks , or had respiratory symptoms such as a cough . the limitations of using cctv were the lengthy time required to check the cctv , and the accuracy of patient identification if the cctv was not inside the facility or the patient was in a blind spot of the camera . \n\n discussion \n\n based on the experience of the mers outbreak in 2015 , laws were revised to supplement the areas that were lacking at the time . korea centers for disease control and prevention were able to use relevant information in epidemiological investigations to contain and prevent infection , thus enabling the establishment of a more comprehensive management of infectious diseases . furthermore , making accurate information available to the general public helps to minimize fear and confusion with respect to the risk of transmissibility of the disease . the use of methods that have objectively verified the patient 's route claims ( medical facility records , gps , card transactions , and cctv ) for covid-19 contact investigations in south korea has provided accurate information on the location , and time of exposure , and details of the situation , thus reducing omissions in a patient 's route due to recall or confirmation bias that may have arisen from patient or proxy interviews . \n\n however , the publicization of a patient 's route for the public 's benefit infringes upon the privacy of the patient . thus , it is necessary to establish a protocol to protect privacy . equally , more effort should be taken to provide accurate information to the public . patient information that is unrelated to the communication of risk of infectious diseases must be protected by clearly defining the standards of publicization and reporting of patient information for the public 's benefit when an infectious disease is prevalent . \n\n with regards to responding to the recent prevalence of covid-19 , korea centers for disease control and prevention are performing defense activities to contain and prevent infection at the appropriate time , with more objective and accurate methods for monitoring patient contacts by using personal information . however , an evaluation of the effectiveness of these monitoring methods when multiple patients are involved , is necessary after the situation has been controlled . epidemiological investigations require the collaboration of various related persons and must be conducted through a strict verification process . furthermore , investigations must be performed using systematic processes with scientific methods and principles , and cycles of continuous evaluation and feedback to identify the etiology , extent , progression and therapy for the infectious disease and the development of public health policies . \n\n conflicts of interest \n\n the authors declare no competing

00001000	strategic planning to augment the testing capacity for covid-19 in india . \n\n background & objectives : nearly 5,500 tests for coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) had been conducted on march 31 , 2020 across the indian council of medical research ( icmr ) -approved public and private laboratories in india . given the need to rapidly increase testing coverage , we undertook an exercise to explore and quantify interventions to increase the daily real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qrt-pcr ) -based testing capacity over the next few months . the objective of this exercise was to prepare a potential plan to scale-up covid-19 testing in india in the public sector . methods : potential increase in daily testing capacity of the existing public laboratories was calculated across the three base scenarios of shifts ( 9 , 16 and 24 h ) . additional testing capacity was added for each shift scenario based on interventions ranging from procurement of additional qrt-pcr machines , leveraging spare capacity on available qrt-pcr machines not drafted into covid-19 testing , to in-laboratory process optimization efforts . results : moving to a 24 h working model in the existing approved laboratories can enhance the daily testing capacity to 40,464 tests/day . the capacity can be further bolstered by leveraging qrt-pcr and nucleic acid amplification test ( naat ) -based machines available with the multidisciplinary research units ( mrus ) , national aids control organisation ( naco ) and national tuberculosis elimination programme ( ntep ) . using combination/multiplex kits , and provision of automated rna extraction platforms at all laboratories could also optimize run time and contribute to capacity increase by 1.5-2 times . interpretation & conclusions : adopting these interventions could help increase public sector 's daily testing capacity to nearly 100,000-120,000 tests/day . it is important to note that utilization of the scaled-up testing capacity will require deployment of additional workforce , procurement of corresponding commodities for testing and scale-up of sample collection and transportation efforts . 
01100000	using integrated computational approaches to identify safe and rapid treatment for sars-cov-2 \n\n abstract \n\n sars-cov-2 is a new generation of coronavirus , which was first determined in wuhan , china , in december 2019 . so far , however , there no effective treatment has been found to stop this new generation of coronavirus but discovering of the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 main protease ( sars-cov-2 mpro ) may facilitate searching for new therapies for sars-cov-2 . the aim was to assess the effectiveness of available fda approved drugs which can construct a covalent bond with cys145 inside binding site sars-cov-2 main protease by using covalent docking screening . we conducted the covdock module mmgbsa module in the schrodinger suite 2020-1 , to examine the covalent bonding utilizing . besides , we submitted the top three drugs to molecular dynamics simulations via gromacs 2018.1 . the covalent docking showed that saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir and prevacid have the highest binding energies mmgbsa of -72.17 , -72.02 , -65.19 , -57.65 , -54.25 , -51.8 , and -51.14 kcal/mol , respectively . the 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation was conducted for saquinavir , ritonavir and remdesivir to evaluate the stability of these drugs inside the binding pocket of sars-cov-2 main protease . the current study provides a powerful in silico results , means for rapid screening of drugs as anti-protease medications and recommend that the above-mentioned drugs can be used in the treatment of sars-cov-2 in combined or sole therapy . \n\n communicated by ramaswamy h. sarma \n\n introduction \n\n sars-cov-2 also called 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ' abbreviated sars-cov-2 was recognized to be the causative of atypical pneumonia ( joshi , ; pant et al. , ) outbreak in wuhan , china ( hasan , ; s. a. khan et al. , 2020 ) . the virus belongs to the family known as 'coronaviruses ' because of the crown-like appearance of spikes glycoproteins on the envelope under an electron microscope ( y chen et al. , ) . world health organization ( who ) recently announced that the virus transforms from epidemic to pandemic , which requires urgent intervention to prevent the growing spread of the virus across the globe ( chan et al. , ) . the total confirmed cases 2,347,884 with 738,923 cases in the united state of america ( usa ) alone and the total death of 161,138 ( as of april 19 ) , with mortality estimated within 2 % and about 3.4 % , according to estimates of approved cases and death worldwide ( n. chen et al. , ) . the most familiar is a virus that arose from the rhinolophus bat which is > 96 % homologous with the modern sars-cov-2 virus and it is just 79 % homologous with the initial sars-cov ( fisher & heymann , ) . the fast-growing number of infected cases globally urged the world health organization to announce a state of global health emergency to correlate scientific and medical disciplines to develop rapidly an effective treatment for patients , ( morse et al. , ; sarma et al. , ) elderly patients and people with severe underlying health diseases like heart diseases , lung illness , and diabetic patients , for instance , appear to be at greater risk of revealing severe sars-cov-2 requires immediate intervention rather than waiting virus vaccine which may require 1 year to be available ( enayatkhani , ) . while drug repurposing could be a short-term and fast resolution to handle sars-cov-2 patients ( elfiky , ; r. j. khan et al. , 2020 ; kumar et al. , ) , repurposing existing drugs can offer a good choice to overcome the virus and offer better risk-versus trade-off as compared with discovering new drug and can help overcome time waiting for new therapy rather than use the available resources ( elmezayen , ; muralidharan , ) one successful repurposing drug story includes duloxetine which originally developed for depression and fda approved as the first-in-class choice for stress urinary incontinence ( sweeney & chancellor , ) , duloxetine initially created as antidepressant also is now passed to phase iii clinical trials as a first-in-class treatment for premature ejaculation ( mcmahon , ) and thalidomide , which had a tragic start as an over-the-counter sedative for morning sickness in pregnancy is now being applied to manage leprosy and multiple myeloma ( hideshima & anderson , ) . \n\n as a result of , a newly issued x-ray crystal of sars-cov-2 main protein ( mpro ) , we planning to use computational approaches ( cameron et al. , 2013 ) to contribute to find an effective treatment for sars-cov-2.thereby , computational analyses speed up these approaches since they allow to handle millions of data simultaneously ( gupta et al. , 2020 ) . molecular docking includes a set of computational methods and algorithms that aimed to identify novel relationships between chemical ligands and targets through using the modelling of their direct physical interaction ( aanouz , ; ekins et al. , ) . in present study , we attend to evaluate some of approved drugs to be as covalent binders , irreversible interactions , which can provide a powerful strategy to fight against epidemic viruses . and molecular dynamics simulations can give a more detail for the image which got from molecular covalent docking . \n\n materials and methods \n\n covalent virtual screening \n\n the crystal structure of fda-available covalent drugs which available in table 1 were selected based on the review of kumalo et al . and some of the antiviral drugs that can form a covalent bond to the target protein . and we aim also here to redirect them for other indications specially to see their possibility to fight against sars-cov-2 . thence , we searched about the chosen drugs in pubchem ( https : //pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) to identify the possibility of the selected drugs to be as covalent binders toward sars-cov-2 mpro . where , pubchem provides detailed information about the selected drugs rather than other repositories , especially , the property of drug to form covalent bond . before starting covalent docking , we downloaded the selected drugs one by one and optimize them by using the ligprep ( lim et al. , ) based on the opls_2005 force field and generated possible state employing epik in the schrodinger 2020 ( elfiky ; s. a. khan et al.,2020 ) . in the next step , the structure of sars-cov-2 mpro ( 6lu7 ) was downloaded from protein data bank ( http : //www.rcsb.org/pdb ) ( jin et al . , ) . the protease structure was optimized by adding hydrogens , removing water molecules and optimizing charge using the protein preparation wizard module ( kumalo et al. , ) in schrodinger suite 2020-1 . the covalent docking protocol was preferred since the cysteine 145 residue which is available in the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro considered as a vital residue that can form a covalent bond with the drug if it can interact covalently . the different mechanisms for the cys145-fda drug were mentioned in table 1 based on the nature of the drug so that the reactive functional group on the ligand and receptor residue are identified and the bond is formed between the correct atoms . these covalently docked complexes were created using covdock in schrodinger suite 2020-1 . finally , we selected the lowest the mmgbsa value for each drug as a propriate conformation of the drug inside the binding pocket . \n\n entry name pubchem id molecular

docking results showing type of based reaction for constructing covalent bond , docking score , glide score and rmsd . \n\n prime mm-gbsa \n\n the chosen drugs binding energies were calculated using prime mm-gbsa modules ( vijayakumar et al. , ) in the schrodinger ( 2020 ) . the best poses of selected drugs : sars-cov-2 mpro : were chosen to obtain the binding free energy calculation . prime mmgbsa is a method that combines optimized potential for liquid simulations-all atoms ( oplsaa ) force field , molecular mechanics energies ( emm ) , an sgb solvation model for polar solvation ( gsgb ) , and a non-polar solvation term ( gnp ) composed of the non-polar solvent accessible surface area and van der waals interactions . the total binding free energy : delta gbind = gcomplex - ( g-protein + gligand ) . \n\n molecular dynamics simulation \n\n molecular dynamics simulations are a decision-making process for inspections of protein-drug complexes ' stabilities ( al-khafaji & taskin tok , ) . it is used to clarify the dynamic behavior at an atomic level of biological systems , which is hard to handle in labs ( shukla et al. , ) . in the current study , we conducted molecular dynamics simulations for the top three drugs based on mmgbsa values . the got protein-drug complex structures from covalent docking were submitted to md simulations ( saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir with sars-cov-2 mpro ) . we hired gromacs 2018.1 to run 50 ns md simulations ( abraham et al. , ) . charmm 27 force field for all atoms were chosen to run md simulation ( bjelkmar et al. , ) . we used swiss param to produce the topologies of drugs ( zoete et al. , ) . all protein-drug systems were solvated with three-point transferable intermolecular potential ( tip3p ) and their charges were neutralized via adding na or cl ions . in the following step , the protein-drugs systems were energetically minimized through the steepest descent algorithm at a tolerance value of 1000 kj/mol.nm . then the equilibration with position restraint on the protein molecules for 0.1 ns using nvt and npt ensembles were done . electrostatic interactions were evaluated by particle mesh ewald summation ( darden et al. , ) . we performed the molecular dynamics simulation with no restraint on the protein molecules or ligand to determine the stability in the final step ( time step of 0.015 ns ) . rmsd , rmsf , rg , and number of hydrogen bonds were chosen to analyze md trajectories by using gromacs utilities . \n\n principal component analysis \n\n the principal component analysis ( pca ) approach was employed to calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues and their projection along with the first two principal components ( al-khafaji & taskin tok , ) . this approach is based on the protocol of gromacs 2018.1 ( abraham et al. , ) . it is used to simplify the effect of drugs on the dynamic motion of the targeted protein where it extracts the dynamic motions in simulations that are required for their biological function ( amadei et al. , ) . we got the principal component analysis from the md trajectories . a series of eigenvectors and eigenvalues were generated by diagonalizing the matrix . we chose trajectories of the protein backbone of the complexes to get 2 d-projection of motion of trajectory . \n\n results \n\n to assess the possibility of selected fda drugs to work as treatment of sars-cov-2 , the covalent docking was utilized to screen the selected library and rank them according to their binding affinities . the calculated binding free energies of some available drugs using docking score , glide gscore , and ensemble-average mm/gbsa are shown in table 1 . \n\n to validate our covalent docking results , the correlation between mmgbsa and docking score was constructed ( figure 1 ) . the binding energy mmgbsa-docking score correlation shows a good correlation ( r2 = 0.6299 ) . based on this correlation , we chose the top three ranked-mmgbsa and docking score values of fda drugs for dissection their binding modes inside the binding site . covalent docking showed that saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir , and prevacid have -72.17 , -72.02 , -65.19 , -57.65 , -54.25 , -51.8 , and -51.14 , respectively . where all the top-eight fda drugs show a higher affinity to form a covalent , irreversible bond with cys145 of sars-cov-2 mpro . here we investigated the role of molecular weight upon the affinity of selected drugs to bind covalently to cys145 , whereas 57 % of selected drugs which have molecular weight over than 600 g/mol ( figure 2 ) . and have higher free binding energy mmgbsa than -50 kcal/mol . while the ratio of selected drugs decreased to be 16 % of drugs which can form covalent bonding with over than -50 kcal/mol . surprisingly , none of the selected drugs which have a molecular weight below than 300 g/mol can form a good affinity of binding energy . this indicates that higher molecular weight covalent warheads can form stable and efficient binding energy . \n\n the correlation between mmgbsa binding energies and docking score . \n\n effect of molecular weight upon the mmgbsa binding energy . \n\n docked complex analyses \n\n what stands out in the table 1 is saquinavir has the highest binding affinity ( lowest binding energy mmgbsa of 72.17 kcal/mol ) . therefore , the deep examination of saquinavir is needed . figure 3 shows that saquinavir not only formed covalent bond of 1.81 a with cys145 but also formed five hydrogen bonds inside the pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro . in the second rank ritonavir as presented in table 1 has -72.02 kcal/mol . \n\n covalent docking analysis of saquinavir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n this high affinity resulted from covalent bond between ritonavir and cys145 of 1.82 a ( figure 4 ) through nucleophilic addition to double bond reaction besides it interacted within binding site by forming three hydrogen bonds . despite remdesivir formed covalent bond with cys145 of 1.82 a and three hydrogen bonds ( figure 5 ) and this is similar to ritonavir , but the mmgbsa value is lower than that of ritonavir this may due to nature of reaction which in remdesivir nucleophilic addition to triple bond . \n\n covalent docking analysis of ritonavir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n covalent docking analysis of remdesivir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n molecular dynamic simulation \n\n the effect of drug-protein interactions upon dynamics of biological system is a fundamental in drug discovery thereby we used rmsd to investigate the influence of saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir upon the stability of sars-cov-2 mpro . we utilized gromacs to execute the md simulations of 50 ns for three drug-protein systems besides of apo protein . rmsd fluctuations for both apo and hollo forms were measured and presented . the rmsd was calculated to assess the overall dynamics , stability , and convergence of the various systems and the results are presented in figure 6 ( a ) . \n\n analysis of rmsd , rmsf , rg and hydrogen bonding of saquinvir-sars-cov-2 mpro , ritonavir- sars-cov-2 mpro and remdesivir- sars-cov-2 mpro . ( a ) the protein 's backbone rmsd values with respect to time . ( b ) rmsf of the protein 's backbone with respect to position of residue in the protein . ( c ) rg of the protein backbone over the entire time of md simulation . ( d ) the number of hydrogen bonds through all the time of md simulation . \n\n figure 6 ( a ) shows there is a significant decrease in the rmsd value when sars-cov-2 main protease whether it bound to saquinavir , ritonavir , or remedisivir . further analysis revealed that the rmsd average of apo sars-cov-2 main protease was 0.294 nm but when it bound to saquinavir , ritonavir , and remedisivir the rmsd averages were.01865 , 0.2130 , and 0.2053 nm , respectively . another significant aspect of md simulation is the flexibility of protein 's backbone which can be assessed through measuring rmsf value . the results of the comparative analysis between these drugs and their effects upon sars-cov-2 main protease are illustrated in figure 6 ( b ) . closer scrutiny of figure 6 ( b ) exhibits the binding of saquinavir diminished the fluctuations of the protein 's backbone . and behavior is also can be seen from figure 6 ( b ) where the binding of both ritonavir and remedisivir led to reducing the flexibility of the protein . the radius of gyration ( rg ) is a definition of system 's density , and substantially influences the folding rate and stability of proteins . rg was employed to assess the compactness of all complexes . in this work , rg values are in agreement with rmsf values where there are no significant differences between apo form and hollo forms as presented in figure 6 ( c ) . this reveals that protein remained stable and compact all through the 50 ns time . the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds is a vital aspect to give an impression about the stability of drug and protein . also , the number of hydrogen bonds is relevant to the binding scores of molecular docking process . we calculated the hydrogen bonds over time to validate the stable interactions between top three drugs and their corresponding target . as seen in the figure 6 ( d ) the ritonavir has highest order of hydrogen bonding ( the average =3.35 ) , while saquinavir has an average of 1.68 . \n\n principle component analysis ( pca ) \n\n the essential dynamic method is a tool to explore the dynamical behavior in the space of sars-cov-2 main protease combined with saquinavir , ritonavir , and remedisivir . basically , the comparison of the drug-bound sars-cov-2 mpro and drug-unbound was made as reference . in order to further understand the configurational space , we selected the first two principal components ( pc1 , pc2 ) to analyze their projection of trajectories during the simulations of ligand free and ligand bound sars-cov-2 mpro of the phase space ( shown in figure 7 ) . during the four system simulations , the results clearly show that the unbound ligand protein covered a wider region of phase space , while all three drug-protein system occupied a smaller region of phase space . especially , saquinavir reduced the essential dynamics to lowest degree of functional motions as compared with another drugs . moreover , the pca results suggest that the drug-bound sars-cov-2 mpro is more stable than ligand-unbound sars-cov-2 mpro form of sars-cov-2 mpro . in short , the pca results are also in agreement with the rmsd and rmsf results , which enhance the validity of the performed analysis . \n\n two-dimensional projection of motion of trajectory of sars-cov-2 mpro bound with drugs over the pc1 and pc2 . \n\n discussion \n\n sars-cov-2 causes major pandemic health issue since its spread across the world and can infect humans mainly respiratory system causing severe pneumonia with no vaccine and drug treatment available . prior study that have referred to the significance of molecular docking to determine effective treatment in short time ( wu , et al. , ) . in reviewing the literature , we took the advantage of possibility of fda available drugs that can be as a covalent warhead to inhibit the sars-cov-2 mpro with cys145 . an initial objective of the project was to identify effective and applicable treatment . the present study focused on the main protease ( mpro ) , especially pdb id ( 6lu7 ) as a potential target for several marketed drugs as possible therapeutic option to combat the virus to see the capability of these drugs to bind with the cysteine 145 residue which is available in the binding site of sars-cov-2 main protease . the mpro in sars-cov-2 is necessary for the proteolytic maturation of the virus targeting this protein to limit the expansion of infection by hindering the cleavage of the viral polyprotein . the most interesting finding was that the both saquinavir and ritonavir have the same affinity ( binding energy mmgbsa -72 kcal/mol ) to block binding site of sars-cov-2 with irreversible interactions . this study supports evidence from previous observations that lopinavir/ritonavir can inhibit sars-cov-2 ( lim et al. , ) . another important outcome was that the remdesivir comes in second rank with binding affinity ( mmgbsa = -65 kcal/mol ) . whereas previous research has established that remdesivir can inhibit sars-cov-2 m proenzyme through docking results . another significant finding , delavirdine computationally showed the ability to form irreversible covalent bond of -57.65 kcal/mol mmgbsa binding energy . moreover , indinavir and cefuroxime axetil exhibited the possibility to halt the pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro by forming stable interaction through covalent bonding and hydrogen bonding ( mmgbsa binding energies -54 kcal/mol ) . furthermore , oseltamivir and prevacid exhibited same affinity to bind with sars-cov-2 protease through one covalent bond and one hydrogen bond ( -51 kcal/mol ) , which is a good explanation for the activity of oseltamivir ( peeri et al. , ) . in this study , results obtained show the binding affinity of drugs to an active site depends on several factors mainly the ability of a compound to form a covalent bond with amino acid residues of the mpro ( cys145 ) and length of a covalent bond , the number of h-bonds that can form with a pocket of the active site and type of nucleophilic addition of unsaturated bonds . in this concept , the structural features in saquinavir and ritonavir like free amine group ( -nh2 ) , hydroxyl groups ( -oh ) , carbonyl groups ( c=o ) in addition to ether group play key structural feature to form h-bond . results show the promising activities for antiretroviral drugs saquinavir that used for hiv/aids more than ritonavir and remdesivir followed by lopinavir as the best drugs to bind covalently toward sars-cov-2 mpro with lowest energy of binding . as discussed above , saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir , and prevacid showed the ability to block the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro by forming covalent bond and stabilized with hydrogen bonding . \n\n these outcomes are contrary to that of kandeel and al-nazawi ( 2020 ) , they found that ribavirin , telbivudine , vitamin b12 , and nicotinamide can be can form non-bonding interactions . whilst our results showed that , saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir can form irreversible interactions , which are considered an effective way for viral infections . \n\n in the present work , comparative molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir on the conformational and dynamical demeanor in either apo or hollo forms to understand the inhibitory possibility at atomic level . an initial mission of the project was to identify rapid , effective , safe , and available for large proportions of people , so we run covalent docking and mmgbsa to sift the possibility of these drug to form irreversible interactions . therefore , we had chosen these drugs because they carry covalent warheads that can bind covalently to the target . but the docking results are not adequate , so we run md simulations examine how much these drugs are able to form stable interactions with targeted protein . one interesting finding is the rmsd of protein backbone in apo status has higher average value , whereas the binding with top three drugs diminished these rmsd average . another important finding was that the rmsf of protein 's backbone be less flexible when it compared to apo form of sars-cov-2 main protease . it is somewhat surprising that the binding of three drugs have not noted in rg values . it is not yet clear whether the top three drugs can show an evidence to inhibit the targeted protein , thereby we lean on the principal component analysis to analyze the md trajectories to judge without dispute . the most obvious finding to emerge from 2d pca analysis is that the binding of under investigated drugs caused stately impact on essential dynamics of protein by reducing its essential dynamics to its least possible motions . these results seem to be consistent with rmsd results . a possible explanation for this might be that binding of the drugs make the binding site much narrower due to hydrogen bindings this makes the 3d structure of targeted protein more rigid so it will lose its biological functions . it is possible , therefore , that using these available drugs in two ways : either alone or in combined way . these findings suggest the possible use of nominated drugs against sars-cov-2 in short time as approved by covalent docking screening . also , the present results are significant in at least directing the clinicians to use these safe drugs to stop development of corona virus and second giving hope that available drugs that can be efficient treatment . \n\n conclusions \n\n coronavirus today emphasizes as a potential threat to all people worldwide . although extensive researches have been directed to stop sars-cov-2 , but till now there is no medication . meanwhile , the spreading with complicated crisis requires immediate therapy to overcome the spread and minimize mortality of sars-cov-2 . the aim of the present study was to discover effective treatment through repurposing some of available fda-approved drugs against sars-cov-2 mpro . where , they can provide covalent warheads in virtual screening . the most prominent finding to emerge from this study is that the affinity of covalent binder toward sars-cov-2 mpro is ranked : saquinavir > ritonavir > remdesivir > delavirdine > cefuroxime axetil > oseltamivir = prevacid . one of the more noteworthy findings in this study is that md simulation analysis that saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir can form stable interaction inside the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro . also , they restricted the essential motions of protein . overall , the results of screening toward mpret encourage for further clinical evaluations . they can be easy to reach and exploit as persuasive treatments for sars-cov-2 . \n\n acknowledgements \n\n authors thankful for staff membered of gaziantep university institute of health sciences , department of bioinformatics and computational biology . \n\n

00001000	strength , weakness , opportunity , threat ( swot ) analysis of the adaptations to anatomical education in the united kingdom and republic of ireland in response to the coivd-19 pandemic . \n\n the covid-19 pandemic has driven the fastest changes to higher education across the globe , necessitated by social distancing measures preventing any face to face teaching . this has led to an almost immediate switch to distance learning by higher education institutions . anatomy faces some unique challenges . intrinsically , anatomy is a three-dimensional subject that requires a sound understanding of the relationships between structures , often achieved by the study of human cadaveric material , models and virtual resources . this study sought to identify the approaches taken in the united kingdom and republic of ireland to deliver anatomical education through online means . data were collected from 14 different universities in the united kingdom and republic of ireland and compared adopting a thematic analysis approach . once themes were generated , they were collectively brought together using a strength , weakness , opportunity , threat ( swot ) analysis . key themes included the opportunity to develop new online resources and the chance to engage in new academic collaborations . academics frequently mentioned the challenge that time constrains could place on the quality and effectiveness of these resources ; especially as in many cases the aim of these resources is to compensate for a lack of exposure to cadaveric exposure . comparisons of the actions taken by multiple higher education institutions reveals the ways that academics have tried to balance this demand . discussions will facilitate decisions being made by higher education institutions regarding adapting the curriculum and assessment methods in anatomy . 
10001000	early trends for sars-cov-2 infection in central and north texas and impact on other circulating respiratory viruses . \n\n introduction : rapid diagnosis and isolation are key to containing the quick spread of a pandemic agent like sars-cov-2 , which has spread globally since its initial outbreak in wuhan province in china . sars-cov-2 is novel and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal viruses is just becoming apparent . we present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of march , 2020 . methods : this is a retrospective cohort study post launching of sars-cov-2 testing at baylor scott and white hospital ( bswh ) , temple , texas . testing for sars-cov-2 was performed by real-time rt-pcr assay and results were shared with state public health officials for immediate interventions . results : more than 3500 tests were performed during the first two weeks of testing for sars-cov-2 and identified 168 ( 4.7 % ) positive patients . sixty-two ( 3.2 % ) of the 1,912 ambulatory patients and 106 ( 6.3 % ) of the 1,659 ed/inpatients tested were positive . the highest rate of infection ( 6.9 % ) was seen in patients aged 25-34 years , while the lowest rate of infection was seen among patients aged < 25 years old ( 2 % ) . county-specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions . incidentally , this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of seasonal respiratory virus infections , perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness about sars-cov-2 among the general public , as well as the social distancing measures implemented in response to sars-cov-2 . data extracted for bswh from the cdc 's national respiratory and enteric virus surveillance system ( nrevss ) site revealed that influenza incidence was 8.7 % in march 2020 , compared to 25 % in march 2019 . conclusions : this study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management . this study provided sars-cov-2 testing data from ambulatory and inpatient population . epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like sars-cov-2 . this article is protected by copyright . all rights reserved . 
01000000	reverse vaccinology approach to design a novel multi-epitope vaccine candidate against covid-19 : an in silico study \n\n abstract \n\n at present , novel coronavirus ( 2019-ncov , the causative agent of covid-19 ) has caused worldwide social and economic disruption . the disturbing statistics of this infection promoted us to develop an effective vaccine candidate against the covid-19 . in this study , bioinformatics approaches were employed to design and introduce a novel multi-epitope vaccine against 2019-ncov that can potentially trigger both cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell immune responses and investigated its biological activities by computational tools . three known antigenic proteins ( nucleocapsid , orf3a , and membrane protein , hereafter called nom ) from the virus were selected and analyzed for prediction of the potential immunogenic b and t-cell epitopes and then validated using bioinformatics tools . based on in silico analysis , we have constructed a multi-epitope vaccine candidate ( nom ) with five rich-epitopes domain including highly scored t and b-cell epitopes . after predicting and evaluating of the third structure of the protein candidate , the best 3 d predicted model was applied for docking studies with toll-like receptor 4 ( tlr4 ) and hla-a * 11:01 . in the next step , molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation was used to evaluate the stability of the designed fusion protein with tlr4 and hla-a * 11:01 receptors . md studies demonstrated that the nom-tlr4 and nom-hla-a * 11:01 docked models were stable during simulation time . in silico evaluation showed that the designed chimeric protein could simultaneously elicit humoral and cell-mediated immune responses . \n\n communicated by ramaswamy h. sarma \n\n introduction \n\n coronavirus disease covid-19 outbreak began in late december 2019 in wuhan , the capital of hubei province , china ( wang et al. , ) . scientists from all over the world are attempting to investigate this novel virus , known as 2019-ncov , which is highly contagious , and to discover effective interventions to control and prevent the disease ( heymann , ; huang et al. , ) . coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses ( ssrna+ ) belonging to the coronaviridae family . human coronaviruses hcov-229e , hcov-nl63 , hcov-oc43 , and hcov-hku1 are observed in almost one-third of the common cold ( lim et al. , ) . however , recently some cases of human coronavirus infections have led to fatal endemics , including sars ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) , mers ( middle east respiratory syndrome ) and covid-19 that are common diseases between humans and animals whose belong to the genus betacoronavirus of the coronaviridae family ( al-tawfiq et al. , ) . so far , the novel covid-19 has caused more than 700,000 illnesses and more than 33,000 deaths worldwide ( w.h.o. , 2020 ) . the genome size of this virus is about 30 kb and encodes structural and non-structural proteins like other coronaviruses . structural proteins include s protein ( spike ) , e protein ( envelope ) , m protein ( membrane ) , and n protein ( nucleocapsid ) ( ahmed et al. , ) . the increasing rate of covid-19 disease and the high morbidity necessitate the development of a specific and safe vaccine candidate as soon as possible . there is very little known actually about the pathogenesis of the virus ; therefore , an immunoinformatics-based approach to investigate the immunogenic epitopes and vaccine design using data from proteins sequencing of the covid-19 is required . \n\n n protein is the only structural protein that associates with replicase-transcriptase complexes and binds with genomic rna in coronaviruses ( cong et al. , ) . this protein is multifunctional and one of the most crucial structural components of coronaviruses . n protein is a structural and antigenic protein that is involved in packaging , transcription , and replication coronaviruses ( 4 ) . this data showed that n protein is a suitable candidate for targeting drug and vaccine design because this protein is conserved , antigenic and multifunctional ( 6 ) . leung and et al . concluded that n protein can be a suitable vaccine candidate against sars-cov because induce strong antibody and this process may trigger cytokine production ( leung et al. , ) . coronaviruses m protein also has a key role in the assembly of virions . the sars-cov m protein can interact with n protein and make a network of interactions with the genomic rna ( he et al. , ) . ong and et al . the covid-19 antigens such as s , n and m proteins introduced as a vaccine candidate ( 6 ) . this protein has also been studied as an epitope vaccine candidate against sars-cov ( 7 ) . \n\n open reading frame 3a ( orf3a ) is required for viral replication and virulence of sars cov . severe induction of proinflammatory cytokine is a sign of sars-cov and mers-cov infections . orf3a activates both pro-il-1beta gene expression and il-1beta secretion and leads to severe lung injury . ( siu et al. , ) . also , orf3a has an important role in sars-cov assembly or budding with the participation of m and e proteins ( mcbride & fielding , ) . these proteins are not only involved in the pathogenesis of the covid-19 virus but also have high antigenicity ( chan et al. , ; siu et al. , ; xu et al. , ) . in this study e , m , n , orf10 , orf8 , orf3a and m proteins were evaluated by available bioinformatics tools for designing an efficient multi-epitope vaccine for the stimulation of immune responses against covid-19 infection . \n\n since the covid-19 has been recently discovered , little immunological information is available . preliminary studies based on phylogenetic analyses of the covid-19 whole genome have suggested that this virus is very similar to the sars-cov ( 79.7 % identify ) ( 9 , 14 ) . given the apparent similarity between the two viruses , it could be concluded that previous studies on the protective immune responses against sars-cov may be useful for developing a vaccine for covid-19 . previous studies have suggested that both humoral and cellular immunity play important roles in protective responses against this virus ( deming et al. , ; yang et al. , ) . studies revealed that the formation of antibodies against the n protein of sars-cov , an immunogenic protein that is highly expressed during infection , is relatively common in patients infected with this virus ( liu et al. , ; lin et al. , ) . although these antibodies are effective , they have a shorter lifespan in recovering the patients . in addition to the specific humoral immunity , it has been shown that the cd4+ and cd8+ responses provide long-lasting protection against covid-19 . these studies showed that besides antibody-mediated immune response , cellular immunity is critical to induce protectivity in these infections ( liu et al. , ) . the concept of a multi-epitope vaccine is to efficiently identify and assemble b and t-cell epitopes that are more capable of stimulating the immune system and therefore can induce more potent and effective both arms of immune responses . peptides and epitopes have shown to be desirable candidates for vaccine development due to their relatively easy production , chemical stability , and lack of infectious potential ( patronov & doytchinova , ) . the experimental design and production of multi-epitope vaccines have improved dramatically in recent years . these vaccines are mainly made up of b-cell , cd8+ cytolytic t-cell ( ctls ) and cd4+ helper t-cells ( htls ) epitopes ( chiarella et al. , ) . since the antigenic epitopes of a protein could be predicted and detected , therefore the whole protein is not suitable to stimulate an immune response ( testa & philip , ; zheng et al. , ) . during the development of a vaccine candidate against covid-19 , complex pathogenic mechanisms and numerous pathogenic factors should be considered in vaccine formulation . \n\n in the present study , we aimed to design a novel multi-epitope fusion protein ( nucleocapsid , orf3a , and membrane protein or nom ) containing more efficient antigenic epitopes-rich domains . the biological activity of the engineered fusion protein was assessed by bioinformatics tools using the interaction between the vaccine candidate and the innate immune system receptor ( tlr4 ) and cellular immune system receptor ( hla-a * 11:01 ) . we strongly believe that the outcome of the present report will provide a potential vaccine candidate against 2019-ncov . \n\n materials and methods \n\n in this study , we designed a suitable vaccine candidate against covid-19 , by exploiting the programs of reverse vaccinology ( figure 1 ) \n\n strategies employed in the overall study . \n\n retrieval of protein sequences \n\n at first , the amino acid sequences of proteins were retrieved from the national centre for biotechnology information ( ncbi ) at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov in fasta format and performed for subsequent analysis ( table 1 ) . \n\n name protein accession number fasta nucleocapsid protein qic53221.1 > qic53221.1 nucleocapsid protein [ severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ] [ severe acute

selected six proteins of covid-19 virus ( table 1 ) that have an essential role in virulence and replication of the virus , and previous studies have highlighted the necessity of these proteins in coronaviruses function . after the antigenic analysis of these proteins , three proteins of n , orf3a , and m were selected for final analysis . \n\n prediction of t-cell ( hla class i and ii ) epitopes \n\n 1d sequence-based screening server rankpep was used to identify t-cell epitopes ( reche & reinherz , ) . this server predicts peptide binders to mhc molecules from protein sequences using the position-specific scoring matrix ( pssm ) . we have selected all hla class i alleles from the selection panel of rankpep server for prediction of epitopes of hla class i . to prediction of epitopes of hla class ii , we considered drb1 * 0101 , drb1 * 0301 , drb1 * 0401 , drb1 * 0701 , drb1 * 0801 , drb1 * 1101 , drb1 * 1301 , and drb1 * 1501 that cover hla variability of over 95 % of the human population worldwide ( kruiswijk et al. , ) . \n\n b-cell epitopes ( linear ) identification \n\n for the prediction of b-cell epitopes , the amino acid sequence was analyzed using bepipred and kolaskar & tongaonkar antigenicity ( http : //www.iedb.org/ ) servers ( vita et al. , ) . bepipred for linear epitope prediction uses both hidden markov model and amino acid propensity scales methods . kolaskar and tongaonkar evaluate the protein for b cell epitopes using the physicochemical properties of the amino acids and their frequencies of occurrence in recognized b cell epitopes ( kolaskar & tongaonkar , ; mirza et al. , ) . \n\n selection of epitope-rich domains and the final sequence \n\n according to the prediction results of the servers used , b cell epitopes and hla class i and ii epitopes that have had high scores were extracted and combined to generate multi-epitope protein . b cell and t cell epitope-rich domains of n , orf3a and m proteins were selected and joined to each other with an aaa linker . \n\n antigenicity and allergenicity evaluation \n\n antigenicity of designed recombinant protein predicted using the vaxijen v2.0 server . the vaxijen classified antigens based on auto cross-covariance ( acc ) transformation of protein sequences into uniform vectors of principal amino acid properties which is a novel alignment-independent method and overcome the limitations of alignment-dependent sequence methods ( doytchinova & flower , ) . the prediction of vaccine candidate allergenicity is essential . the allergenicity of the designed protein was computed by allertop ( http : //www.ddg-pharmfac.net/allertop/ ) . allertop method predicts recombinant protein allergenicity on auto cross-covariance acc that describe residue hydrophobicity , size , abundance , helix- and beta-strand forming propensities ( dimitrov et al. , ) . allertop v.2 has the highest accuracy ( 88.7 % ) compared to several servers for allergen prediction ( dimitrov et al. , ) . \n\n the physicochemical parameters \n\n the analyzed parameters consisted of the molecular weight , theoretical pi , amino acid composition , atomic composition , extinction coefficient , estimated half-life , instability index , aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathicity that were evaluated by protparam online server ( http : //us.expasy.org/tools/ protparam.html ) ( gasteiger et al. , ) . \n\n secondary and tertiary structure prediction \n\n gor was used for the designed protein secondary structure prediction ( https : //npsa-prabi.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat.pl ? page=/npsa/npsa_gor4.html ) ( kloczkowski et al. , ) . gor4 predict protein secondary structure using information theory . \n\n the tertiary structure was built using the galaxy web . galaxyweb server ( http : //galaxy.seoklab.org/ tbm ) is based on the tbm method . this server detects similar proteins and alignment with the target sequence , then make the model and finally perform model refinement ( shin et al. , ) . \n\n tertiary structure refinement and validation \n\n the best-modeled structure was refined using the galaxy refine server at ( http : //galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi ? type=refine ) . galaxy refined the model by molecular dynamics simulation . this method showed one of the best performances in improving protein structure quality . \n\n analysis of the final 3 d model was made using molprobity , prosa and ramachandran plot . ramachandran plot obtained from rampage calculates torsional angles residue-by-residue in protein and indicates that residues are in allowed , favored or outlier regions ( oberholser , ) . prosa web used to recognize the errors in the generated 3 d models using atomic coordinates of the model . prosa web was created z-score ( overall model quality ) and a plot of residue energies of proteins ( wiederstein & sippl , ) . clash analysis is very important for the validation of proteins . molprobity is a structure-validation web service that calculates the clash score , protein-geometry score , poor rotamers , ramachandran plot , and molprobity score . \n\n defining discontinuous b-cell epitopes of designed protein \n\n the interaction between antigen epitopes and antibodies is very essential to eliminate the infection . conformational epitopes are the most important and the most prevalent epitopes that are recognized by antibodies . all conformational epitope prediction methods require the 3 d structures of proteins . discontinuous epitopes of recombinant protein predicted using the ellipro server . this web-based predicts discontinuous epitopes based on protein-antibody interactions . ellipro server predicts conformational and linear b cell epitopes using thornton 's method and by modeller program or blast search of pdb predict and visualize of antibody epitopes ( ponomarenko et al. , ) . \n\n obtaining and preparing the structures of immune receptors and nom recombinant protein \n\n the crystallographic structures of tlr4 ( pdb id : 2z62 ( kim et al. , ) ) and hla-a * 11:01 ( pdb id : 5wjl ( culshaw et al. , 2017 ) ) were obtained from the pdb database ( berman et al. , ) . the structures were cleaned and crystallographic waters and co-crystallized molecules were deleted and only the monomer forms of each receptor were kept . then , the structures of the two receptors and the nom protein were prepared by the dock prep tool in ucsf chimera software ( pettersen et al. , ) where hydrogen atoms and charge were added to the structures to make them ready for the next step . in the next step , to stabilize and relax the structures in an aqueous physiological environment , each of the monomer form of the receptors and the nom protein were simulated for 100 ns . the details of the md simulation will be explained later . \n\n protein-protein molecular docking and refinement \n\n after the md simulation of each receptor and the nom recombinant protein , the last frame of the trajectory of each simulation was extracted and used as the input structures for protein-protein molecular docking . the patchdock webserver ( schneidman-duhovny et al. , ) with default parameters was used to predict the best positions and orientations where the two proteins can have the highest number of favorable interactions . afterward , the top 10 solutions were subjected to firedock webserver ( andrusier et al. , ; mashiach et al. , ) to refine the interaction of protein-protein complexes resulted from molecular docking . the top two complexes from coronavirus nom protein-tlr4 and nom recombinant protein-hla-a * 11:01 complexes were chosen based on global energies . these four complexes were then taken to the next step , md simulation . \n\n molecular dynamics simulation \n\n after performing the protein-protein molecular docking and finding the best orientations of the vaccine candidate and the receptor proteins to interact with one another , the two best-scored complexes were subjected to md simulation . all of the md simulations were done by gromacs 2018 package ( abraham et al. , ) and opls-aa force field ( jorgensen et al. , ) . the monomer form of each protein and also the docked complexes were placed in the center of a triclinic box with a distance of 1 nm from all edges and solvated with tip3p water model ( jorgensen et al. , ) . then , sodium and chloride ions were added to produce a neutral physiological salt concentration of 150 mm . each system was energy minimized , using the steepest descent algorithm , until the fmax was found to be smaller than 10 kj.mol-1nm-1 . all of the covalent bonds were constrained using the linear constraint solver ( lincs ) algorithm ( hess et al. , ) to maintain constant bond lengths . the long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh ewald ( pme ) method ( darden et al. , ; essmann et al. , ) and the cut off radii for coulomb and van der waals short-range interactions were set to 0.9 nm . then 100 ps nvt ( constant number of particles ( n ) , volume ( v ) , and temperature ( t ) ) and 300 ps npt ( constant number of particles ( n ) , pressure ( p ) , and temperature ( t ) ) equilibrations were performed for each system . after the necessary equilibrations , 100 ns of production run were performed for each of the four complexes . finally , simulations were carried out under the periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , set at xyz coordinates to ensure that the atoms had stayed inside the simulation box , and the subsequent analyses were then performed using gromacs utilities , vmd ( humphrey et al. , ) and uscf chimera , and also the plots and the figures were created using daniel 's xl toolbox ( v 7.3.2 ) add-in ( kraus , ) and ezmol ( reynolds et al. , ) . all of the computations were performed on an ubuntu desktop pc , with a [ intel ( r ) xeon ( r ) cpu e5-2630 v3 + nvidia geforce gtx 1080 ] configuration . \n\n mmpbsa binding free energy \n\n the binding free energies of the protein-protein complexes were calculated by molecular mechanics-poisson-boltzmann solvent-accessible surface area , mmpbsa method ( kollman et al. , ) using g_mmpbsa package ( kumari et al. , ) . in this method , the binding free energy is the result of the free energy of the complex minus the sum of the free energies of the ligand and the protein . in our case , the nom recombinant protein is defined as the ligand and the immune receptors are defined as the receptors . the mmpbsa calculation was done for every ns of each simulation trajectories . \n\n results and discussion \n\n defining t-cell epitopes \n\n the results of several studies have shown that strong virus-specific t-cell response is required for the elimination of respiratory virus infections such as sars-cov and influenza a and para-influenza . these studies conclude that future vaccine interventions should also consider strategies to enhance t cell response to provide robust long-term memory ( channappanavar et al. , ; janice oh et al. , ) . studies have shown that high levels of t cell responses against n protein were found 2 years after the patient 's recovery ( peng et al. , ) . antibodies are essential to combat sars-cov infection , and the body needs sars-cov specific cd4+ t helper cells to produce these specific antibodies . also , cd8+ cytotoxic t cells are important for recognizing and killing infected cells , especially in the lungs of infected individuals . we used the rankpep server which covers almost all hla supertypes to predicted different epitops from n , orf3a and m proteins sequence according to hla i and hla ii alleles . antigenic epitopes with high binding affinity score were predicted that are summarized in table 2a-b . \n\n antigen hla_a0201 hla_a0204 hla_a0206 hla_b0702 hla_b51 hla_b5401 hla_b5301 nucleocapsid protein 316-324 299-307 66-74 343-351 66-74 45-53 gmsrigmev

to the t cell-mediated immunity . while cytotoxic lymphocytes can kill infected cells , antibodies have the potential to eliminate infected cells and prevent the infectious virus from infecting a cell ( neutralization ) . sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies block viral entry ( dorner & radbruch , ; hsueh et al. , ) . in this study , for the linear epitope prediction , the bepipred server was employed . bepipred analysis revealed several continuous predicted epitopes of n , orf3a and m proteins . for cross-checking the predicted epitopes , the sequence of all three proteins was also predicted by kolaskar & tongaonkar antigenicity . the linear b-cell epitopes are represented in ( table 3 ) . given that both cellular and humoral immune responses are essential against coronaviruses infection ( janice oh et al. , ) , finally , epitopes that were shared between b cell and t-cell were selected . \n\n selected targets for designing the final vaccine \n\n the main strategy in the present study was to design and construct a novel multi-epitope protein from covid-19 based on in silico methods to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses . due to the low immunogenicity of the epitope , we chose epitope-rich domains to generate a more diverse and robust response ( wieser et al. , ) . based on in silico analysis , five epitope-rich domains including highly scored and shared epitopes between t and b-cell epitopes were selected and joined to each other with a three aaa linker ( table 4 ) . the schematic diagram of designed vaccine domains with linker 's sites has been shown in figure 2 . \n\n the schematic diagram of the vaccine candidate construct consists of n , orf3a and m proteins epitopes of the covid-19 linked together with aaa linkers . \n\n antigen server

allergenicity \n\n prediction of the vaccine candidate antigenicity represents a numerical criterion for the capability of the vaccine to bind to the b- and t-cell receptors and increase the immune response in the host cell . vaxijen v2.0 was used to predict the antigenicity of the designed protein . vaxijen analysis of nom protein showed potent antigenicity 0.5999 with a 0.4 % threshold . the results indicate that the designed protein sequences without adjuvant are antigenic . \n\n allergen proteins induce an ige antibody response ( dimitrov et al. , ) . the designed vaccine candidate must not show an allergic reaction to the body . the allergenicity of the sequence was predicted using the allertop tool . based on prediction approaches in allertop , this protein was not recognized as an allergen . \n\n the physicochemical parameters and protein secondary structure prediction \n\n primary structure analysis nom designed protein ( 337 aa ) has a molecular weight of 37513.57 d. the total number of positively charged residues ( arg + lys ) and negatively charged residues ( asp + glu ) were 19 and 32 respectively . the theoretical isoelectric point ( pi ) was calculated at 9.62 . the instability index ( < 40 ) indicates that the designed protein has high stability for the initiation of an immunogenic reaction . the instability index ( ii ) was 35.75 which classifies the protein as stable . the aliphatic index of nom recombinant protein was calculated 97.92 and indicates this protein has stability in several temperatures . \n\n natively unfolded protein regions and alpha-helix are important forms of structural antigens that can be arranged in their native structure and thus identified by antibodies that are produced in response to infection . ( shey et al. , ) . the composition of the predicted secondary structure of the nom multi-epitope vaccine candidate was 43.92 % ( alpha helix ) , 16.02 % ( extended strand ) , and 40.06 % ( random coil ) . all this information indicates the designed protein is suitable as a vaccine candidate . \n\n tertiary structure prediction and validation \n\n three-dimensional structure was modeled by galaxyweb for our designed protein ( figure 3a ) . this model was used for evaluation and refinement . for validation of the model , prosa-web , ramachandran plot and molprobity were used that compare and analyze the protein structure . the prosa web determined z-score for the best predicted 3 d model ( figure 3b ) . the z-score of the nom predicted model was -4.42 , which is within the range of scores typically found for native proteins of similar size . the ramachandran plot indicates that most of the residues are found in the favored and allowed regions ( 99.7 % ) and only 0.3 % in the outlier region , this shows that the quality of the designed model is satisfactory . phe 282 , asn311 , tyr228 , lys194 , asp223 , ser229 , ser4 , his197 , tyr68 residues were observed in the allowed and outlier regions of ramachandran plot ( figure 3c ) . in molprobity analysis , the all-atom clash score was 9.37 , the molprobity score was 2.21 . all structural images were created using pymol ( the pymol molecular graphics system , version 1.1 , schrodinger , llc ) . \n\n ( a-c ) prediction and validation of tertiary structure of the nom recombinant protein using ( a ) prediction of the

b-cell epitopes from the 3 d structure of nom recombinant protein . discontinuous b-cell epitopes were predicted with scores ranging from0.679 to 0.945 . amino acid residues , the number of residues , sequence location as well as their scores have been listed in tables 5 . the graphical representation of the discontinuous epitopes has been displayed in figure 4 . \n\n three-dimensional

conformational b-cell epitopes from vaccine protein using ellipro server . \n\n establishing the stability of the initial structures \n\n a vaccine can interact with different receptors of the immune system . we have docked designed final constructs ( nom ) with tlr4 and hla-a * 11:01 receptors . the interaction between these receptors and nom recombinant protein induce different immune responses . to achieve a stable and relaxed state of the nom recombinant protein and the immune receptors , a md simulation of 100 ns was performed for each structure . these simulations ensure that the structures are stable enough to be used for protein-protein molecular docking . after 100 ns of the production run , as it is shown in figure 5 , the rmsd ( root mean square distance ) values of the monomers show that the backbone structure of tlr4 ( pdb id : 2z62 ) is very rigid and stable . the structure of the nom recombinant protein also reached stability after about 25 ns after a considerable structural change . the backbone structure of the hla-a * 11:01 ( pdb id : 5wjl ) , however , showed big spikes in the rmsd values but all three structures were visually inspected and were considered stable enough for the next step of the project . \n\n the rmsd values of the simulated monomer forms of the proteins throughput the 100 ns of production runs . \n\n protein-protein molecular docking \n\n to find the best orientation for optimal interaction of the nom protein with the immune receptors we decided to use protein-protein molecular docking . we used patchdock webserver which concentrates on recognizing and matching patterns of the surfaces of the proteins to put them in the best possible positions . afterward , the top 10 best solutions were subjected to the firedock webserver to refine the docked structures . the firedock algorithms refine the docked complexes by side-chain rearrangement and soft rigid-body optimization . the ranking of the docked complexes is based on short-range , long-range , attractive and repulsive interaction energies between the residues of the two proteins , which are all summed up in the global energy or the binding energy of the complexes . we considered global energy as the main criterion for choosing the best complexes and chose the two top-scored solutions with the best global energy . as it is shown in table 6 , the solution numbers 5 and 6 from the nom-tlr4 complex and the solution numbers 2 and 3 , from nom-hla-a * 11:01 complex , were chosen for further calculations . the total energy plots of the simulations are shown in figure 6 . the results showed a strong interaction between designed protein amino acids and receptors . the interactions between the binding receptors and the docked nom protein were visualized using the ucsf chimera program . residues of hla-a * 1101 ( glu53 , asn174 , gly56 , asn174 , glu53 , pro57 ) participated in the interaction with arg49 , ser97 , gln91 , met102 , arg49 and gln91 residues of the candidate vaccine . also , nine residues of tlr4 ( tlr4 lys123 , ile319 , thr66 , ser90 , lys124 , lys46 , his85 , lys123 ) participated in the interaction with ser45 , glu199 , gln91 , ala84 , met328 , gln65 , ser90 , glu68 residues of the designed candidate vaccine . \n\n the total energy plots of the simulations . \n\n complex no of solution glob

simulation of top scored solutions \n\n after the protein-protein molecular docking , 4 solutions were chosen for md simulation , solution numbers 2 and 3 from nom protein-hla-a * 11:01 complex and solution numbers 5 and 6 from nom protein-tlr4 complex . each was simulated for 100 ns . to examine their stability throughout the simulations period , the rmsd values of each protein was analyzed . as it is shown in figure 7 , each protein has different rmsd values and in some of them , the backbone atoms have considerable movements during the simulations . the reason is that the interactions can get optimized and rearranged by introducing water molecules and physiological conditions . the rmsd values of tlr4 in nom protein-tlr4 complexes and the values of hla-a * 11:01 in nom protein-hla-a * 11:01 complexes are very stable and the average values do not reach very high values . however , the rmsd values of the nom protein in every complex reach high values which means that the structure of the vaccine has more movements to refine the interactions with the immune receptors . however , the interactions between the nom recombinant protein and the immune receptors are quite strong and mmpbsa binding energy calculations exhibit great binding energies . as it is shown in table 7 , the van der waals and electrostatic energies of the complexes are strong enough to keep the two proteins in contact with each other . moreover , the deviation of each value is very small which means that the interactions are very stable and consistent throughout the simulations . in another word , the higher scale of rmsd values with consistent binding energies only show that the structure of the nom protein is well optimized for interacting with the immune receptors . \n\n the rmsd

cfvlaavyrinwitggiaiamaclvglmwlsyfiasf \n\n five epitope-rich domains were selected \n\n in addition to the analysis described above , to analyze the fluctuations of the backbone atoms of structures of the proteins , we decided to perform rmsf ( root mean square fluctuation ) analysis . in this analysis , the average value of fluctuation of each residue during the simulation is plotted , figure 8 . as it is shown in figure 8a , the rmsf values of nom recombinant protein in five simulations indicate that the fluctuation of the monomer form of the vaccine in many regions is considerably more than the complex forms . this is a direct indication that the nom recombinant protein is much more stable when it is in complex with the two immune receptors . furthermore , the rmsf values of the nom recombinant protein in complex with hla-a * 11:01 are lower compared with that of nom recombinant protein in complex with tlr4 . also , with the evidence that the binding energies are also lower , we can conclude that nom recombinant protein can bind to the hla-a * 11:01 better than the other immune receptor . \n\n the rmsf values of each protein in the simulated complexes compared to the simulated monomer forms of the proteins throughout the 100 ns of production runs . a , the comparison of the rmsf values of nom recombinant protein in the complexes with the monomer form . b , the

the graphical illustration of the monomer forms and the complex forms of the nom recombinant protein and the hla-a * 11:01 and tlr4 immune receptors . \n\n in figure 8b and figure 8c , the rmsf values of the monomer forms of the immune receptors show lower values compared to the complex forms . this behavior is exactly the opposite of the nom designed protein . this can be an indication that the structures are very stable in their natural function and their structures considerably change when they get into contact with the designed nom protein . furthermore , the structural illustration of the monomer forms and also the complex forms of the vaccine and the immune receptors , figure 9 , shows that the vaccine can fill the cavities and bind tightly to them , as it was proved by the binding energies . \n\n conclusion \n\n covid-19 pandemic is much more than a health crisis . it leads to a political , social and economic crisis in the world . the development of a safe and effective vaccine could reduce the rate of this infection . immunoinformatics methods are valuable in reducing time and cost in vaccine design and other fields of life sciences . we have predicted and validated nom recombinant protein against hla-a * 11:01 and tlr4 receptors . our evaluation was based on vaccine candidate structural analysis and molecular docking and md simulations study . the nom-tlr4 and nom-hla-a * 11:01 complexes were very stable in their natural function with strong molecular interactions in around 100 ns . higher binding energy even after the md simulation of 100 ns confirmed the stability and specificity nom-tlr4 and nom- hla-a * 11:01 interaction . our vaccine candidate can stimulate both cellular and humoral immunity , given that b and t-cell epitopes have been selected in the final construct . taken all together , according to physicochemical evaluations as well as structural and immunological analyses , nom recombinant protein could be considered as a possible vaccine candidate against covid-19 . \n\n acknowledgements \n\n this work was supported by the hormozgan university of medical sciences under grant [ number : hums-rec.1398.647 ] , bandar

attention from medical personnel and patients . \n\n non-invasive respiratory support plays an essential role in the treatment of covid-19 . more awareness is needed of viral transmission through exhaled air . http : //bit.ly/39knrrf \n\n to the editor : \n\n as of 17 february , 2020 , china has 70 635 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , including 1772 deaths . human-to-human spread of the virus via respiratory droplets is currently considered to be the main route of transmission . however , exhaled air dispersion during non-invasive respiratory support may increase the risk of coronavirus transmission , and requires more attention from medical personnel and patients . \n\n according to the chinese centre for disease control and prevention , among 72 314 reported cases in mainland china ( 44 672 confirmed cases , 16 186 suspected cases , 10 567 clinically diagnosed cases , and 889 asymptomatic infected cases ) as of 11 february , 1716 medical staff were infected . notably , wang et al . analysed the clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalised cases with covid-19 and found that the nosocomial infection rate in the study was about 41.3 % , with 17 inpatients and 40 medical staff . given the high use of respiratory support to treat dyspnoea and respiratory failure induced by covid-19 , viral transmission through exhaled air should be considered . \n\n when oxygen is delivered through nasal catheter , mask or non-invasive ventilation ( niv ) , substantial exhaled air is released into the air , which can increase dispersion of the virus , and subsequently increase the risk of nosocomial infection . prior studies have suggested that the application of high-flow nasal cannula ( hfnc ) , niv through the specific mask with optimised vent holes or the helmet with a double-limb circuit may lower the risk of airborne transmission . performing non-invasive respiratory support in a single , well-ventilated , negative pressure ward is also considered a safe option . currently , however , the majority of patients are still receiving respiratory support through nasal catheter or common mask in general wards or emergency departments with limited medical resources . the potential for airborne transmission in this population has not received enough attention . furthermore , a significant proportion of suspected patients with mild to no symptoms who are managing at home may also require long-term home oxygen or niv treatment ( e.g . patients with advanced staged copd ) . these patients may increase the risk of family cluster infections by the widespread dispersion of exhaled air in their homes . \n\n non-invasive respiratory support plays an essential role in the treatment of covid-19 , and more awareness is needed regarding the increased risk of viral transmission from exhaled air . medical staff should utilise personal protective equipment when providing respiratory support therapy . patients should wear a medical mask when receiving conventional oxygen therapy or hfnc in order to reduce air dispersion . when performing niv therapy , because helmet resources are limited and they are not frequently used in routine clinical practice , we suggest avoiding masks with vent holes and adding a filter between the mask and the vent valve to reduce viral transmission . patient beds should be at least 1 m from one another and the ward air circulation rate needs to be increased . for patients with suspected covid-19 infection receiving long-term respiratory support at home , it is recommended that they stay in a single , well-ventilated room to avoid potentially infecting their family members . \n\n shareable pdf \n\n conflict of interest : l. guan has nothing to disclose .

00010010	early in the epidemic : impact of preprints on global discourse about covid-19 transmissibility \n\n since it was first reported by who in jan 5 , 2020 , over 80 000 cases of a novel coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) have been diagnosed in china , with exportation events to nearly 90 countries , as of march 6 , 2020 . given the novelty of the causative pathogen ( named sars-cov-2 ) , scientists have rushed to fill epidemiological , virological , and clinical knowledge gaps : resulting in over 50 new studies about the virus between january 10 and january 30 alone . however , in an era where the immediacy of information has become an expectation of decision makers and the general public alike , many of these studies have been shared first in the form of preprint papers : before peer review . \n\n for the past three decades , preprint servers have become commonplace in the scientific publication ecosystem , and covid-19 has prompted a seemingly unprecedented use of these platforms . although peer-review is crucial for the validation of science , the ongoing outbreak has showcased the speed with which preprints can disseminate information during emergencies . in this comment , we used both preprint and peer-reviewed studies that estimated the transmissibility potential ( ie , basic reproduction number [ r 0 ] ) of sars-cov-2 on or before feb 1 , 2020 to investigate the role that preprints have had in information dissemination during the ongoing outbreak . we also analysed the agreement of preprint estimates compared with those presented by peer-reviewed studies and propose a consensus-based approach for evaluating the validity of preprint findings during public health crises . for our analysis , we collected publicly available data from scientific studies , news reports , and search trends pertaining to sars-cov-2 and its r 0 . defined as the average number of secondary infections that a new case might transmit in a fully susceptible population , estimates of r 0 can provide decision makers with insights into the epidemic potential of a given outbreak . \n\n relevant news reports were discovered through mediacloud and search trends by use of google search trends , and both served as a proxy indicator for information dissemination . meanwhile , relevant scientific studies were discovered through a combination of searches executed with use of google scholar and , to address possible delays in indexing , four popular public preprint servers ( ie , arxiv , biorxiv , medrxiv , and social science research network [ ssrn ] ) that we believe are representative of the relevant preprint literature . search terms and specifications for each data source are outlined in the appendix ( p 2 ) . all studies discovered through google scholar , arxiv , biorxiv , medrxiv , and ssrn were manually checked for relevance to the topic area of interest . we retained only studies that included estimates for the r 0 associated with sars-cov-2 in the body of the text . \n\n r0 mean and range estimates from 11 different studies of covid-19 as a function of time \n\n for preprints that were revised before publication of the first relevant peer-reviewed study on jan 29 , the version number is indicated between parentheses as ( n ) . when multiple r0 estimates were presented in a single study because of the use of multiple approaches , the version number is followed by a single decimal place to indicate the approach used ( n.n ) . if a first author published more than one relevant independent study before feb 1 , the version number is followed immediately by an alphabetical marker ordered by date of publication ( nx ) . ranges presented vary by study ( eg , 95 % ci , 95 % credible interval , and so on ) and are presented in the appendix ( p 3 ) . r0=basic reproduction number . \n\n after this initial data discovery phase , which yielded 11 individual studies , date of first publication , publication platform , review status ( ie , preprint vs peer-reviewed ) , and methodological details were manually curated from each study ( appendix p 3 ) . r 0 estimates were also extracted from each study for further analysis . in the event of multiple r 0 estimates : because of preprint revisions after the first version or the use of multiple approaches in a single study : each estimate was recorded and treated as a separate entry to represent all available knowledge at any given point in time ( appendix p 3 ) . given that the first known preprint estimates for r 0 were posted to ssrn by us on jan 23 , we plotted search trend fractions and news report volume between jan 23 and feb 1 ( appendix p 4 ) . baseline data for both sources before jan 23 , 2020 , yielded negligible search trend interest and news report volume , and data collected up to feb 9 , 2020 , showed diminishing interest and volume after the catchment window ( appendix p 4 ) . to illustrate when each of the 11 relevant studies became available to the public , indicator bars were overlaid against the search trend and news report data by date of publication ( appendix p 4 ) . we then plotted each of the 16 r 0 estimates produced by the 11 studies , including both the mean and the estimate range ( eg , 95 % ci , 95 % credible interval , and so on ) presented ( appendix p 3 ) . estimates were plotted by date of publication and alphabetically there-in , offering a side-by-side comparison of preprint versus peer-reviewed results ; averages and 95 % cis were also computed for both groups ( figure ) . \n\n google search trends and mediacloud data suggested that both general ( ie , search ) interest and news media interest in the r 0 associated with covid-19 peaked before the publication of relevant peer-reviewed studies during the early stages of the epidemic . in the selected time frame , search interest peaked on jan 27 after a sharp increase between jan 23 and jan 25 immediately after the publication of five early preprint studies : all of which estimated r 0 : in biorxiv , medrxiv , and ssrn . meanwhile , news media interest peaked on jan 28 , coinciding with a sixth preprint study published in arxiv ( appendix p 4 ) . the first peer-reviewed estimates were then published by li and colleagues in the new england journal of medicine on jan 29 at 17:00 h ( eastern standard time ) , followed by four additional peer-reviewed studies in eurosurveillance , the international journal of infectious diseases , the lancet , and journal of clinical medicine up to feb 1 . average r 0 estimates across the preprint group were 3 61 ( 95 % ci 2 77-4 45 ) and 2 54 ( 2 17-2 91 ) across the peer-reviewed group : showing overlap in 95 % cis despite a wide diversity of modelling methods and data sources used both in-group and across-group ( appendix p 3 ) . although the average mean for the preprint group was higher than that for the peer-reviewed group , this effect was driven primarily by two upper-limit outlier estimates ( with r 0 higher than the 95 % ci maximum ; figure ) . exclusion of these two estimates by use of a consensus-based approach based on the 95 % cis yielded an average r 0 estimate of 3 02 ( 95 % ci 2 65-3 39 ) for the preprint group . notably , two studies in the peer-reviewed group had previously been published as preprints . although estimates presented by riou and althaus remained unchanged after peer review , estimates presented by zhao and colleagues were higher before peer review than afterwards . \n\n our findings suggest that , because of the speed of their release , preprints : rather than peer-reviewed literature in the same topic area : might be driving discourse related to the ongoing covid-19 outbreak . although our analysis focused on search trends and news media data as a measure for general discourse , it is likely that preprints are also influencing policy making discussions , given that who announced on jan 26 , 2020 , that they would be creating a repository of relevant studies : including those that have not yet been peer-reviewed . \n\n nevertheless , despite the advantages of speedy information delivery , the lack of peer review can also translate into issues of credibility and misinformation , both intentional and unintentional . this particular drawback has been highlighted during the ongoing outbreak , especially after the high-profile withdrawal of a virology study from the preprint server biorxiv , which erroneously claimed that covid-19 contained hiv `` insertions '' . the very fact that this study was withdrawn showcases the power of open peer-review during emergencies ; the withdrawal itself appears to have been prompted by outcry from dozens of scientists from around the globe who had access to the study because it was placed on a public server . much of this outcry was documented on twitter ( a microblogging platform ) and on longer-form popular science blogs , signalling that such fora would serve as rich additional data sources for future work on the impact of preprints on public discourse . however , instances such as this one described showcase the need for caution when acting upon the science put forth by any one preprint . \n\n with this in mind , taking multiple studies into consideration as presented in our analysis can help operationalise the kind of caution necessitated by preprints while simultaneously allowing for important , robust insights before the publication of a peer-reviewed study in the same topic area . here , we used a simple method in which we plotted the ten r 0 estimates that were posted as preprints before publication of the first peer-reviewed study on jan 29 ; we then took the average of these estimates and excluded the two estimates that qualified as upper-limit outliers : both upon visual inspection and as a function of the 95 % ci . even before outlier elimination , this simple method yielded average r 0 estimates similar to those presented by the peer-reviewed studies subsequently published on and after jan 29 ; however , more complex approaches that incorporate weighted averages based on estimate confidence , similar to traditional meta-analytical methods , offer a promising avenue for future work . such collective , consensus-based approaches will arguably be easiest to use when the research of interest is quantitative in nature ; nevertheless , given that many crucial epidemiological parameters that inform decision making ( eg , incubation period , generation time , and so on ) are quantitative , our proposed approach could work well in these contexts as well . \n\n our work showcases the powerful role preprints can have during public health crises because of the timeliness with which they can disseminate new information . furthermore , given that two of the preprints included in this analysis were later published in peer-reviewed outlets , the evidence shows that that even prestigious journals now permit the sharing of important findings before peer review and that the use of preprint platforms does not jeopardise future peer-reviewed publication . without question , primacy and peer-reviewed publications are key metrics in individual professional advancement ( eg , academic promotion ) ; nevertheless , the impact of preprints on discourse and decision making pertaining to the ongoing covid-19 outbreak suggests that we must rethink how we reward and recognise community contributions during present and future public health crises . \n\n references \n\n\n\n

01100000	potential cytoprotective activity of ozone therapy in sars-cov-2/covid-19 . \n\n ( 1 ) background : the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) disease ( covid-19 ) in china at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak . systemic ozone therapy ( ot ) could be potentially useful in the clinical management of several complications secondary to sars-cov-2 . the rationale and mechanism of action has already been proven clinically in other viral infections and has been shown in research studies to be highly effective at decreasing organ damage mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress . this review summarizes the ot studies that illustrate the possible cytoprotective mechanism of action of ozone and its physiological by-products in target organs affected by sars-cov-2 . ( 2 ) methods : this review encompasses a total of 74 peer-reviewed original articles . it is mainly focused on ozone as a modulator of the nf-kappa b/nrf2 pathways and il-6/il-1beta expression . ( 3 ) results : in experimental models and the few existent clinical studies , homeostasis of the free radical and antioxidant balance by ot was associated with a modulation of nf-kappa b/nrf2 balance and il-6 and il-1beta expression . these molecular mechanisms support the cytoprotective effects of ot against tissue damage present in many inflammatory diseases , including viral infections . ( 4 ) conclusions : the potential cytoprotective role of ot in the management of organ damage induced by covid-19 merits further research . controlled clinical trials are needed . 
01001000	perspective from ecuador , the second country with more confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in south america : a review \n\n to face the pandemic outbreak of a novel coronavirus many countries developed a series of containment methods ; however , developing countries in south america had reacted apathetically to this worldwide concern . ecuador 's response to the novel virus coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) started on february 26 , 2020 , one month after the outbreak began in china . as of today , the countries with more confirmed cases in south america are brazil and ecuador . although brazil has two times the number of cases than ecuador ( brazil : 700 cases per 100000 people vs. ecuador : 400 cases per 100000 ) , the huge population difference between the two countries raises concerns about the public health policies implemented by the ecuadorian government . even though there is no cure for covid-19 , chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are promising alternatives . the covid-19 pandemic outbreak has shown that there is room for improvement in the healthcare systems worldwide and the disastrous results on the fragile often unprepared are those systems in developing countries . \n\n introduction and background \n\n alarm bells over the world started to ring after the news regarding a case of pneumonia caused by a novel virus in wuhan , china . the virus supposedly originated in one of the largest markets in wuhan . on january 7 , 2020 , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) isolated the virus and called it severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) . the disease caused by this virus was named coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) by the world health organization ( who ) . \n\n even though the majority of cases present with flu-like symptoms , 3.4 % of patients develop severe pneumonia , septic shock , respiratory failure , and multiorgan failure leading to a fatal outcome . \n\n on january 30 , 2020 , the who declared the covid-19 outbreak a global health emergency . countries applied many measures , hoping to contain the spread of the disease ; for example , restricting mobility and quarantines . additionally , incoming flights from countries with a high prevalence of the disease were suspended , first from china and then followed by italy and spain . \n\n in south america , brazil is the country with the highest number of covid-19-confirmed cases followed by ecuador . although brazil has two times the number of cases than ecuador , it is important to analyze the prevalence of the disease in the context of the countries ' population . while brazil , with a population of 212,559,417 , has a total of 1,549 confirmed cases ( 0.007 % ) ; ecuador , with a population of 17,567,751 , has 789 confirmed cases ( 0.004 % ) . the greater ratio of cases per population in ecuador raises the concern about the efficacy of the containment measures and public health policies taken by the country . \n\n the limitations of the healthcare systems in developing countries increase their chances of being affected more during a pandemic outbreak . \n\n review \n\n confirmed cases and ecuadorian response \n\n after the announcement that covid-19 was spreading rapidly across asian countries , european countries went into an alarm state and started to design containment measures while south american countries reacted apathetically , delaying decisions on preventive measures , underestimating the severity of the events . \n\n ecuador 's response to the novel virus covid-19 started on february 26 , 2020 . the set of measures included monitoring the temperature and other covid-19-related symptoms in travelers from high-risk countries . on february 29 , 2020 , ecuador confirmed the first case of covid-19 . the patient had arrived from spain two weeks before the diagnosis was made . \n\n after the who declared covid-19 as a pandemic outbreak on march 11 , 2020 , ecuador declared a national health emergency . all non-essential activities were suspended indefinitely and the use of virtual platforms was encouraged for academic activities , jobs , and medical care . as did other countries did , ecuador also closed its land , air , and sea borders to citizens and non-citizens for 21 days . restrictions to vehicular or pedestrian traffic and a national curfew from 7 pm to 5 am also took place . \n\n despite these measures , the virus continued spreading across the ecuadorian provinces . on march 23 , 2020 , 789 confirmed patients with covid-19 and 18 deaths related to the virus were reported by the ministry of health of ecuador . the mortality rate was similar to other countries . the number of confirmed patients increased , so did the number of people in epidemiological monitoring and quarantine . \n\n the infection risk in physicians also increases in countries with a high prevalence of sars-cov-2 . in italy , more than 3,000 health providers were infected becoming an increasing concern among health providers worldwide . in ecuador , 24 doctors have been tested positive for the virus one month after the first patient 's admission with covid-19 . the rising number of physicians testing positive for covid-19 raises concern amid a growing outcry over the shortage of protective equipment and medical supplies . \n\n guayas , with 607 confirmed cases , is by far the most affected province by covid-19 in ecuador . measures applied in the rest of the country with relative success failed in this province . the out-of-control increase in confirmed cases poses the risk of collapsing the health care system there . this situation led the government to declare the province as a national security zone , leaving operational planning to the army . \n\n transmission \n\n the transmission was described as animal-to-person in affected patients at the huanan seafood wholesale market of wuhan . at the moment , person-to-person transmission and fomite transmission have been linked with the spread of the illness . li compiled information on the dynamics of the novel virus , estimating a transmission rate of r0 2.2 for covid-19 . in addition , cascella mentions that close contact with an infected person is needed to transmit the virus . therefore , relatives and health professionals are at greater risk . \n\n there are some discrepancies about the transmission . while some studies support the animal-to-human transmission , including a case of a pet that tested positive for covid-19 , the cdc states that there is no evidence that pets can transmit the virus or present the symptomology of infection . \n\n prevention \n\n the main goal in the control of a pandemic outbreak is to achieve r0 less than 1 ( one positive patient can infect less than one extra person ) . to reach this goal , prevention is paramount . \n\n the who and cdc recommend avoiding contact with symptomatic people and agglomerations . basic hygiene practices , such as constant hand washing and the use of face masks in symptomatic patients , are also recommended to prevent the spread of the virus . \n\n many countries utilized quarantine and mobilization restrictions to control the spread ; however , these measures may not be sufficient in developing countries such as ecuador . \n\n pathophysiology \n\n the cause of covid-19 is a ribonucleic acid ( rna ) virus of the coronaviridae family called sars-cov-2 . although the exact pathophysiology of sars-cov-2 is unknown , its structural similarity with other viruses of the coronaviridae family allows an understanding of its dynamics and the evolution of the disease . the clinical presentation may vary from flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia similar to sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n channappanavar and granlinski mention that the most aggressive strains of the coronavirinae family , like sars-cov , have protein e in their envelope that stimulates nf-kb , a protein complex involved in cellular responses , including stress , cytokine signaling , response to viral infections , and apoptosis . protein e , along with other proteins , interferes with the host immune response ( tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) alpha and interleukin 6 ( il-6 ) ) . these processes produce uncontrolled inflammation , resulting in lung edema and fibrosis . \n\n treatment \n\n efforts to control covid-19 had been made by many countries , starting with investigations to develop a vaccine from the attenuated or inactive virus . the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases announced the beginning of the first trial on 45 volunteers between 18 and 55 years old . this first phase is estimated to last for six weeks . the kaiser research institute is evaluating the feasibility of the mrna-1723 vaccine . \n\n the management of patients with acute respiratory syndrome consists of assisted oxygen ventilation to achieve a saturation percentage of oxygen ( spo2 ) of 90 % and antipyretics . \n\n multiple drugs are being studied to treat covid-19 , with promising results . in the united states and china , a randomized clinical trial has been initiated to test the efficacy of remdesivir . at the moment , oseltamivir , a neuraminidase inhibitor , has been used more extensively . \n\n chloroquine , a drug used worldwide , has a promising effect in the treatment of severe pneumonia by covid-19 at a dose of 500 mg2 times a day ; however , zhou questions its use due to its side effects . instead of using chloroquine , zhou suggests hydroxychloroquine as an alternative treatment . hydroxychloroquine seems to attenuate the progression to more severe scenarios of covd-19 infection , although its dosage still needs further study . \n\n conclusions \n\n the low mortality of covid-19 may be the reason for developing countries underestimating the magnitude of this pandemic outbreak . the health care systems risk collapsing due to the increasing number of confirmed patients who need intensive care and the spread of the disease in health providers . the high demand for financial and human resources by this disease leads to a collateral increase in mortality from other causes . the covid-19 pandemic outbreak has shown that there is still room for improvement in healthcare systems worldwide to prevent its catastrophic impact , especially on the fragile and often unprepared systems in developing countries . \n\n the authors have declared that no competing interests exist . \n\n references \n\n cnn . ? cual es la tasa de mortalidad del coronavirus ?

10000000	multistage ct features of coronavirus disease 2019 . \n\n objectives : to determine imaging features of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in different stages , and to provide foundations for early diagnosis and treatment . methods : ct image data of 187 covid-19 patients were analyzed in the period of hospitalization . ct scanning was performed on admission and repeated every 3 days . the improvement time of clinical symptoms and the image changes of follow-up ct were statistically analyzed . results : all 187 patients ' nucleic acid test were positive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) . the early ct images of lung in 187 cases ( 100 % ) showed multiple patchy and ground-glass opacities with fine mesh and consolidation shade , which mainly distributed in pulmonary band or under the pleura . in the progressive stage , the pulmonary lesions in 146 cases ( 78.1 % ) were mainly consolidation , accompanied by air bronchogram , thickening of blood vessels , and interstitial changes . severe pulmonary ct images in 15 cases ( 8 % ) showed diffuse lesions in both lungs , displaying consolidation , or `` white lung '' . the ct imaging features in 185 cases ( 98.9 % ) at the absorptive period showed that the lesions diminished and fibrogenesis . the imaging features of 6 times of lung ct examination in one case showed continuous progress . the original lesion in one case was obviously absorbed , but new lesions appeared under the pleura of both lungs at the third review of ct scanning . the changes of ct imaging lesions during follow-up were significantly different in different clinical symptoms improvement time ( p < 0.01 ) . conclusions : images of covid-19 in various stages have special characteristics . the change of clinical symptoms is synchronous with the change of reexamination ct . follow-up ct can reflect the trend of clinical changes . repeat ct examination plays an important role in the early clinical diagnosis and the evaluation for the therapeutic effect on covid-19 patient .

00000100	covid-19 pneumonia with hemoptysis : acute segmental pulmonary emboli associated with novel coronavirus infection . \n\n recent retrospective studies from wuhan , china suggest novel coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) may be associated with a hypercoagulable state and increased risk for venous thromboembolism . the overlap in the signs and symptoms of covid-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) and covid-19 with concurrent pulmonary embolism creates a diagnostic challenge for emergency medicine physicians in patients already at risk for renal impairment . however , identifying features atypical for covid-19 alone may play a role in the judicious use of computed tomography angiography among these patients . hemoptysis is seen in roughly 13 % of pulmonary embolism cases and infrequently reported among covid-19 infections . additionally , the presence of right heart strain on electrocardiography ( ekg ) is a well described clinical presentations of pulmonary embolism not reported commonly with covid-19 infections . 
00000001	a uk-wide british society of thoracic imaging covid-19 imaging repository and database : design , rationale and implications for education and research \n\n introduction \n\n the number of cases of covid-19 continues to rise in the uk and around the world . the precise role for computed tomography ( ct ) in the diagnosis and triage of suspected cases , assessing for complications , and surveillance is subject to change and are explored in other articles in this edition ; however , keeping the uk diagnostic community fully informed of emerging guidance during the covid-19 outbreak is critical . this can be achieved as a collaborative effort by feeding a central library of the medical examples encountered and rapidly sharing expert opinions to frontline medical care staff , nationally and internationally . \n\n the british society of thoracic imaging ( bsti ) , in conjunction with cimar uk 's imaging cloud technology ( cimar.co.uk ) , have designed , built , and deployed a simple , free to use , anonymised , and encrypted online portal to upload and refer imaging of patients with either confirmed or suspected covid-19 . from these cases , the bsti are providing an imaging database of known uk patient examples for reference and teaching . the aim is to disseminate breaking clinical and diagnostic advice rapidly to frontline healthcare staff nationally , using real imaging examples encountered across the country . \n\n all imaging and supporting data are stored at uk cloud ( https : //ukcloudhealth.com ) with no identifiable metadata . imaging can be uploaded at http : //bit.ly/bsticovid19_database . the published teaching library and its content will be accessible without a login via the bsti website ( https : //bit.ly/bsticovid19_teaching_library ) . \n\n the role of registries in radiology \n\n registry data can be essential in the development of radiology diagnosis and shared learning . they have sometimes changed practice , for example , the identification of high rates of morbidity in patients undergoing emergency biliary procedures via the swedish registry gallriks , and complications in vascular surgery via vascular registries . \n\n the royal college of radiologists document `` setting up a regional or national digital teaching archive '' makes clear that such databases are needed for developing the knowledge and skills of radiology trainees , but would also significantly benefit trained radiologists . this is perhaps even more pertinent in the face of a new virus whose imaging features can be varied and unfamiliar . indeed , it has long been recognised that breaking down technological barriers to contributing imaging studies directly from a picture archiving and communications system ( pacs ) viewer to a central imaging repository would make teaching and research in the national health service ( nhs ) more efficient and accurate . overcoming such a bottleneck would also deliver the potential to exponentially upskill the radiology workforce in the early and accurate diagnosis of covid-19 , in what is currently a highly dynamic situation . by bringing together thoracic ct expertise across the uk , a central covid-19 imaging repository and database can help reduce unwarranted diagnostic variation , provide better quality care for patients , and provide a resource to accumulate knowledge rapidly . such a database would also allow real-time tracking of confirmed ct cases and allow improved understanding of the significance of cases with positive ct findings , but negative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( rt-pcr ) results . this will help collate valuable information for the nhs and public health england . \n\n technical aspects and registry design \n\n refer a case ( upload link ) : https : //bit.ly/bsticovid19_database . \n\n teaching library access : https : //bit.ly/bsticovid19_teaching_library . \n\n the platform is provided free of cost by cimar.co.uk , a uk-hosted cloud-pacs and image sharing service , ( powered by ambra health inc. technology ) . more than 9 billion images are hosted globally by this cloud , across 55 countries , connecting thousands of hospitals and imaging sites for over 700 clinical trials . the service is increasingly used by the nhs to solve imaging storage , interoperability , and rapid sharing needs . referred cases can be uploaded from any hospital or location . they will then be routed through a restricted access workflow to a panel of bsti diagnostic experts for approval and annotation , prior to general access to healthcare professionals being granted . all cases will be automatically anonymised by the cloud-software at the point of upload and access does not require changes to individual/organisation firewalls . all connections are secure and encrypted ( https/tls1.2 ) . no hardware is required . \n\n users can view the published teaching library , diagnostic observations , and training materials online using chrome , firefox , safari , apple or pc machines , as well as any other browser or mobile device . a diagnostic food and drug administration ( fda ) approved html5 viewer loads automatically for the user , so no special software , downloads , or installations are required to access and use the resource . \n\n the requirement for data protection impact assessment ( dpia ) forms will be the decision of each individual trust ; however , completed and signed-off dpia from the royal united hospitals bath , nhs foundation trust , is available as a template if required ( see electronic supplementary material appendix s1 ) . a `` frequently asked questions '' document is also available ( see electronic supplementary material appendix s2 ) . it is also now noted that the information commissioner has assured nhsx that she can not envisage a situation where she would take action against a health or care professional clearly trying to deliver care related to the covid-19 crisis . all data is anonymised from the point of upload through to its viewing . the full dataset will only be viewable by the bsti covid-19 imaging repository and database panel ( and other agreed parties with suitable clinical expertise ; the software has role-based access only ) . from the core imaging repository and database , teaching material will be published and refreshed on a regular basis . the imaging will only be stored for as long as the bsti executive committee deems it necessary . for bsti-appointed expert panel members , access to the full dataset is through a pre-registered login with a strong ( forced renewable ) password . access is audited , captured , and all usage is logged . the published teaching library and its content can be accessed without a login as a freely accessible teaching resource for radiologists . \n\n the bsti covid-19 registry : education \n\n the reported chest radiography and ct signs in covid-19 vary depending upon time of imaging from symptom onset and disease severity . patients with covid-19 may present to any hospital initially and radiologists have a duty to be aware of findings that are compatible with the diagnosis . there is a national shortage of radiologists , with the current shortfall estimated to be 1,104 . of existing radiologists , `` chest/lung '' is the fifth most popular subspecialty interest , but the provision of subspecialty thoracic radiology also varies dramatically across the uk . the bsti aim to produce a resource that helps to upskill all radiologists in the evolving clinical climate of covid-19 . in addition , webinars using content from the bsti covid-19 database are planned in conjunction with the royal college of radiologists . \n\n the bsti covid-19 database : research \n\n as of 8 march 2020 , there were 585 published articles on pubmed ( https : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed ) using the search phrase `` covid-19 '' . the world health organization has set covid-19 research as a priority . the largest imaging study in covid-19 ( in more than 1,000 patients from china ) raised the question of the role of ct in diagnosis , particularly in patients who are at high clinical risk , but had a negative initial real-time rt-pcr for the virus ; however , as the authors acknowledge , `` clinical and laboratory data were limited during this urgent period when regional hospitals were overloaded '' . consequently , it is uncertain if the ct findings are simply an epiphenomenon of the clinical or laboratory findings . through a united effort to submit cases to the bsti covid-19 imaging repository and database across the entire nhs , there is a real opportunity to add to the evidence base in the diagnosis and risk stratification of cases . the case upload with be accompanied by brief clinic metrics ( including patient age , sex , white cell count , c-reactive protein , p02 , indication for the imaging , rt-pcr status , prior imaging ) , which will help understand the temporal trends in imaging and the relevance of imaging findings in the context of known clinical and laboratory data . \n\n unfortunately , covid-19 is now a global pandemic , and the database has the potential to rapidly upscale to host nested registries for other countries and provide a global imaging perspective . all contributors will be considered collaborators on research outputs . \n\n summary \n\n for the bsti covid-19 imaging repository and database to realise its potential in education and research in the uk and across the globe , we call on all radiologists to engage and upload cases . every case of covid-19 counts . \n\n conflict of interest \n\n the authors declare no conflict of interest . \n\n references \n\n an update on covid-19 for the radiologist : a british society of thoracic imaging statement \n\n a statement from the british society of thoracic imaging statement : considerations in designing local imaging diagnostic algorithms \n\n mortality after a cholecystectomy : a population-based study \n\n vascular services quality improvement programme \n\n\n\n the royal college of radiologists \n\n world health authority . world experts and funders set priorities for covid-19 research \n\n correlation of chest ct and rt-pcr testing in coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in china : a report of 1014 cases \n\n supplementary data \n\n the following are the supplementary data to this article : \n\n supplementary data to this article can be found online at https : //doi.org/10.1016/j.crad.2020.03.005 . 
00000100	how do we decide to de-isolate covid-19 patients ? \n\n since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in december 2019 , the number of individuals affected by the disease has rapidly risen . it has been suggested that the disease is contagious during the incubation period in infected patients . however , the duration for which the disease remains contagious in the patients is not known . it is not known as to how and when can a decision be made to de-isolate these patients to avoid the transmission of the causative virus i.e . severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) . serial collections of oropharyngeal swab and sputum specimens are recommended by the taiwan centers for disease control and prevention ( taiwan cdc ) to detect sars-cov-2 from the upper airways in covid-19 patients . based on this , we hypothesized that virus detection from the upper airways may have a direct correlation with the possibility of transmission . in this study , we observed the clinical course and presence of sars-cov-2 rna in serial collections of specimens from the upper airways of two patients with covid-19 . \n\n clinical course of the wife and the husband with covid-19 and the threshold cycle ( ct ) values of rrt-pcr for sars-cov-2 in their oropharyngeal swab and saliva specimens . \n\n fig . 1 \n\n on january 28 , 2020 , a previously healthy non-smoking 44-year-old female , visited the out-patient clinic at the hospital . the patient complained of having a fever and headache since january 27 , 2020 ( fig . 1 ) . physical examinations revealed a body temperature of 39.3 c , and an oxygen saturation of 96 % in room air . the patient had not traveled abroad in the past three months and lived with her husband and their 18-year-old son . her 43-year-old husband , a smoker without any systemic disease , worked in the hanyang district of wuhan city , china and returned to taiwan on january 12 , 2020 . thereafter , he developed rhinorrhea on january 21 , 2020 , and later visited the clinic . he denied any history of being involved with the huanan seafood wholesale market in wuhan . his chest x-ray showed no abnormal findings . after he was prescribed antihistamines , his rhinorrhea quickly improved after three days . \n\n laboratory data of the wife revealed mild lymphopenia ( 642/mul ; reference range , 650-4300/mul ) and an elevated level of alanine aminotransferase ( 38 units/l ; reference range , 7-35 units/l ) . rapid antigen tests for influenza a , b , and adenovirus from throat swabs of the patient were all negative . under the suspicion of a covid-19 infection from her husband , she was admitted to the airborne isolation unit . we notified the taiwan cdc immediately . according to the guidelines of the taiwan cdc , an oropharyngeal swab and a sputum specimen must be examined for a suspected covid-19 patient . however , an oropharyngeal swab and saliva specimens were obtained because she had no respiratory symptoms . the taiwan cdc laboratory confirmed that the wife 's oropharyngeal swab was positive for sars-cov-2 rna using a real-time-reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( rrt-pcr ) assay . we immediately performed an oropharyngeal swab test for the husband . his oropharyngeal swab also showed a positive result . he was also admitted to the isolation unit . \n\n during the wife 's hospitalization , she was prescribed diclofenac as she complained about having a severe headache . she suffered from a general skin rash and face swelling after taking the medicine . we discontinued all prescriptions and administered three doses of intravenous 4 mg dexamethasone , 12 h apart , for her suspected hypersensitivity to non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs . her rash and face swelling subsided soon . on the fifth day of observation , her fever and headache improved . during admission , her chest x-ray did not show any abnormal infiltrates . \n\n serial collections of oropharyngeal swab and saliva specimens were performed according to the guidelines of taiwan cdc . the aforementioned tests returned positive and then negative results on day 17 and 19 , respectively , since the onset of the illness ( fig . 1 ) . subsequently , her swab and saliva specimens showed positive results again . on days 28 , 30 , and 32 , since the onset of the disease , the swab and saliva specimens showed negative results on all the three days . the patient 's stool sample tested negative on day 9 . we decided to discontinue her isolation after discussing with the experts of the taiwan cdc on day 33 . \n\n during the husband 's hospitalization , his oropharyngeal swab and saliva both tested positive on day 15 since the onset of the illness . on the 17th , 19th , 21st days , his oropharyngeal swab and saliva specimens tested negative . his stool sample showed a positive result on the 17th day of the illness , but then a negative result on the 19th day . isolation for him was discontinued on the 22nd day of the illness . \n\n according to the previous reports , the presentations were variable for the covid-19 patients . patients may be asymptomatic or may present with a mild cough , a fever , respiratory failure , acute respiratory distress syndrome , or potentially fatal outcomes . the contagious period of sars-cov-2 infection is not known . consequently , it is debatable as to when covid-19 patients can be de-isolated . we hypothesized that transmission via respiratory droplets is possible when the viruses are detectable in the patients ' upper airways . the taiwan cdc guidelines recommend serial collections of upper airway specimens for detecting the virus . \n\n our observations showed that the wife had more severe symptoms , such as a fever and headache , than the husband , and she received corticosteroid therapy for her hypersensitivity . she had much longer and intermittent virus detections from her upper airway in comparison to her husband . the wife may have had a higher viral load than the husband since she showed severe symptoms . it might also be more difficult for her to achieve virus clearance from the upper airway . moreover , since she was on corticosteroid therapy , the influence on viral clearance is not known . however , this factor may prolong virus shedding according to other coronavirus observations . individual immune responses for virus clearance may also influence the results . \n\n furthermore , live viruses are related to true transmission . we do not know whether the positive results of rrt-pcr refer to a persistent infection or to the presence of residual sequences of viral rna , as we did not perform virus cultures . the taiwan cdc guidelines have been upgraded to mention that the patients who show three continuous negative results of rrt-pcr from oropharyngeal swabs and sputum ( or saliva ) specimens from the upper airways can be de-isolated . in this case , we de-isolated the patients on february 28 , 2020 , based on the three consecutively negative results , \n\n three additional issues have been raised in this report . firstly , we collected saliva specimens in addition to oropharyngeal swabs of our patients for sars-cov-2 testing . previous studies have mentioned that the sars-cov2 was also detected in the saliva of covid-19 patients and serial saliva viral load monitoring generally showed a declining trend . saliva is considered a promising non-invasive specimen for diagnosis and monitoring . secondly , the rrt-pcr results in oropharyngeal swab and saliva samples turned to positive from negative were observed in the wife . this might be due to the variations in quality for sample collection and the viral loads , especially when prior series of samples with high cycle threshold values were noted . thirdly , our patient was prescribed with diclofenac , a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( nsaid ) for headache relief . diclofenac and ibuprofen are commonly used nsaids for pain-relieving agents . a previous study shows that ibuprofen could increase the binding affinity between sars-cov2 and its target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) , which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung , intestine , kidney , and blood vessels , and increased the risk of developing severe illness of covid-19 . acetaminophen seems to be a better choice than ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatory drugs . however , these preliminary observation and speculations need further investigation in the future . \n\n in conclusion , the wife had a more severe course of the disease and was under corticosteroid treatment . the virus was detected for a longer period in the upper airway of the wife as compared to her husband . however , we still do not know the actual contagious period of sars-cov-2 infection . currently , the rrt-pcr results of serial specimens from the upper airways are the only way to decide whether covid-19 patients can be de-isolated . further studies on individual immune responses against the virus infection are required . methods to distinguish a persistent infection from residual viral rna sequences are also required . furthermore , epidemiological data of the contagion may need to be collected and analyzed to understand the actual contagious period of sars-cov-2 infection . \n\n references \n\n a novel

01100000	the contribution of diabetic micro-angiopathy to adverse outcomes in covid-19 \n\n increasing evidence points to endothelial cell dysfunction as a key pathophysiological factor in severe coronavirus disease-19 ( covid-19 ) , manifested by platelet aggregation , microthrombi and altered vasomotor tone . this may be driven by direct endothelial cell entry by the virus , or indirectly by activated inflammatory cascade . major risk groups identified for adverse outcomes in covid-19 are diabetes , and those from the black , asian and ethnic minority ( bame ) populations . hyperglycaemia ( expressed as glycated haemoglobin or mean hospital glucose ) correlates with worse outcomes in covid-19 . it is not known whether hyperglycaemia is causative or is a surrogate marker - persistent hyperglycaemia is well known as an aetiological agent in microangiopathy . in this article , we propose that pre-existing endothelial dysfunction of microangiopathy , more commonly evident in diabetes and bame groups , makes an individual vulnerable to the subsequent 'endothelitis ' of covid-19 infection . \n\n there is emerging understanding that coronavirus disease-19 ( covid-19 ) induced respiratory complications appear to have a distinct pattern that differs from typical adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) . it is characterised by a dissociation between relatively well-preserved lung mechanics and the severity of hypoxemia . a possible explanation for the severe hypoxemia occurring in compliant lungs , is the loss of lung perfusion regulation and hypoxic vasoconstriction . coagulation dysfunction also appears to be common in severe covid-19 , with fatal cases exhibiting diffuse microvascular thrombosis , suggesting a thrombogenic microangiopathy . \n\n it is becoming increasingly recognised , therefore , that endothelial damage and pulmonary microvascular thrombosis are central to the clinical severity of covid-19 . endothelial access by the virus is mediated via the protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) , which is highly expressed on vascular tissue . replication of virus within the host cell can cause direct cellular damage and release of pro-inflammatory signals . angiotensin converting enzyme-2 ( ace-2 ) consumption by viral entry would be predicted to increase local angiotensin-ii concentration , contributing to vasoconstriction , endothelial activation , and pro-inflammatory cytokine release - inducing further alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial cell damage . endothelial cell involvement may then spread across vascular beds of different organs . \n\n both diabetes and ethnicity appear to be additional risk factors emerging in clinical sequelae of the covid-19 pandemic . within the hospitalised covid-19 population , individuals with diabetes are over-represented . a systematic review reported a significant association between diabetes and covid-19 infection severity ( odds ratio 2.67 , 95 % ci 1.91-3.74 ) . subsequent data from china estimated mortality rates near 10 % in diabetes , from a sample of 72,314 confirmed cases . the most recent publication , comprising 7,336 patients , showed the risk of fatal outcome from covid-19 was up to 50 % higher in patients with diabetes . furthermore , well-controlled blood glucose was associated with lower hospital mortality than poorly controlled glucose ( hazard ratio 0.14 ) . \n\n diabetes is characterised , not only by hyperglycaemia , but also endothelial dysfunction and microcirculatory impairment . microvascular disease ( either retinopathy or nephropathy ) is present in over one-third of newly-diagnosed patients with type-2 diabetes ( t2d ) . the consequences of endothelial dysfunction include dysregulation of vasodilation , fibrinolysis , and anti-aggregation - classically leading to macrovascular disease - and may contribute to microvascular disease retinopathy , nephropathy and neuropathy . however , evidence of microvascular dysfunction in one organ is a marker of systemic injury . it is increasingly recognised that there are microvascular pulmonary complications of diabetes ( 'diabetic lung ' ) . it has been suggested that reduced pulmonary diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide ( dlco ) may be attributed to vascular injury of pulmonary capillaries related to diabetic microangiopathy . importantly , the functional impairment was directly related to the degree of glucose control ( glycated haemoglobin - hba1c ) and the presence of diabetic microvascular complications including retinopathy , neuropathy , and microalbuminuria in a sex-specific manner . the relationship of impaired gas exchange with diabetes was observed , even in those who had never smoked . in these individuals , the pulmonary microvasculature may be poorly prepared to meet the challenge of covid-19 infection . \n\n the black , asian and minority ethnic ( bame ) community have suffered disproportionally from covid-19 . bame , although only 13 % of the united kingdom population and a younger age distribution , accounts for one third of all covid-19 cases and 34 % of critically-ill covid-19 patients . the mechanisms underlying the disproportionate effect of covid-19 infection on bame patients remain incompletely understood . however , bame groups have a disproportionally high prevalence of t2d and disparities have been observed in diabetes control , monitoring and presence of microvascular complications in the bame , compared to white population . in this context , dysglycaemia ( both hba1c and mean glucose ) associating with adverse outcomes in covid-19 , may be surrogates for the presence and severity of underlying microvascular disease . the prevalence of prediabetes among adults is approximately 38 % and 35 % , in the united states and united kingdom respectively . prediabetes is also over-represented in bame population . in the uk , the hazard ratio for prediabetes in south asians was 1.67 ( 1.12 to 2.50 ) and for blacks 1.45 ( 0.92 to 2.27 ) , compared to the white population . although it is alluring to think that people with prediabetes are protected from microvascular disease ; early stages of retinopathy , nephropathy , and neuropathy have been reported in people with prediabetes , with a prevalence of up to 10 % . \n\n microvascular disease and endothelial dysfunction may underlie adverse outcomes in covid-19 and may represent the pathophysiological key missing link that identifies susceptible populations and may require specific treatment . analyses of data on patients with covid-19 should include details of diabetes complications and age , to untangle the complex interaction between ethnicity , diabetes and covid-19 outcomes . \n\n conflict of interest \n\n the authors declare no conflict of interest . \n\n funding \n\n the authors received no funding from an external source . \n\n references \n\n covid-19 does not lead

11000000	clinical characteristics of 145 patients with corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in taizhou , zhejiang , china . \n\n objective : the aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of corona virus disease 2019 in taizhou , china . methods : a single center retrospective observational study was performed between jan 1 , 2020 and mar 11 , 2020 at taizhou public health medical center , zhejiang , china . all patients with confirmed corona virus disease 2019 were enrolled , and their clinical data were gathered by reviewing electronic medical records . outcomes of severely ill patients and non-severely ill patients were compared . results : of 145 hospitalized patients with covid-19 , the average age was 47.5 years old ( standard deviation , 14.6 ) and 54.5 % were men . hypertension was the most common comorbidity ( 15.2 % ) , followed by diabetes mellitus ( 9.7 % ) . common symptoms included dry cough ( 81.4 % ) , fever ( 75.2 % ) , anorexia ( 42.8 % ) , fatigue ( 40.7 % ) , chest tightness ( 32.4 % ) , diarrhea ( 26.9 % ) and dizziness ( 20 % ) . according to imaging examination , 79.3 % patients showed bilateral pneumonia , 18.6 % showed unilateral pneumonia , 61.4 % showed ground-glass opacity , and 2.1 % showed no abnormal result . compared with non-severely ill patients , severely ill patients were older ( mean , years , 52.8 vs. 45.3 , p < 0.01 ) , had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus ( 16.3 % vs. 6.9 % , p = 0.08 ) , had a higher body mass index ( mean , 24.78 vs. 23.20 , p = 0.02 ) and were more likely to have fever ( 90.7 % vs. 68.6 % , p = 0.01 ) , anorexia ( 60.5 % vs. 35.3 % , p = 0.01 ) , chest tightness ( 60.5 % vs.20.6 % , p < 0.01 ) and dyspnea ( 7.0 % vs. 0 % , p = 0.03 ) . of the 43 severely ill patients , 6 ( 14 % ) received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy , and 1 ( 2.3 % ) received invasive mechanical ventilation . conclusions : older patients or patients with comorbidities such as obesity or diabetes mellitus were more likely to have severe condition . treatments of covid-19 is still experimental and more clinical trials are needed . 
00001000	the possible impact of covid-19 on colorectal surgery in italy . \n\n the covid-19 outbreak in italy is stopping access to elective benign disease treatment and changing the approach to malignant disease as well as the outpatients care of those patients treated for colorectal cancer . the lack of knowledge about the possible implications of the spread of the infection during surgery could extend to infect surgeons , surgery nurses and also the anesthesiologists , the results will become evident in the long term . the surgical approach may change going towards less invasive procedures to minimize the aerosolized biological fluids , this approach could reduce the access to first level hospitals changing the entire health care system in the future . 
00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region , presented to the emergency with a 3-day history of headaches , dizziness , intermittent nausea , and vomiting . brain mr showed a tumor that was entirely confined within the third ventricle , causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the child has an uncomplicated recovery after surgery , and covid-19 was eventually ruled out after a 14-day quarantine . \n\n finally , we have some additional tips for conducting surgery under level 3 precautions . a comfortable goggle and use of antifogging agent are very helpful . in addition , surgeons should avoid unnecessary conversation and perform the surgery as gently as possible to prevent splashing blood in a negative pressure operating room . \n\n neuro-oncology patients may become infected with covid-19 , and thus surgery for these patients can not be avoided . as neurosurgeons , it is crucial that we do our utmost to care for our patients while ensuring our own safety at the same time . in these challenging times , we have faith that through our concerted efforts , this pandemic

00001000	'let us help'- why senior medical students are the next step in battling the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n as senior medical students in the uk , we read dr stein 's letter on the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) 2 and began wondering where we fit in , in this pandemic . as the government heads into a 'war footing ' 13 , there is an increased need for medical staff . there is speculation of bringing back retired doctors , many of who fall into at risk categories . with clinical placement and exams cancelled , we are determined to use our hard-earned skills in some way , to help in what is the biggest global emergency of our lifetime . 
00001000	role of mask/respirator protection against sars-cov-2 \n\n to the editor \n\n since its outbreak on december 31 , 2019 , in wuhan , a central city in china , coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) has now spread to almost all countries in the world . it has been declared a pandemic , and it has infected over 1,041,126 people in a very short time , with 55,132 deaths as ofapril 3 , 2020 . wearing masks/respirators and practicingself-isolation at home have been recommended as guidelines for thepublic . however , the problem is the number of cases among medical personnel . interestingly , a higher risk of infection was noticed in male professionals . there are currently many types of masks/respirators available , ranging from simple surgical masks designed to protect wearers from microorganism transmission and fit loosely to the user 's face , through n95 masks used to prevent users from inhaling small airborne particles . these must fit tightly to the user 's face . masks differ primarily in their maximum internal leakage rate limit . surgical masks are designed to protect against droplets or particles with a diameter of > 100 mum , whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) virus is essentially spherical , albeit slightly pleomorphic , with a diameter of 60-140 nm and 100 times smaller than the pore diameter . thus , surgical masks can not prevent inhalation of small airborne particles ; however , both can protect users from large droplets and sprays . the pn-en 149:2001 standard defines 3 protection classes for half masks : filtering face piece 1 ( ffp1 ) , filtering face piece 2 ( ffp2 ) , and filtering face piece 3 ( ffp3 ) . the maximum internal leakage limit is 25 % for ffp1 , 11 % for ffp2 , and 5 % for ffp3 . class ffp1 masks retain about 80 % of particles smaller than 2 mum , ffp2 ones retain 94 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum , and ffp3 ones retain 99.95 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum ( table ) . \n\n test ffp1 ffp2 ffp3 concentration of harmful substances till 4 x nds till 10 x nds till 30 x nds leakage < 22 % < 8 % < 2 % penetration < 20 % < 6 % < 1 % initial expiration resistance at 95 l/min < 210 pa < 240 pa < 300 pa \n\n filtration efficiency for each class of masks \n\n abbreviations : ffp1 , filtering face piece 1 ; ffp2 , filtering face piece 2 ; ffp3 , filtering face piece 3 ; nds , the highest acceptable concentration of the harmful factor . \n\n at the moment , we may meet divergent recommendations for the use of masks . while the centers for disease control and prevention recommend the use of masks in low-risk and high-risk situations , the world health organization advises applying masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations . long et al conclude in their meta-analysis that the use of n95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza . they suggest that n95 respirators should not be recommended for the general public and non-high-risk medical staff who are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients . \n\n the potential of face masks to reduce the spread of respiratory infections could be useful . wang et al indicated that 10 of 213 medical professionals with no mask were infected by covid-19 as compared with 0 of 278 wearing n95 respirators . \n\n it is also worth noting that the respirator increases resistance to inhalation . the longer they are used , the more difficult breathing becomes because of more absorbed dust . what is more , the effectiveness decreases with the increase of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the respirator and face ( the so-called dead space ) . the concentration of carbon dioxide in the dead space increases with each subsequent exhalation . therefore , masks should be replaced frequently . additionally , to improve the comfort of use , masks use 1-way exhalation valves , which accelerate the circulation of gases.6 \n\n to conclude , the use of protective masks can and should be the first protection against sars-cov-2 transmission to medical personnel . medical personnel should use class ffp3 masks . additionally , the application of visors to cover the entire face during contact with the patient is worth considering . \n\n references \n\n association between 2019-ncov transmission and n95 respirator use . \n\n comparison of performance of three different types of respiratory protection devices . \n\n protecting healthcare staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome : filtration capacity of multiple surgical masks . \n\n a close shave ? performance of p2/n95 respirators in health care workers with facial hair : results of the beards ( adequate respiratory defences ) study . \n\n effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza : a systematic review and meta-analysis . \n\n cloth masks versus medical masks for covid-19 .

that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region , presented to the emergency with a 3-day history of headaches , dizziness , intermittent nausea , and vomiting . brain mr showed a tumor that was entirely confined within the third ventricle , causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the child has an uncomplicated recovery after surgery , and covid-19 was eventually ruled out after a 14-day quarantine . \n\n finally , we have some additional tips for conducting surgery under level 3 precautions . a comfortable goggle and use of antifogging agent are very helpful . in addition , surgeons should avoid unnecessary conversation and perform the surgery as gently as possible to prevent splashing blood in a negative pressure operating room . \n\n neuro-oncology patients may become infected with covid-19 , and thus surgery for these patients can not be avoided . as neurosurgeons , it is crucial that we do our utmost to care for our patients while ensuring our own safety at the same time . in these challenging times , we have faith that through our concerted efforts , this pandemic

00001000	'let us help'- why senior medical students are the next step in battling the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n as senior medical students in the uk , we read dr stein 's letter on the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) 2 and began wondering where we fit in , in this pandemic . as the government heads into a 'war footing ' 13 , there is an increased need for medical staff . there is speculation of bringing back retired doctors , many of who fall into at risk categories . with clinical placement and exams cancelled , we are determined to use our hard-earned skills in some way , to help in what is the biggest global emergency of our lifetime . 
00001000	role of mask/respirator protection against sars-cov-2 \n\n to the editor \n\n since its outbreak on december 31 , 2019 , in wuhan , a central city in china , coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) has now spread to almost all countries in the world . it has been declared a pandemic , and it has infected over 1,041,126 people in a very short time , with 55,132 deaths as ofapril 3 , 2020 . wearing masks/respirators and practicingself-isolation at home have been recommended as guidelines for thepublic . however , the problem is the number of cases among medical personnel . interestingly , a higher risk of infection was noticed in male professionals . there are currently many types of masks/respirators available , ranging from simple surgical masks designed to protect wearers from microorganism transmission and fit loosely to the user 's face , through n95 masks used to prevent users from inhaling small airborne particles . these must fit tightly to the user 's face . masks differ primarily in their maximum internal leakage rate limit . surgical masks are designed to protect against droplets or particles with a diameter of > 100 mum , whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) virus is essentially spherical , albeit slightly pleomorphic , with a diameter of 60-140 nm and 100 times smaller than the pore diameter . thus , surgical masks can not prevent inhalation of small airborne particles ; however , both can protect users from large droplets and sprays . the pn-en 149:2001 standard defines 3 protection classes for half masks : filtering face piece 1 ( ffp1 ) , filtering face piece 2 ( ffp2 ) , and filtering face piece 3 ( ffp3 ) . the maximum internal leakage limit is 25 % for ffp1 , 11 % for ffp2 , and 5 % for ffp3 . class ffp1 masks retain about 80 % of particles smaller than 2 mum , ffp2 ones retain 94 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum , and ffp3 ones retain 99.95 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum ( table ) . \n\n test ffp1 ffp2 ffp3 concentration of harmful substances till 4 x nds till 10 x nds till 30 x nds leakage < 22 % < 8 % < 2 % penetration < 20 % < 6 % < 1 % initial expiration resistance at 95 l/min < 210 pa < 240 pa < 300 pa \n\n filtration efficiency for each class of masks \n\n abbreviations : ffp1 , filtering face piece 1 ; ffp2 , filtering face piece 2 ; ffp3 , filtering face piece 3 ; nds , the highest acceptable concentration of the harmful factor . \n\n at the moment , we may meet divergent recommendations for the use of masks . while the centers for disease control and prevention recommend the use of masks in low-risk and high-risk situations , the world health organization advises applying masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations . long et al conclude in their meta-analysis that the use of n95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza . they suggest that n95 respirators should not be recommended for the general public and non-high-risk medical staff who are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients . \n\n the potential of face masks to reduce the spread of respiratory infections could be useful . wang et al indicated that 10 of 213 medical professionals with no mask were infected by covid-19 as compared with 0 of 278 wearing n95 respirators . \n\n it is also worth noting that the respirator increases resistance to inhalation . the longer they are used , the more difficult breathing becomes because of more absorbed dust . what is more , the effectiveness decreases with the increase of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the respirator and face ( the so-called dead space ) . the concentration of carbon dioxide in the dead space increases with each subsequent exhalation . therefore , masks should be replaced frequently . additionally , to improve the comfort of use , masks use 1-way exhalation valves , which accelerate the circulation of gases.6 \n\n to conclude , the use of protective masks can and should be the first protection against sars-cov-2 transmission to medical personnel . medical personnel should use class ffp3 masks . additionally , the application of visors to cover the entire face during contact with the patient is worth considering . \n\n references \n\n association between 2019-ncov transmission and n95 respirator use . \n\n comparison of performance of three different types of respiratory protection devices . \n\n protecting healthcare staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome : filtration capacity of multiple surgical masks . \n\n a close shave ? performance of p2/n95 respirators in health care workers with facial hair : results of the beards ( adequate respiratory defences ) study . \n\n effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza : a systematic review and meta-analysis . \n\n cloth masks versus medical masks for covid-19 .

00001000	'let us help'- why senior medical students are the next step in battling the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n as senior medical students in the uk , we read dr stein 's letter on the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) 2 and began wondering where we fit in , in this pandemic . as the government heads into a 'war footing ' 13 , there is an increased need for medical staff . there is speculation of bringing back retired doctors , many of who fall into at risk categories . with clinical placement and exams cancelled , we are determined to use our hard-earned skills in some way , to help in what is the biggest global emergency of our lifetime . 
00001000	role of mask/respirator protection against sars-cov-2 \n\n to the editor \n\n since its outbreak on december 31 , 2019 , in wuhan , a central city in china , coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) has now spread to almost all countries in the world . it has been declared a pandemic , and it has infected over 1,041,126 people in a very short time , with 55,132 deaths as ofapril 3 , 2020 . wearing masks/respirators and practicingself-isolation at home have been recommended as guidelines for thepublic . however , the problem is the number of cases among medical personnel . interestingly , a higher risk of infection was noticed in male professionals . there are currently many types of masks/respirators available , ranging from simple surgical masks designed to protect wearers from microorganism transmission and fit loosely to the user 's face , through n95 masks used to prevent users from inhaling small airborne particles . these must fit tightly to the user 's face . masks differ primarily in their maximum internal leakage rate limit . surgical masks are designed to protect against droplets or particles with a diameter of > 100 mum , whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) virus is essentially spherical , albeit slightly pleomorphic , with a diameter of 60-140 nm and 100 times smaller than the pore diameter . thus , surgical masks can not prevent inhalation of small airborne particles ; however , both can protect users from large droplets and sprays . the pn-en 149:2001 standard defines 3 protection classes for half masks : filtering face piece 1 ( ffp1 ) , filtering face piece 2 ( ffp2 ) , and filtering face piece 3 ( ffp3 ) . the maximum internal leakage limit is 25 % for ffp1 , 11 % for ffp2 , and 5 % for ffp3 . class ffp1 masks retain about 80 % of particles smaller than 2 mum , ffp2 ones retain 94 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum , and ffp3 ones retain 99.95 % of particles smaller than 0.5 mum ( table ) . \n\n test ffp1 ffp2 ffp3 concentration of harmful substances till 4 x nds till 10 x nds till 30 x nds leakage < 22 % < 8 % < 2 % penetration < 20 % < 6 % < 1 % initial expiration resistance at 95 l/min < 210 pa < 240 pa < 300 pa \n\n filtration efficiency for each class of masks \n\n abbreviations : ffp1 , filtering face piece 1 ; ffp2 , filtering face piece 2 ; ffp3 , filtering face piece 3 ; nds , the highest acceptable concentration of the harmful factor . \n\n at the moment , we may meet divergent recommendations for the use of masks . while the centers for disease control and prevention recommend the use of masks in low-risk and high-risk situations , the world health organization advises applying masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations . long et al conclude in their meta-analysis that the use of n95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza . they suggest that n95 respirators should not be recommended for the general public and non-high-risk medical staff who are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients . \n\n the potential of face masks to reduce the spread of respiratory infections could be useful . wang et al indicated that 10 of 213 medical professionals with no mask were infected by covid-19 as compared with 0 of 278 wearing n95 respirators . \n\n it is also worth noting that the respirator increases resistance to inhalation . the longer they are used , the more difficult breathing becomes because of more absorbed dust . what is more , the effectiveness decreases with the increase of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the respirator and face ( the so-called dead space ) . the concentration of carbon dioxide in the dead space increases with each subsequent exhalation . therefore , masks should be replaced frequently . additionally , to improve the comfort of use , masks use 1-way exhalation valves , which accelerate the circulation of gases.6 \n\n to conclude , the use of protective masks can and should be the first protection against sars-cov-2 transmission to medical personnel . medical personnel should use class ffp3 masks . additionally , the application of visors to cover the entire face during contact with the patient is worth considering . \n\n references \n\n association between 2019-ncov transmission and n95 respirator use . \n\n comparison of performance of three different types of respiratory protection devices . \n\n protecting healthcare staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome : filtration capacity of multiple surgical masks . \n\n a close shave ? performance of p2/n95 respirators in health care workers with facial hair : results of the beards ( adequate respiratory defences ) study . \n\n effectiveness of n95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza : a systematic review and meta-analysis . \n\n cloth masks versus medical masks for covid-19 . 
00001000	emergency trauma care during the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in china \n\n background \n\n a novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in wuhan , hubei province , in december 2019 ; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans . china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease . however , a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking . to regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak , we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in wuhan . \n\n main body \n\n the article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 , indications for emergency surgery , and infection prevention and control for medical personnel , providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period . \n\n conclusions \n\n the measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of covid-19 . \n\n background \n\n a novel corona virus disease ( covid-19 ) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) began in wuhan , hubei province , china , in december 2019 . by february 13 , 2020 , more than 60,000 cases were confirmed , nearly 50,000 in hubei alone , and the source of the infection was yet to be definitely determined . the world health organization ( who ) has declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern ( pheic ) . considering the current rate of human to human transmission , most countries in the world should be well prepared for the potential global covid-19 pandemic . china is on the frontline in the fight against the virus , and medical staff have become exhausted due to the excessive workload brought on by the outbreak . medical testing tools and personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , such as face shields , goggles , and gloves , have become scarce and have had to be rationed among teams and medical centers , with severe shortage in hubei , the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak . a report from a neurosurgery department of a teaching hospital in wuhan showed that from december 25 , 2019 , to february 6 , 2020 , eight covid-19 suspected patients were admitted , and three were confirmed . consequently , 12 medical personnel were infected ( 11 nurses and one doctor ) , among whom three had been in close contact with the first confirmed case . according to the data released by the national health commission ( nhc ) of the people 's republic of china , a total of 1716 medical personnel infections had been reported nationwide , accounting for 3.8 % of the total confirmed cases by 24:00 on february 11 , 2020 , of which six ( 0.4 % ) had died . of these , hubei province reported 1502 cases , accounting for 87.5 % of the total medical personnel infections , while wuhan city reported 1102 cases , accounting for 73.4 % . notably , medical personnel are the most valuable resource during the outbreak . how to protect them from infection is one of the foremost challenges in the fight against sars-cov-2 . \n\n although china has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of sars-cov-2 , severe trauma can still occur . during the outbreak , the population of trauma patients may be diverse in terms of infection status , including patients who were previously healthy , suspected to be infected , confirmed infected , close contacts of infected individuals , and asymptomatic carriers . thus , balancing optimal trauma care while preventing further spread of the viral infection during the outbreak is a major challenge . \n\n to our knowledge , there is no relevant consensus or clinical guideline available on the indications of , timing of or perioperative protection during emergency surgery for trauma . to protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of trauma care , we have summarized the recommended perioperative infection prevention and control measures for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 based on current practical experience in china and the published literature on surgical practice during the past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) , ebola virus , and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( mers-cov ) . \n\n main text \n\n general principles \n\n special requirements for the hospitals receiving trauma patients during the outbreak \n\n emergency department : set up a triage area for assessment of all patients at admission , allowing early recognition of possible sars-cov-2 infection and immediate isolation of patients with suspected sars-cov-2 infection in an area separate from other patients . \n\n radiology department : a dedicated ct room should be kept on standby for the examination of infected patients . \n\n operating room ( or ) : a relatively isolated negative-pressure or is preferable ; if there is no permanent negative-pressure or , a temporarily modified negative-pressure or the main operating suite of the hospital can be converted . \n\n intensive care unit ( icu ) : an isolated area should be prepared in the icu , and suspected patients should be treated in a single space . \n\n intrahospital transport : although an ideal trauma center with a door-to-door ct room and negative-pressure or are preferable in this situation , most regions in china do not operate such facilities . therefore , a predetermined transport route should be used to minimize exposure , and any intrahospital transport should utilize dedicated carts demarcated by a warning logo equipped with protective supplies and hand disinfectants . the patient should wear a medical mask , and the walls and the floor of the passageways and the elevator should be covered with a plastic lining . \n\n to control the spread of covid-19 , basic principles for treating infectious diseases should be followed , and necessary measures should be taken before receiving trauma patients . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n precaution level applicable personnel and scenarios personal protective equipment level 1 triage , emergency department clean non-sterile long gown , disposable head cover , disposable medical mask , and gloves . level 2 close contact with suspected patients , or handling secretions , feces , and personal items belonging to patients ; performing ct scan ( fig . 1 ) disposable head cover , gloves , disposable coverall , n95 respirator or equivalent , goggle or face shield , rubber boots or fluid-resistant overshoes , etc . level 3 close contact with suspected patients , or collecting blood , respiratory tract samples of patients , especially for endotracheal intubation , airway care , and sputum suction , as well as emergency surgery ( fig . 2 ) . on the basis of wearing secondary protective equipment such as goggle or face shield , other protective equipment should be strengthened . for instance , adding disposable surgical clothing and gloves in addition to disposable coverall and gloves . two layers of gloves covering protective clothing and surgical clothes sleeves , respectively , use of a powered air purifying respirator ( papr ) . \n\n three-level precaution protocol \n\n to standardize and simplify the precaution measures and equipment required for different personnel and scenarios in trauma care , we adopted a three-level precaution protocol in trauma care ( table 1 ) . \n\n all levels of precaution were based on implementing standard precautions , including hand hygiene , respiratory hygiene , and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment ( ppe ) according to different risk levels . proper training of the standard donning and doffing procedures is the basis of effective protection . in epidemic areas such as hubei province , all patients can be regarded as potentially suspected patients during the outbreak , and the level of the precaution should be elevated . \n\n triage \n\n classification of the patients suspected cases clinical confirmed cases ( hubei only ) pathogenic confirmed cases diagnostic basis outside hubei province : two of the clinical manifestations with at least one of the epidemiological histories , three of the clinical manifestations without epidemiological history suspected patient in hubei province with ct findings of pneumonia suspected or clinically confirmed patients with at least one pathogenic evidence epidemiological investigation 1 . travel to or residence in wuhan in the 14 days prior to symptom onset ; 2 . close contactb with sars-cov-2 infection ( rrt-pcr positive ) within 14 days before onset ; 3 . exposed to patients from wuhan and surrounding areas , or from a community with patients who reported fever or respiratory symptoms14 d before onset ; 4 . clustering outbreak . - - clinical manifestations and ct scan 1 . fever and/or respiratory symptoms ; 2 . imaging characteristics of covid-19 ( ct : multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes in early stage , which are obvious in the peripheral lung , and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs , and lung consolidation may occur in severe cases ) ; 3 . the total number of white blood cells in the early stage is normal or decreased , and the lymphocyte count is decreased - - pathogenic evidence null null 1 . detection of sars-cov-2 in respiratory specimens and sera by rrt-pcr assays ; 2 . by virus dna sequencing , respiratory or blood samples dna sequence highly homologous with sars-cov-2 . \n\n diagnostic criteria of covid-19a \n\n covid-19 coronavirus induced disease , sars-cov-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 , rrt-pcr real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction \n\n athe diagnostic criteria were defined according to guidance for the diagnosis and management for covid-19 ( 5th edition ) released by national health commission of people 's republic of china in feb. 4 , 2020 \n\n bclose contact is defined as follows : \n\n - healthcare-associated exposure , including providing direct care for covid-19 patients , working with healthcare workers infected with novel coronavirus , visiting patients , or staying in the same close environment as a covid-19 patient \n\n - working together in close proximity or sharing the same classroom environment with a covid-19 patient \n\n - traveling together with a covid-19 patient in any kind of conveyance \n\n - living in the same household as a covid-19 patient \n\n trauma patients during the outbreak should be managed using the relevant contents in table 2 , and they should complete a brief epidemiological investigation at the triage stage . however , the trauma patients ' history may be unreliable , as they may not have time to be detailed . more emphasis should be placed on the objective data . during the outbreak in wuhan , a total of 32 emergency operations were performed in a tertiary care hospital , including 19 suspected and seven pathogenic confirmed cases . in addition , nine covid-19 patients in another tertiary care hospital underwent gastrointestinal surgery , but in all of these patients , covid-19 was diagnosed postoperatively . it is worth noting that there have been many cases of asymptomatic patients with an incubation period . the maximum incubation period was reported to be 24 days . \n\n evaluation \n\n trauma care is highly time dependent and requires rapid and effective evaluation and management . during the outbreak , primary and secondary surveys should be completed while maintaining the premise of effective protection . \n\n general principles of evaluation \n\n dynamic evaluation strategies should be conducted throughout the trauma care process . the personal protective equipment ( ppe ) worn by medical personnel may result in limited or incomplete physical examinations ( such as palpation and auscultation ) . therefore , injury assessment may rely on radiological examinations . \n\n radiology evaluation \n\n a chest ct scan is recommended for all severe trauma patients if there is no contraindication . if the chest ct scan is not possible due to critical condition , the patient should be treated as a suspect for infection until infection is excluded . \n\n level 3 ppe during ct examination \n\n if the hospital has a trauma resuscitation unit , complete x-ray including but not limited to the chest and focused assessment with sonography for trauma ( fast ) in the trauma resuscitation unit should be performed . for hemodynamic stabilization , a ct scan including but not limited to the chest should be performed ( fig . 1 ) . if the hospital does not have a trauma resuscitation unit , patients with hemodynamic instability should be resuscitated in the emergency department and undergo fast simultaneously . once the hemodynamic status is stable enough , the ct scan should be performed as soon as possible . \n\n ct scan protocol for trauma patients suspected of having covid-19 : medical personnel should first determine the method and scope of the scan , including but not limited to the chest , according to the mechanism of injury . for stab wounds , the segment and body cavity near the wound should be examined . for gunshot wounds , due to the high kinetic energy of the projectiles , the tortuous wound path , and the heavy tissue damage , the scanning range should be expanded appropriately . patients who have sustained blunt injuries with high energy , such as traffic injuries , should usually be scanned with enhanced scanning ranging from head to mid-thigh ( including the whole lower limb when there is lower limb injury ) . enhanced scanning is helpful in providing further information on organ injury , and three-dimensional reconstruction of blood vessels and bone should be performed when major vascular and bone injury is suspected . \n\n ct features of covid-19 : it should be noted that the pulmonary imaging changes of covid-19 vary depending on the patient 's age , immunity status , stage of disease at the time of the scan , underlying disease , and drug intervention . reports have shown that in the early stage of infection , ct shows multiple small plaque shadows and interstitial changes , which are obvious in the peripheral lung and then develop into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltration shadows in both lungs . in severe cases , lung consolidation could occur . in addition , special attention should be paid to discerning between covid-19 infection and pulmonary contusion . \n\n blood and pathogen specimen collection \n\n if possible , nasopharyngeal swabs , sputum , lower respiratory tract secretions , and blood samples should be collected and sent for rrt-pcr in the emergency period . if no respiratory tract specimens are collected before the operation due to time constraints , they can be collected during or after the operation . \n\n all specimens shall be deemed to be potentially infectious . collection , transportation , and processing of any clinical specimens should be performed by biological safety training qualified medical staff . level 3 precautions should be adopted to minimize the possibility of exposure . \n\n the results of rrt-pcr may be falsely negative due to the influence of sampling , transportation , extraction , and testing . recent observations have shown that 30 to 40 % of patients with covid-19 ct features were rrt-pcr negative . as a result , the protection standard can not be lowered due to negative results . since the rrt-pcr test can take several hours to confirm the diagnosis , chest ct is recommended as the basis for the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 in suspected patients , especially in areas with a high incidence of the disease . the use of chest ct not only helps to control the spread of the epidemic but can also ensure definitive care for trauma injuries in a timely manner . \n\n emergency surgery \n\n emergency surgery is of great importance for severe trauma patients , the aim of which includes hemorrhage control , contamination abatement , and compartment pressure relief as soon as possible . effective prevention of sars-cov-2 transmission by standard intraoperative protective measures is an important indicator of a successful operation . from the available evidence , sars-cov-2 is spread mainly through respiratory droplets and contact , while aerosol and fecal-oral transmission are still under investigation . from the existing evidence and our practical experience , all medical staff should adopt level 3 precautions when entering the or . \n\n or preparation \n\n an independent negative pressure operation room is the first choice . operations can only be performed when the pressure is between - 10 and - 5 pa . if a negative pressure or is not available , a relatively isolated or with an independent purification system is an alternative option . nevertheless , the purification system should be shut down during the operation , and a final disinfection should be performed postoperatively . as in standard trauma protocols , the more critical patient should be operated on first . if two or more suspected or confirmed infected patients arrive in the or , a 30-min disinfection is warranted before the subsequent operation . the dedicated or should be clearly marked as covid-19 exclusive . \n\n the dedicated covid-19 or should be designed with a special passage and elevator . the design should focus on shortening the outdoor distance , reducing the chance of human contact , and limiting the time spent in suspected contaminated areas . materials and equipment should only be delivered by specially assigned staff . people inside the or are not allowed to leave during the operation , and outdoor personnel should not enter without permission . surgical articles should be clearly identified , and the use of disposable items is recommended . to maintain pressure , surgical supplies ( surgical instruments , dressings , single-use consumables , high-value consumables , medications , and relevant items ) should be well prepared in advance . only unidirectional flow is permitted ( nothing should be taken out once it is entered during the operation ) . personnel movement and the frequency of door opening are strictly limited . nondisposable items should be disposed of postoperatively in strict accordance with regulations . two suction apparatuses are optimal , one of which is for exclusive use by the anesthesiologist . the negative pressure aspirator should be immediately placed on the patient 's face to minimize the spread of respiratory secretions after entering the operation room . \n\n ppe for operation personnel \n\n protective clothing for surgical personnel : a after wearing protective clothing and inner gloves , b after wearing operating clothes and outer gloves \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe donning \n\n the topic of intraoperative protection remains controversial because most surgeons have no experience performing surgery while wearing heavy and airproof contagion gowns and goggles . according to practice in china , some medical personnel wore two surgical gowns , two contagion gowns and four pairs of gloves for surgery during the covid-19 epidemic . instead of enhancing protective effects , such excessive protection can reduce the visual , auditory , and tactile sensitivity of the surgeon , thus reducing the precision of surgical operations ( fig . 2 ) . the influence of excessive protection on the surgeon mainly includes ( 1 ) difficulty breathing , ( 2 ) fog on goggles and face shields that interfere with vision , ( 3 ) constriction of visual fields , ( 4 ) loss of flexibility due to multiple layers of gloves , and ( 5 ) double or triple the duration of the operation . a practical lesson had been learned from the case of a 7-year-old girl with suspected covid-19 infection who was subjected to an urgent craniotomy due to obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a third ventricle germ cell-derived tumor . the surgical team adopted a level 3 precaution including n95 respirators or papr , and full coverage with protective gowns ( shoe covers included ) and sterile surgical gowns . consequently , an operation that would have taken 2-3 h ended up taking 10 h. possible solutions for reducing the impact of ppe on surgery include reducing the or temperature ( minimizing the formation of moisture on goggles ) and enhancing the lighting in the room to obtain better vision . all ppes are fit for single use except papr . the steps of donning and doffing should be completed under professional supervision ( fig . 3 ) . \n\n anesthesia \n\n regional nerve block is the first choice for limb surgeries . general anesthesia is recommended for neurosurgery , torso trauma , or multiple trauma with shock . \n\n attention should be paid to avoid aerosol generation caused by coughing and other causes in airway operations . intubation should be performed after rapid induction and full muscle relaxation to ensure complete disappearance of spontaneous breathing , and sputum aspiration before intubation should be avoided . remote endotracheal intubation by disposable glide scope with an assistant is recommended . awake endotracheal intubation is not recommended for patients with a difficult airway , hypoxia , or unconsciousness . if face mask or laryngeal mask ventilation is able to maintain oxygenation , multiple tools ( fiberoptic bronchoscope , glide scope , light stick , laryngeal mask ) can be used to assist endotracheal intubation after rapid induction of general anesthesia . if not , cricothyroid laryngotomy should be performed without any hesitation . rapid induction via oral intubation is recommended in cases of a possibly full stomach . mask positive pressure ventilation after administration should be avoided . no emetic measure is recommended . extra caution should be taken on when a nasogastric tube is in place . covid-19 can cause pulmonary inflammation that can induce added lung injury , restricted crystal fluid , and protective ventilation . the proper mechanical ventilation parameters include limited tidal volume ( < 8 ml/kg ) and airway pressure ( platform pressure < 30 cm h2o ) ; 5-10 cm h2o positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation ( peep ) is optional for alveoli expansion and oxygenation maintenance . permissive hypercapnia is also acceptable . \n\n surgical strategy \n\n the concept of damage control surgery should be followed to simplify the operation . it is optimal to finish an operation within 90 min , and strategies such as packing hemostasis , external fixation , and temporary abdominal closure are helpful to shorten the operation time . surgical personnel should be highly focused and closely coordinated . gentle movement is essential to avoid accidental injury and contamination caused by the spattering of blood , fluid , and bone debris . limiting rinsing and drainage of bodily fluids is another key to effectively reducing intraoperative contamination . reliable hemostasis should be maintained to prevent bleeding around the incision . excessive negative pressure suction and violent operations are prohibited . it is also suggested that electrotome use is not suitable under this scenario ; if it must be used , the power should be minimized . smoke should be quickly suctioned to avoid aerosol generation . \n\n postoperative management \n\n postoperative management of patients \n\n after the operation , the patient should be transferred to an isolation ward in the icu . the endotracheal tubes should be removed under analgesia to avoid violent coughing while the patient is stable . sputum aspiration should be performed by a closed suction system . trauma and surgery can impair the patient 's immune function . clinically , some asymptomatic covid-19 patients suffered rapid deterioration after surgery . surgeons and anesthesiologists should be aware that acute lung injury caused by covid-19 may exist preoperatively or worsen postoperatively . therefore , special attention should be paid to the monitoring of body temperature , infection , and hemodynamic index . reexamination of chest ct and rrt-pcr tests is also important . for postoperative trauma patients with fever , traumatic , or operative complications should also be considered to differentiate them from covid-19 . attention should be paid to symptomatic and etiological treatment . postoperative dyspnea and hypoxia should also be differentiated from complications such as pulmonary embolism . nutritional support and prevention of other complications ( bacterial infection , stress ulcer , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , and deep venous thrombosis ) should also be strengthened . \n\n quarantine \n\n based on current experience , if the medical personnel complete the operation successfully and comply with all the regulations without any accidental exposure , the patient does not need to be quarantined . otherwise , a 14-day medical observation is obligatory , and timely treatment is needed when any abnormalities occur . notably , some literature recommends a routine 14-day quarantine for relevant personnel involved in the operation for sars-cov-2 confirmed patients . however , extreme safety often results in severe incapacity to help patients , so a balance between safety and efficiency must be maintained . \n\n discussion \n\n the national health commission of china initially decided to temporarily call the disease novel coronavirus pneumonia or ncp . it was not until february 12 , 2020 , that the official name covid-19 was announced by the who . shortly after the who announced the disease 's official name , the virus causing it was named sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , highlighting the new virus 's similarity to the sars virus identified in 2003 . based on epidemiological data up to jan. 4 , 2020 , the estimated r0 was 2.2 ( 95 % ci , 1.4 to 3.9 ) , while the latest study surveying cases up to feb. 14 , 2020 , further calculated that the r0 of covid-19 was 3.77 . therefore , researchers estimated that in terms of infection ability , sars-cov-2 was slightly higher than the sars virus and significantly higher than the mers-cov . according to clinical characteristic analysis of sars-cov-2 infection in china , the mortality was 2.01 % out of 28,018 cases as of feb. 6 , 2020 . by human-to-human transmission , sars-cov-2 had spread rapidly from wuhan , china , to 24 other countries as of feb. 12 , 2020 . the number of cases within china and other countries is rapidly increasing , and it is estimated that for every additional 10 % decrease in transmission rate , the peak population will be reduced by 20-47 % . the cumulative number of infected cases and deaths will be reduced by 23-49 % due to comprehensive interventions . if current interventions continue , it is expected that the number of people infected will peak in early march 2020 . based on the epidemiological analysis , only 1.18 % of the patients had direct contact with wild animals , 31.30 % of the patients had been in wuhan , and 71.80 % of the patients had contact with people from wuhan . common symptoms included fever , cough , and diarrhea . a total of 76.4 % of patients had radiologic findings manifested as pneumonia , with the remaining patients exhibiting normal radiologic findings . poor clinical outcomes can be predicted by disease severity , including oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count , and chest ct manifestations . \n\n the transmission by aerosols is still under investigation . aerosols are solid , liquid , solid , and liquid granular substances suspended in the air , such as dust , smoke , fog , and microorganisms . these may be the `` flying vehicles '' for covid-19 . covid-19 aerosols are related to the increased risk of covid-19 transmission . tracheal intubation , noninvasive ventilation , tracheotomy , manual ventilation before intubation , bronchoscopy , cardiopulmonary resuscitation , sputum suction , and other airway operations , as well as the use of electrotome , suction , and drainage , all inevitably produce a large number of aerosols . when carrying out these operations , the protection and training of medical personnel should be strengthened , and preventive measures to protect against aerosols are recommended , including n95 respirators , papr , goggles or face shields , disposable fluid-resistant gowns , and limiting the number of people in the room . \n\n based on experience from the hospital in wuhan , patients with covid-19 have high mortality after surgery . as of february 14 , 2020 , 6 gastrointestinal operations were performed in the general surgery department of the authors ' hospital ; one 60-year-old male died of respiratory failure 14 days after surgery , and one died of septic shock , for a mortality rate of 33.33 % . another group of eight covid-19 confirmed patients in zhongnan hospital of wuhan university underwent gastrointestinal surgeries ( seven gastrointestinal tumors and one benign case ) ; one patient died of covid-19 after left hemicolectomy with the diagnosis of postoperative recurrence of renal cancer involving the descending colon with intestinal obstruction , and one tumor patient died from postoperative complications of abdominal infection , for a mortality rate of 25 % . trauma patients usually have massive hemorrhage , shock , and contamination . damage control strategies should be complied with to correct fatal triads caused by hypothermia , acidosis , and coagulopathy . meanwhile , effective oxygen therapy and organ function support are also indispensable . \n\n moreover , additional attention should be paid to patients in critical condition and to those who develop severe pneumonia after trauma . among covid-19 patients , critical patients , including patients with respiratory failure , septic shock , and other organ failures , have accounted for 29 % ~32 % . identifying high-risk groups with severe illness can also help reduce the occurrence of poor prognosis . the possible high-risk groups include patients over 65 years old , patients with obesity , and patients with other diseases ( such as chronic pulmonary disease , hypertension , heart disease , kidney disease , diabetes , tumor , and immune deficiency ) . \n\n procedure for level 3 ppe doffing \n\n the covid-19 outbreak poses significant challenges to hospital staff and specifically trauma surgeons , which must offer optimal and timely care despite the circumstances . strict safety protocols must be adhered to when carrying out emergency care for patients with severe trauma and other surgical diseases , which means that all the measures shall be carried out to preserve the ability of the medical staff to achieve the purpose of effective care without sacrificing the safety of all involved . the perspectives in this paper can not be a substitute for clinical judgment and expert consultation but can help provide up-to-date guidance on the clinical management of emergency surgery for trauma patients during the outbreak of covid-19 ( fig . 4 ) . \n\n conclusion \n\n in conclusion , the covid-19 outbreak raises several issues concerning the safety of medical personnel and patients . areas with high incidence rates of covid-19 should conduct operations with caution and protection should be strengthened while ensuring suitable facilities to carry out optimal care with maximal safety . with the accumulation of clinical experience and in-depth research , some of the practices may require modification when additional

00001000	applications of 3d printing technology to address covid-19 related supply shortages \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) was first identified in an outbreak in wuhan , china on december 8 , 2019 . globally , the number of affected covid-19 patients is growing exponentially , with the death toll exceeding 27,300 as of march 27 , 2020 . worldwide , there is a limited supply of n95 respirator masks , face shields , ventilator valves , testing kits and other personal protective equipment . thus , adequate production and distribution of personal protective equipment is critical during this pandemic . to address these shortages , three-dimensional ( 3d ) printing , a novel and innovative technology used to fabricate complex architectures , is well suited . 3d printing is an adjustable , robotic platform allowing for tailored deposition of biomaterials using computer-aided design systems to formulate layer-by-layer custom designs with controlled architecture and composition . \n\n masks \n\n n95 respirators masks have two advantages over surgical , paper or cloth masks : 1 ) they are > 95 % efficient at filtering 0.3-microm airborne particles and 2 ) they are fit tested to each user to ensure an adequate seal , such that air and small droplets do not enter around the edges of the mask and into the health care worker 's breathing zone . the centers for disease control and prevention recommends n95 masks for health care workers taking care of patients with covid-19 . \n\n 3d printing can be used to produce tailored seal designs for improving mask comfort and fit . to customize face mask seals , 3d laser scanning can be implemented to scan exact facial parameters , with a tailored and customized face seal n95 template . anthropometric data of the chin arc , jawline , face and nose lengths , and nose protrusion measurements can be taken into account with this customized seal . in a study using face seal prototypes with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic using a fused deposition modeling 3d printer , three subjects showed improved contact pressure compared with use of 3m 8210 n95 ffr respirator masks . moreover , a personalized mask may account for facial hair length and density for a more precise fit . \n\n displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . the biomaterials displayed in this image have been fully characterized in the medical literature , with the same material composition of n95 masks . the mask includes several layers thereby ensure effective filtration of viral particles . \n\n figure 1 \n\n standard n95 masks consist of filtration material composed of electrostatic non-woven polypropylene ( pp ) fibers which are semi-rigid , lightweight and fatigue resistant . the semi-crystalline structure may cause significant distortion of the 3d printed parts upon cooling thereby making 3d printing difficult . material extrusion 3d printing was used to design a 3d printable thermoplastic elastomeric material from a blend of polypropylene ( pp ) and styrene- ( ethylene-butylene ) -styrene ( sebs ) . this blend provides better printability and flexibility for n95 mask design . pp is commonly used for various industrial applications due to its low cost , processability , printability , recyclability and mechanical integrity . sebs is a polymeric elastomer with low processing temperature and low distortion during extrusion . thus , the pp/sebs combination would improve the processability of 3d printed n95 masks . moreover , controlling the thermoplastic elastomer ratio allows for tailoring the flexibility and elasticity of the 3d model material for better fitted masks . 3d melt electrospinning printing can also be used to create pp microfibers with sequential layering to accurately obtain a 3d form . thus , 3d printing procedures may allow for the creation of stable and biocompatible n95 masks that are comparable to industrial manufacturing brands . figure 1 displays a potential n95 3d printed mask prototype . \n\n face shields \n\n polycarbonate and polyester , polyvinyl chloride and other synthetic polymers are commonly used to make surgical face shields . these biomaterials are transparent , lightweight and provide high optical clarity . the polymers can easily be printed using 3d technology to meet the needs of healthcare workers treating covid-19 . \n\n covid-19 specimen collection kit \n\n creating 3d printed test swabs would help increase covid-19 testing capacity . nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs can be made from a flexible polymer , using polystyrene for the shaft . the tip can be tailored to be micro fine using computer-aided design software . thereafter , swab bud lattice fibers can be made from calcium alginate using hydrogels using 3d tissue engineering . \n\n ventilator valves \n\n ventilator valves are attachments used to deliver oxygen at fixed concentrations for patients with acute respiratory distress , including covid-19 patients . 3d printing technology can be used via a filament extrusion system or a polymer-laser powder bed fusion process to print single-use valve sets . 3d printers can design the different elements of the valve using biomaterials such as polyamide and polysulfone , polycarbonate , silicone rubber and stainless steel . furthermore , these disposable valves eliminate time-consuming sterilization . \n\n medications \n\n 3d printing techniques , such as fused filament , inkjet , extrusion and powder extrusion , allow for fabrication of 3d printed pills . medication-printing technologies typically utilize a small nozzle to lay thin disc-shaped layers of powders and deposit microscopic droplets of liquid to bind the materials . a coaxial needle extrusion 3d technology was used to print active pharmaceutical ingredients and create combinations of controlled dosing of drugs . while there are no specific antivirals or vaccines for treatment of covid-19 , several well-characterized anti-viral drugs are being considered as therapies . it may be possible to use 3d medication-printing technology to effectively and rapidly print lopinavir/ritonavir , chloroquine , and hydroxychloroquine pills . thus , 3d technology has the potential to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry , making drug research , development and production applicable to covid-19 patients . \n\n as the covid-19 outbreak rapidly evolves , there has been a personal protective equipment shortage globally . 3d printing inventions can be rapidly applied to address these deficiencies . cost , processing time , testing , and manpower are potential barriers to creating 3d-printed personal protective equipment . however , the synthetic polymer biomaterials needed for 3d-printed personal protective equipment are exact or very similar in composition to the standard manufacturing grade products ( i.e . n95 masks provides the same fluid barrier and air filtration protection ) . moreover , these synthetic polymer materials are readily available and cost effective ( i.e . polypropylene is 12.47 cents per pound ) . 3d printer costs vary but are an excellent investment with labor performed via robotics . in conjunction with flattening the curve via social distancing , this pioneering technology can provide adequate personal protective equipment for health care workers on the front lines of this pandemic . \n\n abbreviations : \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) \n\n three-dimensional ( 3d ) \n\n polypropylene ( pp ) \n\n

00010010	transmission potential of the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) onboard the diamond princess cruises ship , 2020 \n\n an outbreak of covid-19 developed aboard the princess cruises ship during january-february 2020 . using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members , we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak . our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore ( approximate range : 1.1-7 ) . our findings suggest that rt decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control . most recent estimates of rt reached values largely below the epidemic threshold , indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n introduction \n\n while the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) spread rapidly throughout china for several weeks since december 2019 , the virus had not taken off outside china in part due to the unprecedented social distancing measures that the chinese government put in place . one exception is the outbreak of covid-19 that developed aboard the diamond princess ship which was detected in early february when one of its passengers , a traveler from hong kong , tested positive for the novel coronavirus . the number of cases in the diamond princess ship quickly jumped to 454 confirmed cases by february 18 , 2020 . in contrast , the total number of cases in singapore , one of the countries with the highest number of covid-19 cases after china , was only 77 at the time . \n\n accumulating evidence indicates that the novel coronavirus can spread widely in confined settings including hospitals , cruise ships , prisons , and churches . in wuhan city , china , outbreaks inside health care settings led to the infection of hundreds of health professionals . in tokyo , japan , most of the reported infections have been linked to a party inside a traditional wooden ship , called yakatabune while most of the infections in korea have affected members of one church and one hospital . \n\n tracking the evolution of the transmission potential of covid-19 in different confined settings and how it compares with that of other respiratory diseases such influenza has public health implications . when outbreaks occur in confined settings , it is useful to investigate how the effective reproduction number changes as a result of interventions strategies such as the quarantine that the japanese government imposed on travelers and crew members aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n in this study we sought to characterize the temporal variation in the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak aboard the princess cruises ship using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data by dates of symptoms onset describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members . \n\n epidemiological incidence cases \n\n in yokohama , japan , an outbreak of covid-19 has been unfolding on board the princess cruise ship , which has been under quarantine orders since february 5 , 2020 , after a former passenger of the diamond princess ship tested positive for the virus after disembarking in hong kong . as of february 22 , 2020 , two days after the scheduled two-week quarantine came to an end , a total of 621 symptomatic and asymptomatic people including one quarantine officer , one nurse and one administrative officer tested positive for covid-19 out of the 3711 passengers and crew members on board . laboratory tests by pcr that prioritize symptomatic or high-risk groups have been conducted . \n\n incidence curves of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases of covid-19 among passengers and crew members of the outbreak unfolding aboard the princess cruises ship are publicly available from the national institute of infectious diseases , japan ( niid ) website . daily time series of symptomatic patients , from january 20 , 2020 to february 18 , 2020 were extracted . however , to reconstruct the trajectory of the epidemic , only 197 cases have dates of symptoms onset are available out of a total of 300 confirmed symptomatic cases . \n\n of the 103 symptomatic cases with missing onset dates , a total of the 79 cases are passengers while 24 cases are crew members . moreover , out of the 79 passenger cases , 30 cases were reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 21 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 28 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . of 24 crew member cases , 1 case was reported from february 4 , 2020 to february 6 , 2020 , 15 cases were reported from february 7 , 2020 to february 14 , 2020 , and 8 cases were reported from february 14 , 2020 to february 19 , 2020 . \n\n epidemiological modeling \n\n we connected the daily incidence series with a discrete-time integral equation to describe the epidemic dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . specifically , let fs denote the probability mass function of the serial interval of covid-19 , where the serial interval is defined as the time from illness onset in the primary case to time of illness onset in the secondary case . then fs , of length s days , is given by \n\n for s > 0 , f ( s ) represents the cumulative distribution function of the gamma distribution . we characterized the expected number of new incident cases e [ ci , t ] in type i at symptom onset week t as follows , where rij denotes the average number of cases of type i infected by a single individual of type j . here we assume that the incidence , ci , t , follows a poisson sampling process with expected value e [ ci , t ] . \n\n the reproduction matrix for each type is given by \n\n this matrix is referred to as a next-generation matrix ( ngm ) in a fully susceptible population ( , pp . 873-885 ) . using this matrix , we derive the instantaneous time-dependent effective reproduction number , rt , for the entire transmission dynamics from the largest eigenvalue of the ngm . under the assumption that the per-contact infection probability and the generation interval are consistent over time regardless of the type of infection , the ngm quantifies the within type and inter-type patterns of transmission . the sum of the value in column j is the reproduction number for a specific type j . \n\n serial interval estimates of covid-19 were derived from previous studies of covid-19 , indicating that it follows a gamma distribution with the mean and sd at 7.5 and 3.4 days , respectively , based on ref .. the maximum value of the serial interval was fixed at 20 days as the cumulative probability distribution of the gamma distribution up to 20 days reaches 0.991 . \n\n we estimated model parameters and made projections using a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) method in a bayesian framework . point estimates and corresponding 95 % credibility intervals were drawn from the posterior probability distribution . all statistical analyses were conducted in r version 3.5.2 ( r foundation for statistical computing , vienna , austria ) and the 'rstan ' package ( no-u-turn-sampler ( nuts ) ) ( see table 1 ) . \n\n result \n\n day date event 1 jan/20/2020 departed from the

across transmission types : 5.6 ( 95 % cri : 0.3 , 10.9 ) for passenger to passenger , 0.6 ( 95 % cri : 0.1 , 1.1 ) for passenger to crew , 0.5 ( 95 % cri : 0.2 , 0.8 ) for crew to passenger , 0.5 ( 95 % cri : 0.3 , 0.8 ) for crew to crew . although vaccines are still in early development stages as of february 2020 , based on our findings , the corresponding target vaccination coverage to contain the outbreak in this confined setting were estimated at 91 % and 94 % from the maximum value of the 50 percentile distribution and the 97.5 percentile distribution , respectively . \n\n range

of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 . passenger and crew also have total ( within-type and inter-type ) rt values largely below the epidemic threshold , with only small percentages at 0 % and 9 % above the epidemic threshold , respectively ( table 3 ) . \n\n discussion \n\n this is the first study to assess the transmission potential of the covid-19 outbreak that unfolded aboard the diamond princess ship , january-february 2020 . the overall mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11 , which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in china and singapore in the range 1.1-7 . however , following the implementation of the quarantine period , the overall rt decreased substantially compared to values estimated during the early stage , but it exhibited fluctuations around the epidemic threshold , which likely prolonged the outbreak . \n\n our results indicate that rt declined following the quarantine measures implemented by the japanese government on february 5 relative to values during the early phase of the outbreak . importantly , only those passengers and crew who tested positive for the novel coronavirus were permitted to disembark the diamond princess ship , with more than 80 percentage of the passengers and crews still on board as of february 18 , 2020 . our latest overall estimate of rt at 0.35 ( 95 % cri : 0.02 , 2.19 ) with only 2 % of rt estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0 suggested a low probability of observing a subsequent outbreak aboard the diamond princess ship . \n\n our findings indicate that the passenger-to-passenger transmission type dominated the transmission dynamics aboard the diamond princess ship . the rapid increase in the overall rt from day 12 ( january 31 , 2020 ) to day 19 ( february 7 , 2020 ) is greatly influenced by the increase in passenger-to-passenger transmission , and this time period covers the time lag between february 1 , 2020 when the index covid-19 case was reported and february 5 , 2020 when the japanese government requested the passengers to stay inside their cabin after the detection of a cluster of covid-19 positive cases . upon the implementation of the quarantine orders , the overall rt and rt for passengers aboard the diamond princess ship declined thereafter , while rt among crew maintained a steady level and only started to decline on day 25 of the outbreak ( february 13 , 2020 ) . this is consistent with the fact that passengers staying inside their cabins led to a substantial decline in passenger-to-passenger transmission type except for their interaction with cabin mates . indeed , the proportion of secondary infections inside the cabins increased from 7 % ( 1/15 ) on february 6 , 43 % ( 3/7 ) on february 10 , 2020 to 100 % ( 1/1 ) on february 14 , 2020 . thus , a high proportion of the symptomatic cases after the quarantine gradually shifted from largely passenger cases to crew cases . indeed , despite their potential risk of acquiring the infection , crews had to continue to work to deliver services to isolated passengers . the distribution of the median re by transmission type suggests that other transmission types likely contributed to this outbreak to some extent ( fig . 3 ) . because one quarantine officer , one nurse , and one administrative officer contracted covid-19 aboard the diamond princess ship , the infection risk continued to be significant inside the diamond princess ship . \n\n as for the crude asymptomatic ratios by age groups , they show significant differences across age groups . however , these crude ratios are severely influenced by the timing of specimen collection relative to the infection time . hence , these ratios could be better ascertained if additional data with the timing of specimen collection becomes available . \n\n several limitations should be listed . first , a total of 103 laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases with unknown onset dates were not incorporated in our analysis . although the high proportion of unavailable data ( 34 % ( 103/300 ) ) likely influenced a downward bias in estimates of transmission potential , our estimates still point to the high transmission potential of covid-19 inside confined settings . second , it is possible that reporting delays could have influenced our latest estimates of the effective reproduction number . in fact , the us government recently sent a chartered flight to transport the american passengers on board the diamond princess ship , and after the disembarkation process , a total of 14 american passengers tested positive for the disease on february 16 , 2020 . this event also contributes to a downward bias in r although the number of cases does not exceed the peak of the outbreak , further supporting the potent transmissibility of covid-19 in confined settings . \n\n our most recent estimate of the effective reproduction number of the ongoing covid-19 epidemic on board the diamond princess ship was largely below the epidemic threshold of 1.0 , which suggested a very low probability of observing secondary outbreaks of the disease in the diamond princess ship . \n\n funding statement \n\n km acknowledges support from the japan society for the promotion of science kakenhi grant number 18k17368 and from

00000100	asymptomatic and human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 in a 2-family cluster , xuzhou , china . \n\n we report epidemiologic , laboratory , and clinical findings for 7 patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease in a 2-family cluster . our study confirms asymptomatic and human-to-human transmission through close contacts in familial and hospital settings . these findings might also serve as a practical reference for clinical diagnosis and medical treatment . 
00001000	contact transmission of covid-19 in south korea : novel investigation techniques for tracing contacts \n\n in the epidemiological investigation of an infectious disease , investigating , classifying , tracking , and managing contacts by identifying the patient 's route are important for preventing further transmission of the disease . however , omissions and errors in previous activities can occur when the investigation is performed through only a proxy interview with the patient . to overcome these limitations , methods that can objectively verify the patient 's claims ( medical facility records , global positioning system , card transactions , and closed-circuit television ) were used for the recent ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 contact investigations in south korea . \n\n introduction \n\n an epidemiological investigation aims to quickly determine the prevalence of an infectious disease whilst simultaneously revealing the cause , and source of the disease , and explore the transmission process to ultimately prevent the spread of the infectious disease . as individuals become the source of the infectious disease , and if person-to-person transmission is suspected , it is important to immediately identify , and manage people that are in close contact with suspected patients . in particular , if there are several unknown epidemiological and clinical characteristics , and an effective medical intervention is lacking ( as in the case of new infectious diseases such as covid-19 ) , contact management becomes 1 of the core strategies to minimize additional transmission . for these strategies to be successful , it is necessary to evaluate between-person exposure risk in all locations where there have been confirmed cases ( after the onset of symptoms ) , and to classify contact persons based on this risk . furthermore , it is also important to eliminate the possibility of exposure to infection in the places visited by the confirmed patient , by performing the appropriate disinfection of areas that can harbor environmental contamination . however , traditional investigative methods , depending on the patient or proxy interview , has the limitation of omissions and errors of previous activities . \n\n the covid-19 outbreak in china occurred on december 8th , 2019 , and the first case in korea was reported on january 20th , 2020 . as of february 14th , the total number of confirmed cases of covid-19 in korea was 28 . in the current epidemiological investigation contact investigation techniques that were used on a limited basis for the middle east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) outbreak in 2015 , are being used in all confirmed cases of covid-19 . \n\n this report will provide a general overview of the contact investigation from the covid-19 national emergency response center , epidemiology and case management team and describe the various methods used to evaluate exposure risk . \n\n results \n\n covid-19 contact investigation and management comprised of the following : 1 ) determination of the location of the contact ( patient route ) , 2 ) exposure risk evaluation , 3 ) contact classification , and 4 ) contact management . the location of the contact was determined through the process of preliminary identification , by interviewing patients , and their acquaintances , and by objective verification of the investigated information . exposure risk evaluation was performed depending on the route of disease transmission , patient characteristics , and environmental characteristics . based on the results of the evaluation , the contacts were classified into close and casual contacts depending on the exposure . the method of managing the classified contacts was largely distinguished between movement restriction and symptom monitoring . movement restriction is a legal public health order , and quarantine ( isolation ) , home isolation , or controlled travel is enacted . symptom monitoring was performed as either active or passive monitoring , depending on the exposure risk ( figure 1 ) . \n\n the methods used to overcome recall and confirmation biases that can occur while determining the location of the contact include checking medical facilities records , phone-based global positioning system ( gps ) , card transaction records , and closed-circuit television ( cctv ; table 1 ) . \n\n 1 . history of using medical facilities and visiting pharmacies \n\n history of using medical facilities , and visiting pharmacies was used to estimate the window of time of infection , through an accurate evaluation of the clinical symptoms of the infectious disease , and initial onset of the symptoms . if a medical facility was included in the patient 's route , quarantine of the medical facility was conducted . \n\n 2 . gps \n\n consistency in the recall of the route of the patients identified through interview was evaluated . additionally , identification of the routes that the patient could not remember was also possible . however , another person 's information can be misunderstood as the patient 's information if the phone is not owned by or carried by the patient . gps uses cellular phone networks , therefore there are limitations in identifying the exact locations of a patient 's route . \n\n 3. credit card transaction log \n\n credit card transaction logs were used to assess the consistency in the route of the patient identified through interview , and the scope of contacts was assessed by specifying the locations visited . however , if the patient did not use a credit card under their name or if another person used the patient 's card , the information may be misinterpreted . thus , rechecking the contents of the credit card log was necessary , and instances of not being able to use the information at the appropriate time may occur . \n\n 4 . cctv \n\n by checking the video footage of the location of a patient 's path , cctv provided help to identify the details of each situation . for example , cctv was used to evaluate the level of exposure risk by identifying whether the patient wore masks , or had respiratory symptoms such as a cough . the limitations of using cctv were the lengthy time required to check the cctv , and the accuracy of patient identification if the cctv was not inside the facility or the patient was in a blind spot of the camera . \n\n discussion \n\n based on the experience of the mers outbreak in 2015 , laws were revised to supplement the areas that were lacking at the time . korea centers for disease control and prevention were able to use relevant information in epidemiological investigations to contain and prevent infection , thus enabling the establishment of a more comprehensive management of infectious diseases . furthermore , making accurate information available to the general public helps to minimize fear and confusion with respect to the risk of transmissibility of the disease . the use of methods that have objectively verified the patient 's route claims ( medical facility records , gps , card transactions , and cctv ) for covid-19 contact investigations in south korea has provided accurate information on the location , and time of exposure , and details of the situation , thus reducing omissions in a patient 's route due to recall or confirmation bias that may have arisen from patient or proxy interviews . \n\n however , the publicization of a patient 's route for the public 's benefit infringes upon the privacy of the patient . thus , it is necessary to establish a protocol to protect privacy . equally , more effort should be taken to provide accurate information to the public . patient information that is unrelated to the communication of risk of infectious diseases must be protected by clearly defining the standards of publicization and reporting of patient information for the public 's benefit when an infectious disease is prevalent . \n\n with regards to responding to the recent prevalence of covid-19 , korea centers for disease control and prevention are performing defense activities to contain and prevent infection at the appropriate time , with more objective and accurate methods for monitoring patient contacts by using personal information . however , an evaluation of the effectiveness of these monitoring methods when multiple patients are involved , is necessary after the situation has been controlled . epidemiological investigations require the collaboration of various related persons and must be conducted through a strict verification process . furthermore , investigations must be performed using systematic processes with scientific methods and principles , and cycles of continuous evaluation and feedback to identify the etiology , extent , progression and therapy for the infectious disease and the development of public health policies . \n\n conflicts of interest \n\n the authors declare no competing

00001000	strategic planning to augment the testing capacity for covid-19 in india . \n\n background & objectives : nearly 5,500 tests for coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) had been conducted on march 31 , 2020 across the indian council of medical research ( icmr ) -approved public and private laboratories in india . given the need to rapidly increase testing coverage , we undertook an exercise to explore and quantify interventions to increase the daily real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qrt-pcr ) -based testing capacity over the next few months . the objective of this exercise was to prepare a potential plan to scale-up covid-19 testing in india in the public sector . methods : potential increase in daily testing capacity of the existing public laboratories was calculated across the three base scenarios of shifts ( 9 , 16 and 24 h ) . additional testing capacity was added for each shift scenario based on interventions ranging from procurement of additional qrt-pcr machines , leveraging spare capacity on available qrt-pcr machines not drafted into covid-19 testing , to in-laboratory process optimization efforts . results : moving to a 24 h working model in the existing approved laboratories can enhance the daily testing capacity to 40,464 tests/day . the capacity can be further bolstered by leveraging qrt-pcr and nucleic acid amplification test ( naat ) -based machines available with the multidisciplinary research units ( mrus ) , national aids control organisation ( naco ) and national tuberculosis elimination programme ( ntep ) . using combination/multiplex kits , and provision of automated rna extraction platforms at all laboratories could also optimize run time and contribute to capacity increase by 1.5-2 times . interpretation & conclusions : adopting these interventions could help increase public sector 's daily testing capacity to nearly 100,000-120,000 tests/day . it is important to note that utilization of the scaled-up testing capacity will require deployment of additional workforce , procurement of corresponding commodities for testing and scale-up of sample collection and transportation efforts . 
01100000	using integrated computational approaches to identify safe and rapid treatment for sars-cov-2 \n\n abstract \n\n sars-cov-2 is a new generation of coronavirus , which was first determined in wuhan , china , in december 2019 . so far , however , there no effective treatment has been found to stop this new generation of coronavirus but discovering of the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 main protease ( sars-cov-2 mpro ) may facilitate searching for new therapies for sars-cov-2 . the aim was to assess the effectiveness of available fda approved drugs which can construct a covalent bond with cys145 inside binding site sars-cov-2 main protease by using covalent docking screening . we conducted the covdock module mmgbsa module in the schrodinger suite 2020-1 , to examine the covalent bonding utilizing . besides , we submitted the top three drugs to molecular dynamics simulations via gromacs 2018.1 . the covalent docking showed that saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir and prevacid have the highest binding energies mmgbsa of -72.17 , -72.02 , -65.19 , -57.65 , -54.25 , -51.8 , and -51.14 kcal/mol , respectively . the 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation was conducted for saquinavir , ritonavir and remdesivir to evaluate the stability of these drugs inside the binding pocket of sars-cov-2 main protease . the current study provides a powerful in silico results , means for rapid screening of drugs as anti-protease medications and recommend that the above-mentioned drugs can be used in the treatment of sars-cov-2 in combined or sole therapy . \n\n communicated by ramaswamy h. sarma \n\n introduction \n\n sars-cov-2 also called 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ' abbreviated sars-cov-2 was recognized to be the causative of atypical pneumonia ( joshi , ; pant et al. , ) outbreak in wuhan , china ( hasan , ; s. a. khan et al. , 2020 ) . the virus belongs to the family known as 'coronaviruses ' because of the crown-like appearance of spikes glycoproteins on the envelope under an electron microscope ( y chen et al. , ) . world health organization ( who ) recently announced that the virus transforms from epidemic to pandemic , which requires urgent intervention to prevent the growing spread of the virus across the globe ( chan et al. , ) . the total confirmed cases 2,347,884 with 738,923 cases in the united state of america ( usa ) alone and the total death of 161,138 ( as of april 19 ) , with mortality estimated within 2 % and about 3.4 % , according to estimates of approved cases and death worldwide ( n. chen et al. , ) . the most familiar is a virus that arose from the rhinolophus bat which is > 96 % homologous with the modern sars-cov-2 virus and it is just 79 % homologous with the initial sars-cov ( fisher & heymann , ) . the fast-growing number of infected cases globally urged the world health organization to announce a state of global health emergency to correlate scientific and medical disciplines to develop rapidly an effective treatment for patients , ( morse et al. , ; sarma et al. , ) elderly patients and people with severe underlying health diseases like heart diseases , lung illness , and diabetic patients , for instance , appear to be at greater risk of revealing severe sars-cov-2 requires immediate intervention rather than waiting virus vaccine which may require 1 year to be available ( enayatkhani , ) . while drug repurposing could be a short-term and fast resolution to handle sars-cov-2 patients ( elfiky , ; r. j. khan et al. , 2020 ; kumar et al. , ) , repurposing existing drugs can offer a good choice to overcome the virus and offer better risk-versus trade-off as compared with discovering new drug and can help overcome time waiting for new therapy rather than use the available resources ( elmezayen , ; muralidharan , ) one successful repurposing drug story includes duloxetine which originally developed for depression and fda approved as the first-in-class choice for stress urinary incontinence ( sweeney & chancellor , ) , duloxetine initially created as antidepressant also is now passed to phase iii clinical trials as a first-in-class treatment for premature ejaculation ( mcmahon , ) and thalidomide , which had a tragic start as an over-the-counter sedative for morning sickness in pregnancy is now being applied to manage leprosy and multiple myeloma ( hideshima & anderson , ) . \n\n as a result of , a newly issued x-ray crystal of sars-cov-2 main protein ( mpro ) , we planning to use computational approaches ( cameron et al. , 2013 ) to contribute to find an effective treatment for sars-cov-2.thereby , computational analyses speed up these approaches since they allow to handle millions of data simultaneously ( gupta et al. , 2020 ) . molecular docking includes a set of computational methods and algorithms that aimed to identify novel relationships between chemical ligands and targets through using the modelling of their direct physical interaction ( aanouz , ; ekins et al. , ) . in present study , we attend to evaluate some of approved drugs to be as covalent binders , irreversible interactions , which can provide a powerful strategy to fight against epidemic viruses . and molecular dynamics simulations can give a more detail for the image which got from molecular covalent docking . \n\n materials and methods \n\n covalent virtual screening \n\n the crystal structure of fda-available covalent drugs which available in table 1 were selected based on the review of kumalo et al . and some of the antiviral drugs that can form a covalent bond to the target protein . and we aim also here to redirect them for other indications specially to see their possibility to fight against sars-cov-2 . thence , we searched about the chosen drugs in pubchem ( https : //pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) to identify the possibility of the selected drugs to be as covalent binders toward sars-cov-2 mpro . where , pubchem provides detailed information about the selected drugs rather than other repositories , especially , the property of drug to form covalent bond . before starting covalent docking , we downloaded the selected drugs one by one and optimize them by using the ligprep ( lim et al. , ) based on the opls_2005 force field and generated possible state employing epik in the schrodinger 2020 ( elfiky ; s. a. khan et al.,2020 ) . in the next step , the structure of sars-cov-2 mpro ( 6lu7 ) was downloaded from protein data bank ( http : //www.rcsb.org/pdb ) ( jin et al . , ) . the protease structure was optimized by adding hydrogens , removing water molecules and optimizing charge using the protein preparation wizard module ( kumalo et al. , ) in schrodinger suite 2020-1 . the covalent docking protocol was preferred since the cysteine 145 residue which is available in the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro considered as a vital residue that can form a covalent bond with the drug if it can interact covalently . the different mechanisms for the cys145-fda drug were mentioned in table 1 based on the nature of the drug so that the reactive functional group on the ligand and receptor residue are identified and the bond is formed between the correct atoms . these covalently docked complexes were created using covdock in schrodinger suite 2020-1 . finally , we selected the lowest the mmgbsa value for each drug as a propriate conformation of the drug inside the binding pocket . \n\n entry name pubchem id molecular

docking results showing type of based reaction for constructing covalent bond , docking score , glide score and rmsd . \n\n prime mm-gbsa \n\n the chosen drugs binding energies were calculated using prime mm-gbsa modules ( vijayakumar et al. , ) in the schrodinger ( 2020 ) . the best poses of selected drugs : sars-cov-2 mpro : were chosen to obtain the binding free energy calculation . prime mmgbsa is a method that combines optimized potential for liquid simulations-all atoms ( oplsaa ) force field , molecular mechanics energies ( emm ) , an sgb solvation model for polar solvation ( gsgb ) , and a non-polar solvation term ( gnp ) composed of the non-polar solvent accessible surface area and van der waals interactions . the total binding free energy : delta gbind = gcomplex - ( g-protein + gligand ) . \n\n molecular dynamics simulation \n\n molecular dynamics simulations are a decision-making process for inspections of protein-drug complexes ' stabilities ( al-khafaji & taskin tok , ) . it is used to clarify the dynamic behavior at an atomic level of biological systems , which is hard to handle in labs ( shukla et al. , ) . in the current study , we conducted molecular dynamics simulations for the top three drugs based on mmgbsa values . the got protein-drug complex structures from covalent docking were submitted to md simulations ( saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir with sars-cov-2 mpro ) . we hired gromacs 2018.1 to run 50 ns md simulations ( abraham et al. , ) . charmm 27 force field for all atoms were chosen to run md simulation ( bjelkmar et al. , ) . we used swiss param to produce the topologies of drugs ( zoete et al. , ) . all protein-drug systems were solvated with three-point transferable intermolecular potential ( tip3p ) and their charges were neutralized via adding na or cl ions . in the following step , the protein-drugs systems were energetically minimized through the steepest descent algorithm at a tolerance value of 1000 kj/mol.nm . then the equilibration with position restraint on the protein molecules for 0.1 ns using nvt and npt ensembles were done . electrostatic interactions were evaluated by particle mesh ewald summation ( darden et al. , ) . we performed the molecular dynamics simulation with no restraint on the protein molecules or ligand to determine the stability in the final step ( time step of 0.015 ns ) . rmsd , rmsf , rg , and number of hydrogen bonds were chosen to analyze md trajectories by using gromacs utilities . \n\n principal component analysis \n\n the principal component analysis ( pca ) approach was employed to calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues and their projection along with the first two principal components ( al-khafaji & taskin tok , ) . this approach is based on the protocol of gromacs 2018.1 ( abraham et al. , ) . it is used to simplify the effect of drugs on the dynamic motion of the targeted protein where it extracts the dynamic motions in simulations that are required for their biological function ( amadei et al. , ) . we got the principal component analysis from the md trajectories . a series of eigenvectors and eigenvalues were generated by diagonalizing the matrix . we chose trajectories of the protein backbone of the complexes to get 2 d-projection of motion of trajectory . \n\n results \n\n to assess the possibility of selected fda drugs to work as treatment of sars-cov-2 , the covalent docking was utilized to screen the selected library and rank them according to their binding affinities . the calculated binding free energies of some available drugs using docking score , glide gscore , and ensemble-average mm/gbsa are shown in table 1 . \n\n to validate our covalent docking results , the correlation between mmgbsa and docking score was constructed ( figure 1 ) . the binding energy mmgbsa-docking score correlation shows a good correlation ( r2 = 0.6299 ) . based on this correlation , we chose the top three ranked-mmgbsa and docking score values of fda drugs for dissection their binding modes inside the binding site . covalent docking showed that saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir , and prevacid have -72.17 , -72.02 , -65.19 , -57.65 , -54.25 , -51.8 , and -51.14 , respectively . where all the top-eight fda drugs show a higher affinity to form a covalent , irreversible bond with cys145 of sars-cov-2 mpro . here we investigated the role of molecular weight upon the affinity of selected drugs to bind covalently to cys145 , whereas 57 % of selected drugs which have molecular weight over than 600 g/mol ( figure 2 ) . and have higher free binding energy mmgbsa than -50 kcal/mol . while the ratio of selected drugs decreased to be 16 % of drugs which can form covalent bonding with over than -50 kcal/mol . surprisingly , none of the selected drugs which have a molecular weight below than 300 g/mol can form a good affinity of binding energy . this indicates that higher molecular weight covalent warheads can form stable and efficient binding energy . \n\n the correlation between mmgbsa binding energies and docking score . \n\n effect of molecular weight upon the mmgbsa binding energy . \n\n docked complex analyses \n\n what stands out in the table 1 is saquinavir has the highest binding affinity ( lowest binding energy mmgbsa of 72.17 kcal/mol ) . therefore , the deep examination of saquinavir is needed . figure 3 shows that saquinavir not only formed covalent bond of 1.81 a with cys145 but also formed five hydrogen bonds inside the pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro . in the second rank ritonavir as presented in table 1 has -72.02 kcal/mol . \n\n covalent docking analysis of saquinavir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n this high affinity resulted from covalent bond between ritonavir and cys145 of 1.82 a ( figure 4 ) through nucleophilic addition to double bond reaction besides it interacted within binding site by forming three hydrogen bonds . despite remdesivir formed covalent bond with cys145 of 1.82 a and three hydrogen bonds ( figure 5 ) and this is similar to ritonavir , but the mmgbsa value is lower than that of ritonavir this may due to nature of reaction which in remdesivir nucleophilic addition to triple bond . \n\n covalent docking analysis of ritonavir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n covalent docking analysis of remdesivir inside the sars-cov-2 mpro . \n\n molecular dynamic simulation \n\n the effect of drug-protein interactions upon dynamics of biological system is a fundamental in drug discovery thereby we used rmsd to investigate the influence of saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir upon the stability of sars-cov-2 mpro . we utilized gromacs to execute the md simulations of 50 ns for three drug-protein systems besides of apo protein . rmsd fluctuations for both apo and hollo forms were measured and presented . the rmsd was calculated to assess the overall dynamics , stability , and convergence of the various systems and the results are presented in figure 6 ( a ) . \n\n analysis of rmsd , rmsf , rg and hydrogen bonding of saquinvir-sars-cov-2 mpro , ritonavir- sars-cov-2 mpro and remdesivir- sars-cov-2 mpro . ( a ) the protein 's backbone rmsd values with respect to time . ( b ) rmsf of the protein 's backbone with respect to position of residue in the protein . ( c ) rg of the protein backbone over the entire time of md simulation . ( d ) the number of hydrogen bonds through all the time of md simulation . \n\n figure 6 ( a ) shows there is a significant decrease in the rmsd value when sars-cov-2 main protease whether it bound to saquinavir , ritonavir , or remedisivir . further analysis revealed that the rmsd average of apo sars-cov-2 main protease was 0.294 nm but when it bound to saquinavir , ritonavir , and remedisivir the rmsd averages were.01865 , 0.2130 , and 0.2053 nm , respectively . another significant aspect of md simulation is the flexibility of protein 's backbone which can be assessed through measuring rmsf value . the results of the comparative analysis between these drugs and their effects upon sars-cov-2 main protease are illustrated in figure 6 ( b ) . closer scrutiny of figure 6 ( b ) exhibits the binding of saquinavir diminished the fluctuations of the protein 's backbone . and behavior is also can be seen from figure 6 ( b ) where the binding of both ritonavir and remedisivir led to reducing the flexibility of the protein . the radius of gyration ( rg ) is a definition of system 's density , and substantially influences the folding rate and stability of proteins . rg was employed to assess the compactness of all complexes . in this work , rg values are in agreement with rmsf values where there are no significant differences between apo form and hollo forms as presented in figure 6 ( c ) . this reveals that protein remained stable and compact all through the 50 ns time . the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds is a vital aspect to give an impression about the stability of drug and protein . also , the number of hydrogen bonds is relevant to the binding scores of molecular docking process . we calculated the hydrogen bonds over time to validate the stable interactions between top three drugs and their corresponding target . as seen in the figure 6 ( d ) the ritonavir has highest order of hydrogen bonding ( the average =3.35 ) , while saquinavir has an average of 1.68 . \n\n principle component analysis ( pca ) \n\n the essential dynamic method is a tool to explore the dynamical behavior in the space of sars-cov-2 main protease combined with saquinavir , ritonavir , and remedisivir . basically , the comparison of the drug-bound sars-cov-2 mpro and drug-unbound was made as reference . in order to further understand the configurational space , we selected the first two principal components ( pc1 , pc2 ) to analyze their projection of trajectories during the simulations of ligand free and ligand bound sars-cov-2 mpro of the phase space ( shown in figure 7 ) . during the four system simulations , the results clearly show that the unbound ligand protein covered a wider region of phase space , while all three drug-protein system occupied a smaller region of phase space . especially , saquinavir reduced the essential dynamics to lowest degree of functional motions as compared with another drugs . moreover , the pca results suggest that the drug-bound sars-cov-2 mpro is more stable than ligand-unbound sars-cov-2 mpro form of sars-cov-2 mpro . in short , the pca results are also in agreement with the rmsd and rmsf results , which enhance the validity of the performed analysis . \n\n two-dimensional projection of motion of trajectory of sars-cov-2 mpro bound with drugs over the pc1 and pc2 . \n\n discussion \n\n sars-cov-2 causes major pandemic health issue since its spread across the world and can infect humans mainly respiratory system causing severe pneumonia with no vaccine and drug treatment available . prior study that have referred to the significance of molecular docking to determine effective treatment in short time ( wu , et al. , ) . in reviewing the literature , we took the advantage of possibility of fda available drugs that can be as a covalent warhead to inhibit the sars-cov-2 mpro with cys145 . an initial objective of the project was to identify effective and applicable treatment . the present study focused on the main protease ( mpro ) , especially pdb id ( 6lu7 ) as a potential target for several marketed drugs as possible therapeutic option to combat the virus to see the capability of these drugs to bind with the cysteine 145 residue which is available in the binding site of sars-cov-2 main protease . the mpro in sars-cov-2 is necessary for the proteolytic maturation of the virus targeting this protein to limit the expansion of infection by hindering the cleavage of the viral polyprotein . the most interesting finding was that the both saquinavir and ritonavir have the same affinity ( binding energy mmgbsa -72 kcal/mol ) to block binding site of sars-cov-2 with irreversible interactions . this study supports evidence from previous observations that lopinavir/ritonavir can inhibit sars-cov-2 ( lim et al. , ) . another important outcome was that the remdesivir comes in second rank with binding affinity ( mmgbsa = -65 kcal/mol ) . whereas previous research has established that remdesivir can inhibit sars-cov-2 m proenzyme through docking results . another significant finding , delavirdine computationally showed the ability to form irreversible covalent bond of -57.65 kcal/mol mmgbsa binding energy . moreover , indinavir and cefuroxime axetil exhibited the possibility to halt the pocket of sars-cov-2 mpro by forming stable interaction through covalent bonding and hydrogen bonding ( mmgbsa binding energies -54 kcal/mol ) . furthermore , oseltamivir and prevacid exhibited same affinity to bind with sars-cov-2 protease through one covalent bond and one hydrogen bond ( -51 kcal/mol ) , which is a good explanation for the activity of oseltamivir ( peeri et al. , ) . in this study , results obtained show the binding affinity of drugs to an active site depends on several factors mainly the ability of a compound to form a covalent bond with amino acid residues of the mpro ( cys145 ) and length of a covalent bond , the number of h-bonds that can form with a pocket of the active site and type of nucleophilic addition of unsaturated bonds . in this concept , the structural features in saquinavir and ritonavir like free amine group ( -nh2 ) , hydroxyl groups ( -oh ) , carbonyl groups ( c=o ) in addition to ether group play key structural feature to form h-bond . results show the promising activities for antiretroviral drugs saquinavir that used for hiv/aids more than ritonavir and remdesivir followed by lopinavir as the best drugs to bind covalently toward sars-cov-2 mpro with lowest energy of binding . as discussed above , saquinavir , ritonavir , remdesivir , delavirdine , cefuroxime axetil , oseltamivir , and prevacid showed the ability to block the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro by forming covalent bond and stabilized with hydrogen bonding . \n\n these outcomes are contrary to that of kandeel and al-nazawi ( 2020 ) , they found that ribavirin , telbivudine , vitamin b12 , and nicotinamide can be can form non-bonding interactions . whilst our results showed that , saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir can form irreversible interactions , which are considered an effective way for viral infections . \n\n in the present work , comparative molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir on the conformational and dynamical demeanor in either apo or hollo forms to understand the inhibitory possibility at atomic level . an initial mission of the project was to identify rapid , effective , safe , and available for large proportions of people , so we run covalent docking and mmgbsa to sift the possibility of these drug to form irreversible interactions . therefore , we had chosen these drugs because they carry covalent warheads that can bind covalently to the target . but the docking results are not adequate , so we run md simulations examine how much these drugs are able to form stable interactions with targeted protein . one interesting finding is the rmsd of protein backbone in apo status has higher average value , whereas the binding with top three drugs diminished these rmsd average . another important finding was that the rmsf of protein 's backbone be less flexible when it compared to apo form of sars-cov-2 main protease . it is somewhat surprising that the binding of three drugs have not noted in rg values . it is not yet clear whether the top three drugs can show an evidence to inhibit the targeted protein , thereby we lean on the principal component analysis to analyze the md trajectories to judge without dispute . the most obvious finding to emerge from 2d pca analysis is that the binding of under investigated drugs caused stately impact on essential dynamics of protein by reducing its essential dynamics to its least possible motions . these results seem to be consistent with rmsd results . a possible explanation for this might be that binding of the drugs make the binding site much narrower due to hydrogen bindings this makes the 3d structure of targeted protein more rigid so it will lose its biological functions . it is possible , therefore , that using these available drugs in two ways : either alone or in combined way . these findings suggest the possible use of nominated drugs against sars-cov-2 in short time as approved by covalent docking screening . also , the present results are significant in at least directing the clinicians to use these safe drugs to stop development of corona virus and second giving hope that available drugs that can be efficient treatment . \n\n conclusions \n\n coronavirus today emphasizes as a potential threat to all people worldwide . although extensive researches have been directed to stop sars-cov-2 , but till now there is no medication . meanwhile , the spreading with complicated crisis requires immediate therapy to overcome the spread and minimize mortality of sars-cov-2 . the aim of the present study was to discover effective treatment through repurposing some of available fda-approved drugs against sars-cov-2 mpro . where , they can provide covalent warheads in virtual screening . the most prominent finding to emerge from this study is that the affinity of covalent binder toward sars-cov-2 mpro is ranked : saquinavir > ritonavir > remdesivir > delavirdine > cefuroxime axetil > oseltamivir = prevacid . one of the more noteworthy findings in this study is that md simulation analysis that saquinavir , ritonavir , and remdesivir can form stable interaction inside the binding site of sars-cov-2 mpro . also , they restricted the essential motions of protein . overall , the results of screening toward mpret encourage for further clinical evaluations . they can be easy to reach and exploit as persuasive treatments for sars-cov-2 . \n\n acknowledgements \n\n authors thankful for staff membered of gaziantep university institute of health sciences , department of bioinformatics and computational biology . \n\n

00001000	strength , weakness , opportunity , threat ( swot ) analysis of the adaptations to anatomical education in the united kingdom and republic of ireland in response to the coivd-19 pandemic . \n\n the covid-19 pandemic has driven the fastest changes to higher education across the globe , necessitated by social distancing measures preventing any face to face teaching . this has led to an almost immediate switch to distance learning by higher education institutions . anatomy faces some unique challenges . intrinsically , anatomy is a three-dimensional subject that requires a sound understanding of the relationships between structures , often achieved by the study of human cadaveric material , models and virtual resources . this study sought to identify the approaches taken in the united kingdom and republic of ireland to deliver anatomical education through online means . data were collected from 14 different universities in the united kingdom and republic of ireland and compared adopting a thematic analysis approach . once themes were generated , they were collectively brought together using a strength , weakness , opportunity , threat ( swot ) analysis . key themes included the opportunity to develop new online resources and the chance to engage in new academic collaborations . academics frequently mentioned the challenge that time constrains could place on the quality and effectiveness of these resources ; especially as in many cases the aim of these resources is to compensate for a lack of exposure to cadaveric exposure . comparisons of the actions taken by multiple higher education institutions reveals the ways that academics have tried to balance this demand . discussions will facilitate decisions being made by higher education institutions regarding adapting the curriculum and assessment methods in anatomy . 
00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region , presented to the emergency with a 3-day history of headaches , dizziness , intermittent nausea , and vomiting . brain mr showed a tumor that was entirely confined within the third ventricle , causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the child has an uncomplicated recovery after surgery , and covid-19 was eventually ruled out after a 14-day quarantine . \n\n finally , we have some additional tips for conducting surgery under level 3 precautions . a comfortable goggle and use of antifogging agent are very helpful . in addition , surgeons should avoid unnecessary conversation and perform the surgery as gently as possible to prevent splashing blood in a negative pressure operating room . \n\n neuro-oncology patients may become infected with covid-19 , and thus surgery for these patients can not be avoided . as neurosurgeons , it is crucial that we do our utmost to care for our patients while ensuring our own safety at the same time . in these challenging times , we have faith that through our concerted efforts , this pandemic will be overcome soon . \n\n publisher 's note \n\n springer nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations . \n\n compliance with ethical

00001000	'let us help'- why senior medical students are the next step in battling the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n as senior medical students in the uk , we read dr stein 's letter on the novel coronavirus ( covid-19 ) 2 and began wondering where we fit in , in this pandemic . as the government heads into a 'war footing ' 13 , there is an increased need for medical staff . there is speculation of bringing back retired doctors , many of who fall into at risk categories . with clinical placement and exams cancelled , we are determined to use our hard-earned skills in some way , to help in what is the biggest global emergency of our lifetime . 
00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region , presented to the emergency with a 3-day history of headaches , dizziness , intermittent nausea , and vomiting . brain mr showed a tumor that was entirely confined within the third ventricle , causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the child has an uncomplicated recovery after surgery , and covid-19 was eventually ruled out after a 14-day quarantine . \n\n finally , we have some additional tips for conducting surgery under level 3 precautions . a comfortable goggle and use of antifogging agent are very helpful . in addition , surgeons should avoid unnecessary conversation and perform the surgery as gently as possible to prevent splashing blood in a negative pressure operating room . \n\n neuro-oncology patients may become infected with covid-19 , and thus surgery for these patients can not be avoided . as neurosurgeons , it is crucial that we do our utmost to care for our patients while ensuring our own safety at the same time . in these challenging times , we have faith that through our concerted efforts , this pandemic will be overcome soon . \n\n publisher 's note \n\n springer nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations . \n\n compliance with ethical

00001000	experiences of practicing surgical neuro-oncology during the covid-19 pandemic \n\n to the editor , \n\n since the beginning of 2020 , the novel coronavirus disease known as covid-19 emerged to become an unprecedented global pandemic . by april 5 , 2020 , the confirmed cases have exceeded 1 million and 57 , 206 deaths have been reported globally . the latest study from china indicated that cancer patients were at higher risk of covid-19 infection and had poorer outcomes than the general population . patients with tumors of the central nervous system face multiple challenges , not just due to their immunocompromised state , which makes them more susceptible to infection , but also due to the need for extreme caution when performing treatments including surgery . we are also faced with significantly altered hospital systems , as well as shortage of medical supplies . here , we share our current experience in the surgical management of patients with cns tumors during the covid-19 pandemic . \n\n our first strategy is triage . patients with cns tumor were classified at initial visit according to their diagnoses and clinical status . patients who required routine follow-up were encouraged to take advantage of virtual healthcare options using online medical platforms . for the patients with tumors that are more likely benign or low grade gliomas , and if they are asymptomatic , elective surgery would be postponed until a safer time . meanwhile , for patients with malignant tumors such as higher grade gliomas or benign tumor with severe symptoms , surgical intervention should be scheduled in a timely manner , since delay in surgery could reduce the chance of treatment success . for emergency cases , such as patients with acute hydrocephalus or cerebral herniation , surgery must be arranged immediately . in these cases , the results of covid-19 testing may not be available prior to surgery , and thus the surgery should be performed under strict precautions to minimize possible exposure to the novel coronavirus . \n\n hierarchical protection is another important tactic in our current practice . we now adopt three levels of protection to avoid occupational exposure to novel coronavirus during surgery . based on current chinese guidelines for aerosol transmissible diseases , precautions for health care professionals are currently categorized into 3 levels , with level 1 being the lowest level of precaution , and level 3 being the highest . level 1 precautions requires the use of a surgical cap , surgical face mask , protective gown and gloves . level 3 precaution requires surgical cap , n95 face mask , goggles , face shield , full face piece respirator , protective gown , gloves . all patients admitted for surgery must undergo `` covid-19 screening '' , including contact tracing , symptoms interrogation , novel coronavirus nucleic acid and antibody test , and chest ct scan . specific precautions will then depend on the results of pre-procedural screening . a variety of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) are advised to choose for each level . to be specific , patients who are confirmed covid-19 negative could be operated under level 1 precautions as in low risk areas . for patients who are suspected of having covid-19 but who require emergency surgery , or patients from a high risk area , the tertiary health care facility must be equipped to perform the surgery . patients who are covid-19 positive should be transferred to the designated hospitals for accepting covid-19 positive patients , with the exception of emergency cases , in which case the operation should be carried out under level 3 precautions . besides appropriate ppe , a negative pressure operating room and corresponding intensive care unit ( icu ) support are indispensable in the management of these patients . \n\n operation for tumor of the third ventricle in a patient who was suspected of having covid-19 infection \n\n we now describe a case with suspected covid-19 infection who received surgery at the second affiliated hospital of zhejiang university college of medicine . an 8-year-old boy from wenzhou , a covid-19 high risk region , presented to the emergency with a 3-day history of headaches , dizziness , intermittent nausea , and vomiting . brain mr showed a tumor that was entirely confined within the third ventricle , causing obstructive hydrocephalus . the patient 's covid-19 screening was negative . due to progressive symptoms of intracranial hypertension , craniotomy for tumor resection was scheduled for the day after admission . the child then developed symptoms of cough , sneezing , and a mild rise in temperature to 37.6 c. the patient was strongly suspected of having covid-19 even though chest ct scan was negative and the initial nucleic acid test demonstrated a negative result . the surgery was thus performed under the level three precautions in a negative pressure operating room ( fig . 1 ) . the child has an uncomplicated recovery after surgery , and covid-19 was eventually ruled out after a 14-day quarantine . \n\n finally , we have some additional tips for conducting surgery under level 3 precautions . a comfortable goggle and use of antifogging agent are very helpful . in addition , surgeons should avoid unnecessary conversation and perform the surgery as gently as possible to prevent splashing blood in a negative pressure operating room . \n\n neuro-oncology patients may become infected with covid-19 , and thus surgery for these patients can not be avoided . as neurosurgeons , it
