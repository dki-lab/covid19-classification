18156123	The 1918–1919 influenza pandemic in England and Wales: spatial patterns in transmissibility and mortality impact	http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2596813?pdf=render	Spatial variations in disease patterns of the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic remain poorly studied. We explored the association between influenza death rates, transmissibility and several geographical and demographic indicators for the autumn and winter waves of the 1918–1919 pandemic in cities, towns and rural areas of England and Wales. Average measures of transmissibility, estimated by the reproduction number, ranged between 1.3 and 1.9, depending on model assumptions and pandemic wave and showed little spatial variation. Death rates varied markedly with urbanization, with 30–40% higher rates in cities and towns compared with rural areas. In addition, death rates varied with population size across rural settings, where low population areas fared worse. By contrast, we found no association between transmissibility, death rates and indicators of population density and residential crowding. Further studies of the geographical mortality patterns associated with the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic may be useful for pandemic planning.	INTRODUCTION  Greater understanding of past influenza pandemic patterns is key for designing more efficient public health interventions for future outbreaks. Despite the growing interest in historical epidemiological studies, spatial variations in the transmissibility and mortality rates of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic have yet to be carefully quantified. In addition, little is known about the comparative dynamics of influenza in cities and rural areas in general, mostly due to the lack of appropriate data at this scale for inter-pandemic and pandemic seasons.Transmissibility can be quantified by the reproduction number (R), the average number of secondary cases generated by an index case, which determines the intensity and types of interventions required to avert an epidemic (Anderson & May 1991; Diekmann & Heesterbeek 2000) . Past research has estimated that the reproduction number of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic ranged between 1.5 and 5.4 (Mills et al. 2004; Gani et al. 2005; Chowell et al. 2006 Chowell et al. , 2007a Ferguson et al. 2006; Sertsou et al. 2006; Viboud et al. 2006a; Massad et al. 2007; Nishiura 2007; Andreasen et al. in press) , depending on the specific location and pandemic wave considered, type of data, estimation method and level of spatial aggregation, which has ranged from small towns of a few hundred people to entire nations with several million inhabitants. The variability in published R estimates suggests that local factors, including geographical and demographic characteristics, could play a role in disease transmissibility.In parallel, large variations in the 1918-1919 pandemic mortality rates have been reported between different nations and cities in the US, and were linked to differences in socio-demographic conditions and public health interventions (Murray et al. 2006; Bootsma & Ferguson 2007; Hatchett et al. 2007 ). The differences between urban and rural areas and population units of varying size, however, have not been comprehensively analysed.Here we quantify geographical patterns during the autumn and winter waves of the 1918-1919 pandemic in English and Welsh cities, towns and rural areas. We analyse weekly influenza mortality from a diversity of geographical units to explore how transmissibility and mortality rates varied locally with socio-demographic factors, including population size, population density, residential crowding and urbanization.  MATERIAL AND METHODS  (a) Data sources National vital registration began in 1837 in England and Wales. Weekly numbers of influenza-specific deaths covering 46 weeks from 29 June 1918 to 10 May 1919 were compiled from an official publication of the British Ministry of Health (Ministry of Health 1920), and have been made partially available online (Influenza Pandemic Mortality in England and Wales 2006, http://ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/collection. htm?uriZhist-4350-11918-1919) . In England and Wales, as in other European countries, the 1918-1919 pandemic occurred in three major waves (Low 1920; Andreasen et al. in press; figure 1): a summer wave, associated with low mortality (29 June to 3 August 1918); an autumn wave with high mortality (12 October to 28 December 1918); and a winter wave with intermediate mortality (8 February to 5 April 1919). Here we focus on the autumn 1918 and winter 1919 waves due to better resolution in the mortality data.The mortality data covered all of England and Wales, and were available at the refined spatial scale of administrative units (NZ305), as well as the coarser scale of counties (NZ62) (Ministry of Health 1920). A total of 247 towns and cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants were categorized as urban units, and London was considered as a single unit. The remaining 58 units comprised rural areas, including 42 'remainder of counties' classified as non-urban locales by the Ministry of Health and 16 peripheral administrative counties that did not contain a single city or town (of which 11 were located in Wales).Demographic data for the 305 administrative units and 62 counties were retrieved from the 1921 decennial census (A Vision of Britain 2006), and included total population size, surface area, number of dwellings and number of rooms occupied. From these data, we derived measures of population density and residential crowding (table 1) and calculated the weekly and cumulative death rates for each geographical unit and pandemic wave. Although no census was conducted in 1918, the demographic data from the 1911 and 1921 census had very similar geographical patterns (correlationO0.99), so that our 1921 demographic estimates were deemed appropriate for the study of the 1918-1919 pandemic geographical patterns. Given the spatial aggregation of the dataset, some of the rural units had large total population sizes, but population density (defined as the ratio of population size to surface area) was 14 times lower on average in rural areas than in cities and towns.(b) Transmissibility of the autumn and winter pandemic waves (reproduction number, R) (i) Estimation methods We estimated the reproduction number in each geographical unit and during each pandemic wave, relying on the early ascending phase of local epidemic curves, where saturation effects arising from the depletion of susceptible individuals can be neglected (Anderson & May 1991) . We assumed an initial exponential growth and estimated the intrinsic growth rate, 'r', by fitting a straight line (with slope r and intercept b) to the initial increase in weekly deaths (in logarithmic scale). The longest epidemic period consistent with exponential growth was determined by the goodness-of-fit test statistic (Chowell et al. 2007a ). The reproduction number was calculated by substituting the estimate for r into an expression derived from the linearization of the classical susceptibleexposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) transmission model (Lipsitch et al. 2003; Wallinga & Lipsitch 2007 )where 1/b 1 and 1/b 2 are the mean latent and infectious periods, respectively. This expression for R assumes exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods, and the mean generation interval between two successive cases is given by T c Z1/b 1 C1/b 2 . We carried out a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of this assumption on the R estimates. We derived an upper bound for the extreme case of a fixed generation interval (delta distribution) using the following equation ( Wallinga & Lipsitch 2007) : There is considerable debate about the duration of the generation interval for influenza (Andreasen et al. in press) , with the most recent estimates relying on seasonal influenza transmission in households (Cauchemez et al. 2004; Ferguson et al. 2006) , while no data are available for pandemic influenza. Given the uncertainty, we considered two extreme values of the generation interval used in past research: a short interval of 3 days (where the latent and infectious periods were both set to 1.5 days; Ferguson et al. 2005 Ferguson et al. , 2006 Wallinga & Lipsitch 2007) and a longer interval of 6 days (latent periodZ1.9 days and infectious periodZ4.1 days; Longini et al. 2004; Mills et al. 2004 ). The case fatality rate was set to 2%, as in a previous transmissibility study (Mills et al. 2004 ).(ii) Heterogeneity in influenza transmissibility and association with socio-demographic factors We explored whether there was a meaningful variability in the reproduction number of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic across England and Wales by comparing the variability in the R estimates between and within counties. We estimated the within-county variability from the finer spatial scale of administrative units, and used the analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test the county-specific differences in transmissibility ( Neter & Wasserman 1974) .The association between reproduction number and sociodemographic variables was explored via Spearman correlations, using a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.(c) Cumulative influenza death rates for the autumn and winter pandemic waves (i) Death rates, population size and urbanization We initially explored the association between death rates, census variables and urbanization, by correlation and multivariate regression. We identified population size and urbanization as statistical predictors of death rates. We characterized these relationships further by applying two methods derived from econometrics and previously applied in infectious disease epidemiology, the Lorenz curve and the summary Gini index (Lee 1997; Woolhouse et al. 1997; Kerani et al. 2005; Green et al. 2006) . The Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of the cumulative distribution of a quantity representing in our case the proportion of deaths assumed by the bottom y% of population sizes. If all death rates are perfectly equal, the Lorenz curve is the first diagonal (no heterogeneity), while a perfectly unbalanced distribution appears as a vertical line (maximum heterogeneity, for instance, if all units except one had zero deaths). Most empirical distributions of death rates lie somewhere in between.The Gini index is a summary statistic of the Lorenz curve, ranging between 0 and 1, calculated as the area between the Lorenz curve and the diagonal representing perfect equality.A large Gini index indicates highly heterogeneous death rates. Conversely, a Gini index of zero represents an absence of heterogeneity, so that death rates are directly proportional to population size.(ii) Scaling laws Next, we characterized the functional relationship between population size and cumulative number of influenza deaths. Influenza deaths follow a power-law function of population sizes if DfN g , where D denotes number of deaths; N indicates population size; and g is an exponent to be estimated. For gZ1.0, deaths are exactly proportional to population size (i.e. no heterogeneity); g!1 indicates that low population units have higher per capita death rates, while the opposite is true for gO1.(d) Timing of pandemic onset and socio-demographic factors Finally, for the autumn and winter waves, we explored whether the timing of the local pandemic onset varied with socio-demographic characteristics. The onset week was defined for each pandemic wave and geographical unit as the first week associated with a monotonic increase in weekly deaths, up to the week of peak deaths.  RESULTS  (a) Transmissibility of the autumn and winter pandemic waves (i) Reproduction number estimates (R) Figure S1 in the electronic supplementary material shows the distribution of the reproduction number estimates for the autumn and winter waves of the 1918-1919 pandemic in England and Wales, at the refined spatial scale of administrative units (NZ305) and the coarser scale of counties (NZ62). Most locations experienced an initial epidemic phase lasting at least three epidemic weeks, so that R estimates derived from equation (2.1) could be obtained in 87% of administrative units and 100% of the counties for the autumn wave, and 69% of the units and 87% of the counties for the winter wave. Normal probability plots indicated that R estimates at the county level closely followed a normal distribution, while the distributions of estimates at the administrative unit level showed a greater frequency of high values compared with a normal distribution (not shown). In table 2, the summary estimates of R are presented for a short and long duration of the generation interval (3 and 6 days). For the shorter generation interval in the autumn wave, the mean R was found to be 1.40 (95% CI: 1.38-1.42) in the administrative units, with similar values at the county level. The mean R estimate based on the aggregated national pandemic wave was not different, at 1.39 Assuming the extreme case of fixed latent and infectious periods, we can give an upper bound on the estimates of R ( Wallinga & Lipsitch 2007) . In this sensitivity analysis, the R estimates increased only marginally, by 0.05 and 0.2 on average, when using the generation intervals of 3 and 6 days, respectively.Overall, the autumn wave showed higher transmissibility than the winter wave, with 62% of the administrative units experiencing a reduction of transmissibility from autumn to winter (see figure S2 in the electronic supplementary material for maps of R estimates). There was no correlation between the reproduction numbers in the autumn and winter waves.(ii) Heterogeneity in transmissibility and relationship with socio-demographic factors Geographical heterogeneity in influenza transmissibility was statistically significant in the autumn (ANOVA, pZ0.02) but not in the winter (ANOVA, pZ0.11). There was no difference in transmissibility between urban and rural areas for either wave (Wilcoxon test, pO0.38).The associations between R estimates and sociodemographic factors were weak to moderate, with the highest correlation estimated at 0.42 ( pZ0.002, table 3). It should be noted that there was a moderate but significant correlation between the transmissibility in the winter wave and the two measures of residential crowding at the county level (number of people per room and number of people per dwelling). However, no socio-demographic factor was consistently associated with transmissibility at both spatial scales or for both pandemic waves.(b) Cumulative death rates in the autumn and winter waves (i) Overall patterns, rural and urban areas The average influenza mortality rate was 0.27% (s.d.Z0.26%) in the autumn and 0.1% in the winter (s.d.Z0.09%), with 94% of the administrative units experiencing decreasing rates from autumn to winter (maps of mortality rates are shown in figure S3 of the electronic supplementary material). Death rates in the autumn and winter waves were weakly correlated (rZ0.19, pZ0.007). A striking difference was found with urbanization, with 30-40% higher per capita death rates in urban areas than rural areas, for both pandemic waves ( Wilcoxon test: autumn wave, pZ0.007; winter wave, pZ0.0001; figure S4 in the electronic supplementary material).(ii) Relationship with socio-demographic factors Table 4 presents the correlations between influenza death rates and demographics for urban and rural units, counties and pandemic waves. The strongest relationship was found with population size in rural settings, where the highest death rates were observed in the areas with the lowest population size-a pattern that was consistent for both pandemic waves. By contrast, there was no association seen for urban areas, and no relationship between death rates and population density. Death rates were weakly associated with an indicator of residential crowding (the average number of people per room) at both spatial scales in cities and towns, but only for the winter wave. Stepwise multivariate regression identified population size and urbanization as the only predictors of death rates in the autumn and winter waves.(iii) Modelling death rates as a function of urbanization and population size The relationship between the cumulative number of influenza deaths in a geographical area and the population size of the area can be visualized through the Lorenz curves (figure 2). The curve for rural areas was far from the diagonal for both pandemic waves (Gini index between 0.23 and 0.27), thus confirming a systematic relationship between death rates and population size in rural locations. By contrast, there was no association in urban areas (Gini index!0.05). Interestingly, variability in death rates entirely disappeared when the data were aggregated at the county level (Gini indexw0). We also characterized the relationship between population size and cumulative influenza deaths using a powerlaw function (DfN g ), stratified by urban and rural areas (figure 3). For rural areas, the exponent g estimates ranged between 0.71 and 0.77 (significantly below 1.0), whereas these estimates were approximately 1.0 for cities and towns. These estimates suggest that, in rural settings, smaller population units suffered a disproportionately large per capita mortality burden, whereas there was little variation in death rates across cities and towns. In line with the Lorenz curve analysis, heterogeneities disappeared at the scale of counties, and death rates became nearly independent of population size.(c) Timing of pandemic onset and socio-demographic factors Units with large population size experienced an early pandemic onset, both for the autumn and winter waves (figure 4). There was an approximately three-week difference on average between onset in the high and low population units in the autumn wave, while the winter wave was more synchronized, with an average difference of one week. Population size was well correlated with the The 1918-1919 influenza pandemic G. Chowell et al. 505 timing of the onset of the autumn and winter waves (K0.55%Spearman r%K0.50, p!0.001). The association was maintained when the data were stratified by rural and urban units, which suggests that population size, rather than urbanization, was the predominant factor driving timing of pandemic onset. Population size was the only socio-demographic factor that independently predicted the timing of the onset for both pandemic waves.  DISCUSSION  We explored the geographical and demographic patterns of transmissibility and mortality during the autumn and winter waves of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in England and Wales, using weekly epidemiological time series at various levels of spatial aggregation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first population study of the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic at such a detailed spatial resolution. Our estimates of the reproduction number ranged between 1.3 and 1.9, with a low level of spatial variation across geographical units, which was only marginally associated with socio-demographic factors. By contrast, there was a marked spatial heterogeneity in death rates, which was linked to urbanization, with 30-40% higher rates in cities and towns than in rural areas on average. We evidenced further variations in death rates across rural settings, where smaller population units fared worse. Urban death rates did not vary with population size.There are several caveats and assumptions in our study. As in several previous studies (Mills et al. 2004; Viboud et al. 2004 Viboud et al. , 2006a , we assumed that influenza mortality was a good proxy for disease incidence and was appropriate for the estimation of transmissibility. Our analyses were conducted with the assumption that reporting and coding of death certificates were homogeneous across England and Wales and over the course of the pandemic (vital statistics had been in place since 1837 in England and Wales, and all deaths were medically certified in 1918). One may expect that more remote locations would have poorer reporting or coding of deaths; however, we found higher death rates in rural units with lower population sizes, which argues against such bias. Finally, as in previous mortality studies (Ministry of Health 1920; Smallman-Raynor et al. 2004; Johnson 2006) , we relied on the administrative divisions of England and Wales in 1918, which are not necessarily the most meaningful spatial units for disease dynamics.We identified spatial variations in the R estimates for the autumn wave at the county level; these variations were not simply the result of measurement error, but there was no obvious association with the socio-demographic factors under study. For comparison, a previous analysis of the 1918 flu pandemic in 45 US cities found that the transmissibility of the autumn wave was weakly correlated with population density (Mills et al. 2004) , and a study of measles in 60 cities in England and Wales during the pre-vaccination era no. of deaths (log) Figure 3 . Power-law relationship between the total number of influenza deaths and population size, following D~N g (D, deaths; N, population size; g, exponent), by pandemic wave and spatial scale. The dashed lines represent the best linear fits to the data in log-log scale. The solid black line with a slope of one is shown as a reference to illustrate constant death rates with population size. (a) 305 units, autumn; (b) 62 counties, autumn; (c) 305 units, winter; (d ) 62 counties, winter. At the refined spatial scale of administrative units, the slope is 'sublinear' for rural areas (red circles, nZ58; gZ0.71 (95% CI: 0.60 -0.83) in autumn and gZ0.77 (0.64-0.90) in winter, significantly below 1.0). By contrast for urban areas, the slope is not different from one (blue circles, nZ247; gZ0.92 (0.84 -1.0) in autumn and gZ0.94 (0.85-1.03) in winter). At the county level, the power-law exponent was estimated to be 1.02 (0.96 -1.08) and 1.08 (1.01-1.14) for the autumn and winter waves, respectively. found that transmissibility was not associated with population size (Bjornstad et al. 2002) . It is interesting that influenza and measles transmissibility appear nearly invariant across a wide range of population sizes and densities, and despite the differences in social connectivity patterns in urban and rural settings. It would be interesting to study this relationship further for seasonal flu epidemics or geographical regions with greater variations in sociodemographic factors.We found similar transmissibility estimates in the autumn and winter pandemic waves for three different levels of spatial aggregation, including the administrative units, the counties and the entire region of England and Wales. On average, our autumn estimates using a generation interval of 6 days were slightly lower than estimates for the autumn 1918 pandemic wave in the US cities (Mills et al. 2004; Chowell et al. 2007a ) and higher than estimates for recent seasonal influenza epidemics (Chowell et al. 2007b) . While the estimates were not substantially changed by the spatial aggregation of the data or by relaxing assumptions on the distribution of the latent and infectious periods, they did change with different assumptions on the duration of the generation interval. Hence, the generation interval is clearly a key parameter with considerable residual uncertainty ( Ferguson et al. 2006; Andreasen et al. in press) .Our results indicate that areas with larger populations experienced early pandemic onset in the autumn and winter waves, thus suggesting a hierarchical spread of influenza driven by large population centres of England and Wales in 1918 (see also Smallman-Raynor et al. 2004 ). This pattern is reminiscent of seasonal influenza epidemics in the USA ( Viboud et al. 2006b ). Despite these observed variations in pandemic timing, it is noteworthy that the 1918-1919 pandemic as a whole was more synchronous in the administrative units of England and Wales than in US cities. The relative synchrony of the pandemic in England and Wales is likely to be explained by strong population mixing and the small geographical extent of this region ( Ferguson et al. 2006; Bootsma & Ferguson 2007) .Past research has produced conflicting results on the association between the disease burden of the 1918-1919 pandemic and socio-demographic or geographical factors. In a study of four British cities, no association was found between influenza attack rates and residential crowding (Ministry of Health 1920). Furthermore, influenzarelated mortality rates were moderately associated with measures of density and baseline pre-pandemic mortality rates in 45 US cities (Pearl 1921; Bootsma & Ferguson 2007) . Similarly, in this study, we did not find any obvious association between death rates and measures of population density or residential crowding, or between death rates and pre-pandemic infant mortality rates (correlation approx. 0.30, not shown). Other studies, by contrast, have reported a strong effect of socio-demographic characteristics on the 1918-1919 pandemic mortality rates, including per capita income and indicators of wealth such as apartment size (Mamelund 2006; Murray et al. 2006 ). These conflicting results may stem from the differences in the spatial scale considered (ranging from household to country) and the choice of socio-demographic indicators.The most important factor associated with death rate in our study was urbanization, with cities and towns experiencing approximately 30-40% higher death rates than rural areas during both pandemic waves. Although the reasons for this pattern remain unclear, a similar mortality pattern has been evidenced in New Zealand ( McSweeny et al. 2007) . Differential exposure to tuberculosis could have played a role, as this disease has been put forward as a predisposing factor for morbidity and mortality during the 1918 influenza pandemic (Pearl 1919; Noymer & Garenne 2000) , and tuberculosis was traditionally more prevalent in urban than rural settings. Alternative hypotheses include remoteness and greater social distancing in rural areas (McSweeny et al. 2007) , although in this case, we would perhaps expect lower transmissibility in rural areas. The 1918-1919 influenza pandemic G. Chowell et al. 507 Further differences with urbanization were uncovered in our study, in that death rates varied with population size in rural areas, but not in cities and towns. Disparities in access and organization of health care in rural areas with small populations, which fared worse during the pandemic, could explain these geographical patterns (McSweeny et al. 2007) .It is interesting that important residual variability in transmissibility estimates and death rates remained unexplained in our study. We think it unlikely that local differences in population age structure or public health interventions could have played a role. Children are believed to drive disease spread locally within cities or small communities ( Monto 1999) , although they probably do not disseminate infection over large distances ( Viboud et al. 2006b ). In our study, the proportion of the population comprising children did not explain geographical variations in transmissibility or death rates of the 1918-1919 pandemic (not shown). Although the 1918-1919 pandemic virus was characterized by an unusual age pattern of deaths concentrated among young adults (Olson et al. 2005) , the local differences in the proportion of young adults did not explain variations in death rates in our study (not shown). Public health interventions are irrelevant in the context of England and Wales, as no intervention was implemented in 1918-1919, in contrast to the USA (Bootsma & Ferguson 2007) . The existence of cross-immunity between the viruses circulating in successive waves of the 1918-1919 pandemic has been hypothesized (Anon. 1919; Andreasen et al. in press) , and may affect the geographical patterns described in this study. The cross-immunity hypothesis relies on anecdotal evidence supporting the idea that individuals who were infected with influenza during the summer escaped clinical illness or experienced only mild respiratory symptoms in the autumn (Anon. 1919) . Accordingly, Scandinavia experienced a large influenza morbidity wave in the summer of 1918, followed by a second wave of low mortality impact in the autumn, relative to other countries (Andreasen et al. in press). We were not able to fully investigate the impact of differential exposure to influenza during the summer of 1918 in England and Wales, due to the lack of morbidity data and extremely low death counts for this period. However, we found a weak but significant correlation between mortality rates in the summer and autumn waves, which is consistent with the cross-immunity hypothesis (Spearman rZ0.2, p!0.001). The possibility of cross-immunity also suggests that our rather low R estimates for the autumn and winter pandemic waves do not represent the maximum transmissibility of the 1918 influenza virus in an entirely naive population (the so-called R 0 ), which may have been as high as 5.4 (Andreasen et al. in press) .Overall, this analysis of the 1918-1919 pandemic in England and Wales reveals that high-resolution spatial data at the level of cities, towns and the surrounding rural areas are key to detecting heterogeneity in influenza transmissibility and death rates. Influenza transmissibility results from a complex combination of pre-existing immunity patterns, population mixing and viral strain characteristics, while mortality is also affected by health care and sociodemographic conditions. Our results suggest that population size and urbanization played a role in the geographical patterns of the 1918-1919 pandemic in England and Wales. Whether these patterns can be generalized to contemporary seasonal influenza epidemics and future pandemics is an interesting topic for future research.  		1						
26431675	Buried treasure: evolutionary perspectives on microbial iron piracy	http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4639441?pdf=render	Host-pathogen interactions provide valuable systems for the study of evolutionary genetics and natural selection. The sequestration of essential iron has emerged as a critical innate defense system termed nutritional immunity, leading pathogens to evolve mechanisms of `iron piracy' to scavenge this metal from host proteins. This battle for iron carries numerous consequences not only for host-pathogen evolution, but also microbial community interactions. Here we highlight recent and potential future areas of investigation on the evolutionary implications of microbial iron piracy in relation to molecular arms races, host range, competition, and virulence. Applying evolutionary genetic approaches to the study of microbial iron acquisition could also provide new inroads for understanding and combating infectious disease.		1							
23480512	Polyether ionophores: broad-spectrum and promising biologically active molecules for the control of drug-resistant bacteria and parasites	http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4896753?pdf=render	BACKGROUND: As multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens continue to emerge, there is a substantial amount of pressure to identify new drug candidates. Carboxyl polyethers, also referred to as polyether antibiotics, are a unique class of compounds with outstanding potency against a variety of critical infectious disease targets including protozoa, bacteria and viruses. The characteristics of these molecules that are of key interest are their selectivity and high potency against several MDR etiological agents. OBJECTIVE: Although many studies have been published about carboxyl polyether antibiotics, there are no recent reviews of this class of drugs. The purpose of this review is to provide the reader with an overview of the spectrum of activity of polyether antibiotics, their mechanism of action, toxicity and potential as drug candidates to combat drug-resistant infectious diseases. CONCLUSION: Polyether ionophores show a high degree of promise for the potential control of drug-resistant bacterial and parasitic infections. Despite the long history of use of this class of drugs, very limited medicinal chemistry and drug optimization studies have been reported, thus leaving the door open to these opportunities in the future. Scifinder and PubMed were the main search engines used to locate articles relevant to the topic presented in the present review. Keywords used in our search were specific names of each of the 88 compounds presented in the review as well as more general terms such as polyethers, ionophores, carboxylic polyethers and polyether antibiotics.				1		1			
24474813	Stillbirth During Infection With Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus	https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/209/12/1870/2398165/jiu068.pdf	We conducted an epidemiologic investigation among survivors of an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Jordan. A second-trimester stillbirth occurred during the course of an acute respiratory illness that was attributed to MERS-CoV on the basis of exposure history and positive results of MERS-CoV serologic testing. This is the first occurrence of stillbirth during an infection with MERS-CoV and may have bearing upon the surveillance and management of pregnant women in settings of unexplained respiratory illness potentially due to MERS-CoV. Future prospective investigations of MERS-CoV should ascertain pregnancy status and obtain further pregnancy-related data, including biological specimens for confirmatory testing.

MERS-CoV; Middle East respiratory syndrome; novel coronavirus; EMC-CoV; Jordan; stillbirth; pregnancy; pneumonia; severe acute respiratory illness; birth outcomes.New cases and clusters of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections continue to occur sporadically in the Middle East, Arabian Peninsula, and Europe [1] .MERS-CoV is a novel coronavirus known to cause acute respiratory illness typically associated with fever, which can progress rapidly to respiratory failure and, in some patients, renal failure. There has been no information yet published regarding the impact of MERS-CoV infections on pregnancy outcomes.  METHODS  In May 2013, epidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) joined the Jordan Ministry of Health and regional partners to conduct a retrospective investigation of an April 2012 outbreak of respiratory illness, using newly developed serologic tests for detection of MERS-CoV antibodies. After the discovery of MERS-CoV, retrospective diagnoses of MERS-CoV infection were assigned to 2 individuals who died during this outbreak, based on findings of real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO).Serum specimens were collected and epidemiologic data were obtained from potentially exposed groups, including outbreak survivors and household contacts, through medical chart reviews and interviews. Household members were considered eligible for enrollment if they reported usually sleeping under the same roof as an outbreak member during the outbreak period, which lasted from February through April 2012. The initial outbreak case definition included "any case admitted [to the hospital] or their close contacts, who complained of fever and dry cough with radiological evidence of pneumonia during the period from 15 March to 30 April," which identified 13 individuals, including the 2 fatal cases [2] .Interviews focused on a range of topics, including the history of illness, detailed contact history (with surviving outbreak group members, the household members of outbreak group members, visiting travelers, and animals), travel history, and occupation.   RESULTS  During the course of the MERS-CoV outbreak investigation in Zarqa, Jordan, we obtained data and specimens from 11 subjects in the initial outbreak group and from 26 subjects who resided in the same households as subjects in the initial outbreak group during the outbreak period. One household was lost to follow-up, and 1 did not consent for participation. Six of these 37 subjects (16%) were women aged 18-45 years. Three (50%) reported being pregnant during the outbreak period. Two of the pregnancies reportedly resulted in miscarriage, but both mothers tested negative for MERS-CoV antibody.The third pregnant woman, aged 39 years, had a stillbirth at approximately 5 months of gestation, and her laboratory results were positive for MERS-CoV antibody by EIA (titer, 1:1600), IFA, and MNt (titer, 80). During the outbreak period, her acute respiratory symptoms (fever, rhinorrhea, fatigue, headache, and cough) occurred concurrently with vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain on the seventh day of illness, and she spontaneously delivered a stillborn infant.The pregnant subject's onset of respiratory symptoms occurred 7 days following the onset of her husband's symptomatic acute respiratory illness; he also tested positive for MERS-CoV antibodies by all 3 serologic tests (EIA titer, 1:400; IFA, MNt titer, 40). Additionally, she had another close relative who died of a MERS-CoV infection, confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, 1 day before the date of onset of the pregnant subject's symptoms. The pregnant subject reported having unprotected exposures to both of these family members during their symptomatic MERS-CoV illnesses (Figure 1) .The pregnant subject refused medical care during her illness because of stated concerns about undergoing chest radiography and receiving medications during pregnancy. As is common in this region, fetal specimens were not retained and were not available for retrospective evaluation. Before her stillbirth, she received regular antenatal care with a physician and had no reported complications during pregnancy. Including the recent stillbirth, she had had 7 pregnancies, resulting in 6 full-term live births. The surviving 6 children tested negative for MERS-CoV antibodies.  DISCUSSION  We report a second trimester stillbirth in a pregnant subject who had a concurrent acute respiratory illness that met the WHO case definition for probable MERS-CoV infection [3] . Linked to the Jordanian outbreak of MERS-CoV infection, the illness in the pregnant subject began within 14 days following unprotected exposures to 2 individuals with MERS-CoV during their illnesses (her MERS-CoV antibody-positive husband and a real-time RT-PCR-positive relative). She was symptomatic but did not seek medical care because she wished to avoid chest radiography and medications during pregnancy.With the currently limited knowledge about MERS-CoV epidemiology and pathophysiology, it is prudent to review observed associations between pregnancy outcomes and other severe respiratory pathogens. Complications such as maternal mortality and stillbirth have been reported among pregnant women with severe respiratory infections caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [4] , influenza A virus subtype H1N1 [5, 6] , and other viruses causing pneumonia [7] . Uncomplicated pregnancies lead to physiologic changes resulting in altered pulmonary and immunologic function [8, 9] , including a 20% increase in maternal oxygen consumption, a 10%-25% decrease in functional residual capacity, and significantly increased forced vital capacity after 14-16 weeks gestation. Severe respiratory illness during pregnancy may further disrupt maternal tolerance to hypoxemia and reduce oxygen flow to the fetus. Of 12 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV in South China during 1 January-31 July 2003, spontaneous miscarriages were reported from over half (59%) of those infected during their first trimesters [10] . Premature deliveries, thought to be related to poor fetal oxygenation, were experienced among 80% of those women during their second to third trimesters and were associated with intrauterine growth restriction.Further investigations in other settings of MERS-CoV infection outbreaks may shed light on factors related to the risk of infection and adverse birth outcomes in pregnant women, including any temporal relationship between maternal infection and period of gestation, biomarkers of immune hyperactivity, decreased respiratory function, and evidence of tissue necrosis upon hospitalization, as was observed during the epidemic of SARS-CoV infection to indicate adverse prognoses [11, 12] . Further information regarding the risk of MERS-CoV-associated adverse consequences to mother and fetus during pregnancy, as well as the benefits and risks of possible therapies, is needed to better inform treatment decisions in pregnant women.Although it is unclear whether cultural sensitivities restricted the full capture of information during our interviews, this was a joint investigation with the CDC and the Jordan Ministry of Health, and the interviewers included females from the region. All interviewers demonstrated an understanding of cultural sensitivities and spoke Arabic. A limitation of our report is that confirmation from seroepidemiologic evidence is difficult with any retrospective investigation, and associations between serologic evidence and a particular outcome can appear spurious. Indeed, the fetal loss rate from nonchromosomal and nonstructural causes at 20 weeks gestation is estimated to be 0.5% (95% confidence interval, .3%-.8%) [13] in developed countries, and other biological explanations for our observations are possible. Nonetheless, no other MERS-CoV infections were confirmed in Jordan around this brief outbreak period despite hundreds of specimens being tested via active surveillance [14] . On the basis of the exclusivity of the timing of the pregnant subject's unprotected MERS-CoV exposure history, concurrent respiratory illness and stillbirth, and positive results of subsequent MERS-CoV serologic tests, we describe a possible association between MERS-CoV infection and stillbirth.We conclude that adverse maternal and birth outcomes observed during the SARS-CoV epidemic and influenza A(H1N1) pandemic are consistent with the possibility that MERS-CoV infection during pregnancy may pose serious health risks to both mother and fetus. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where the majority of MERS-CoV cases have occurred, included pregnant women in its 2013 recommendation of groups that should "postpone the performance of Umrah and Hajj [in 2013]" [15] . Neither the CDC nor the WHO has issued evaluation or management strategy recommendations specifically for MERS-CoV infection among pregnant women. As indicated by our investigation, MERS-CoV infections could potentially remain undetected among pregnant women because of barriers to receiving appropriate diagnostic care. Future prospective investigations of MERS-CoV should ascertain pregnancy status, and further pregnancy-related data should be obtained, including results of confirmatory testing of biological specimens.  				1

111266	The nature and classification of viruses of man	https://doi.org/10.1016/0163-7258(79)90014-7		INTRODUCTION  Virology began as a branch of pathology. At the end of the nineteenth century, when the microbial etiology of many infectious diseases had been established, pathologists recognized that there were a number of common infectious diseases of man and his domesticated animals for which neither a bacterium nor a protozoan could be incriminated as the causal agent. In 1898, Loeflter and Frosch demonstrated that foot-and-mouth disease could be transferred from one animal to another by material which could pass through a filter that retained the smallest bacteria. Following this discovery such diseases were tentatively ascribed to what were first called 'ultramicroscopic filterable viruses ', then 'ultrafilterable viruses', and, ultimately, just 'viruses' . The word 'virus' itself, originally meaning a disease-producing poison, was appropriated to this particular class of agents because of the currency that Jenner had given to the term in describing cowpox and smallpox viruses a hundred years earlier. Fenner and White (1976) .It is impossible to define viruses satisfactorily in a sentence or even a paragraph, bearing in mind both their intracellular states and the extracellular particles or virions. Virions consist of a genome of either DNA or RNA enclosed within a protective coat of protein molecules, some of which may be associated with carbohydrates or lipids of cellular origin. In the vegetative state and as 'provirus', viruses may be reduced to their constituent genomes, and the simplest 'viruses' may be transmitted from one host to another as naked molecules of nucleic acid, possibly associated with certain cellular components. At the other extreme, the largest animal viruses, the poxviruses and the retroviruses, are relatively complex.Viruses parasitize every kind of organism; possibly, indeed, every individual organism, prokaryote and eukaryote, is infected with one or more viruses. For our purposes we need consider only the viruses of vertebrate animals--mainly those of man, but also some viruses that infect domestic or experimental animals and are important in experimental virology, including viral chemotherapy.  THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF ANIMAL VIRUSES  The simpler viruses consist solely of nucleic acid and a few virus-specified polypeptides. More complex viruses usually also contain lipids and carbohydrates; in the great majority of viral families these chemical components are not specified by the viral genome but are derived from the cells in which the viruses multiply. In exceptional situations, cellular nucleic acids or polypeptides may be incorporated in viral particles.  NUCLEIC ACIDS  Viruses, unlike microorganisms, contain only a single species of nucleic acid, which may be DNA or RNA. In different families of viruses the nucleic acid is single-or double-stranded, a single molecule or several, and if a single molecule either linear or cyclic. As yet, no animal viral nucleic acid has been found to be methylated, or to contain novel bases of the type encountered in bacterial viruses or mammalian transfer RNA's, but some virions contain oligonucleotides rich in adenylate, of unknown function. The base composition of DNA from animal viruses covers a far wider range than that of the vertebrates, for the guanine plus cytosine (G + C) content of different viruses varies from 35 to 74 per cent, compared with 40 to 44 per cent for all chordates. Indeed, the G +C content of the DNA of viruses of one family (Herpetoviridae) ranges from 46 to 74 per cent.The molecular weights of the DNA's of different animal viruses vary from just over 1 to about 150 × 106 daltons; the range of molecular weights of viral RNA's is much less~ from just over 2 to about 15 × 106 daltons. The nucleic acid can be extracted from viral particles with detergents or phenol. The released molecules are often easily degraded, but the isolated nucleic acid of viruses belonging to certain families is infectious. In other cases, the isolated nucleic acid is not infectious even though it contains all the necessary genetic information, for its transcription depends upon a virion-associated transcriptase without which multiplication cannot proceed.The genomes of all DNA viruses consist of a single molecule of nucleic acid, but the genomes of many RNA viruses consist of several different molecules, which are probably loosely linked together in the virion. In viruses whose genome consists of single-stranded nucleic acid, the viral nucleic acid is either the 'positive' strand (in RNA viruses, equivalent to messenger RNA) or the 'negative ' (complementary) strand. Preparations of some Parvoviridae, which have genomes of single-stranded DNA, consist of particles that contain either the positive or the complementary strand.Viral preparations often contain some particles with an atypical content of nucleic acid. Host-cell DNA is found in some papovaviruses, and what appear to be cellular ribosomes in some arenaviruses. Several copies of the complete viral genome may be enclosed within a single particle (as in paramyxoviruses) or viral particles may be formed that contain no nucleic acid ('empty' particles) or that have an incomplete genome, lacking part of the nucleic acid that is needed for infectivity.Terminal redundancy occurs in the DNA of some vertebrate viruses, but most sequences are unique. The largest viral genomes contain several hundred genes, while the smallest carry only sufficient information to code for about half a dozen proteins, most of which are structural proteins of the virion.  PROTEINS  The major constituent of the virion is protein, whose primary role is to provide the viral nucleic acid with a protective coat. The protein shells of the simpler viruses consist of repeating protein subunits. Sometimes the capsid protein consists of only one sort of polypeptide; more commonly there are two or three different polypeptides in the protein shell. Often certain of these surface polypeptides have a special affinity for complementary 'receptors' present on the surface of susceptible cells. They also contain the antigenic determinants that are responsible for the production of protective antibodies by the infected animal.Viral polypeptides are quite large, with molecular weights in the range 10,000-150,000 daltons. The smaller polypeptides are often, but not always, internal; the larger ones often, but not always, external. There are no distinctive features about the amino acid composition of the structural polypeptides of the virion, except that those intimately associated with viral nucleic acid in the 'core' of some icosahedral viruses are often relatively rich in arginine.Viral envelopes usually originate from the cellular plasma membrane from which the original cellular proteins have been totally displaced by viral peplomers and a viral 'membrane protein' (see Fig. 1 ). The peplomers consist of repeating units of one or two glycoproteins, the polypeptide moiety of which is virus-specified while the carbohydrate is added by cellular transferases. In many enveloped viruses, the inside of the viral envelope is lined by a viral protein called the membrane or matrix protein.Not all structural viral proteins are primary gene products, since in viruses of several families the viral mRNA is translated into a large polypeptide that is en-zymaticaUy cleaved to yield two or more smaller virion proteins. Cleavage is often one of the terminal events in the assembly of the virion and it can occur in situ aftel" most of the proteins are already in place.Although most virion polypeptides have a structural role, some have enzymatic activity. Many viruses contain a few molecules of an internal protein that functions as a transcriptase, one of the two kinds of peplomers in the envelope of myxoviruses has neuraminidase activity, and a variety of other enzymes are found in the virions of the larger, more complex viruses.In addition to polypeptides that occur as part of the virion, a large part of the viral genome codes for polypeptides that have a functional,role during viral multiplication but are not incorporated into viral particles. Few of these 'nonstructural viral proteins' have been characterized.  LIPID AND CARBOHYDRATE  Except for the large and complex poxviruses, which constitute a special case, lipid and carbohydrate are found only in viral envelopes and are always of cellular origin. The lipids of viral envelopes are characteristic of the cell of origin, though minor differences between the viral envelope and the normal plasma membrane may be demonstrable. About 50--60 per cent of the lipid is phospholipid and most of the remainder (20-30 per cent) is cholesterol. Some of the viral carbohydrate occurs in the envelope as glycolipid characteristic of the cell of origin, but most of it is part of the glycoprotein peplomers that project from the viral envelope.  THE STRUCTURE OF ANIMAL VIRUSES  Three structural classes of viruses of vertebrates can be distinguished: isometric particles, which are usually 'naked' but in some families are enclosed within a lipoprotein envelope; long tubular nucleoprotein structures, always surrounded by a lipoprotein envelope; and in a few groups, a more complex structure. TERMINOLOGY Virion (plural, virions) is used as a synonym for 'virus particle'. The protein coat of an isometric particle, or the elongated protein tube of viruses with helical symmetry, is called the capsid (Fig. 1) The chemical units are sometimes held together by disulfide bonds to form the structural units, hence the practice of using reducing agents in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis when analyzing viral proteins to determine their constituent polypeptides. The structural units are held together to form the capsid by noncovalent bonds, which may be polar (salt and hydrogen bonds) or nonpolar (van der Waals and hydrophobic bonds). The capsids of some viruses are readily disrupted in molar calcium or sodium chloride, suggesting electrovalent bonds between the structural units; others are unaffected by salt and can only be disrupted by detergents, suggesting that they are hydrophobically bonded. The capsomers of isometric viruses are arranged with icosahedral symmetry, because the icosahedron is that polyhedron with cubic symmetry which, if constructed of identical subunits, would least distort the subunits or the bonds between them.An icosahedron (Fig. 2) has 20 equilateral triangular faces, 12 vertices, where the corners of five triangles meet, and 30 edges, where the sides of adjacent pairs of triangles meet. It shows two-fold symmetry about an axis through the center of each edge ( Fig. 2A) , three-fold symmetry when rotated around an axis through the center of each triangular face (Fig. 2B) , and five-fold symmetry about an axis through each vertex (Fig. 2C ). Each triangular face may be thought of as containing, and being defined by, three asymmetric units (i.e. units that have no regular symmetry axes themselves) so that a minimum of 60 asymmetric units are required to construct an icosahedron.The pattern seen on the surface of the virion need not reflect the way in which the structural units are bonded together, and gives no clue as to whether the structural units are constituted by single chemical units or are homo-or heteropolymers of the chemical units. However, the number of structural units in each capsomer can be guessed at from the arrangement and size of the capsomers (Fig. 2) .All animal viruses whose genome is DNA have isometric (or complex) capsids, as do those whose genome is double-stranded RNA (Reoviridae) and the viruses of two large families (Picornaviridae and Togaviridae) whose genome consists of a single molecule of single-stranded RNA.VIRUSES WITH TUBULAR NUCLEOCAPSIDS Tubular nucleocapsids are found in many families of viruses of vertebrates, but only among those whose genome consists of single-stranded RNA. None of these occurs 'naked'; the flexuous helical tubes are always inside lipoprotein envelopes (Fig.  1B) . The diameters of the nucleocapsids of several viruses have been measured, but in only a few cases is the length or the pitch of the helix known.  VIRAL ENVELOPES  Although occasionally used in a more general way to refer to the outer viral coats of some complex viruses like the poxviruses, the term 'envelope' is best restricted to the outer lipoprotein coat of viruses that mature by budding through cellular membranes. Enveloped viruses contain 20-30 per cent lipid, all of which is found in the envelope. The lipid is derived from the cellular membranes through which the virus matures by budding, but all the polypeptides of viral envelopes are virusspecified. The herpetoviruses are the only viruses of vertebrates that mature by budding through the nuclear membrane, and their envelopes contain several virusspecified glycoproteins. All other enveloped viruses bud through cytoplasmic membranes, and contain one or more different polypeptides. The Togaviridae have an isometric core to which a lipid layer is directly applied, and virus-specified glycoprotein peplomers project from this. All animal viruses with tubular nucleocapsids are enveloped, and in these the lipid layer from which glycoprotein peplomers project is probably applied to a protein shell (the membrane protein; see Fig. 1 ), which may be relatively rigid, as in rhabdoviruses, or readily distorted (as in the myxoviruses), so that in negatively stained electron micrographs the virions appear to be pleomorphic.  COMPLEX VIRIONS  Viruses that have large genomes have a correspondingly complex structure. Apart from the undetermined nature of the 'cores' of many of the isometric viruses (e.g. Herpetoviridae and Adenoviridae), the virions of the largest animal viruses (Poxviridae) have highly complex structures. The RNA viruses that have the largest (single-stranded) genomes, the Retroviridae, also have a highly complex structure with an envelope enclosing an icosahedral capsid that, in turn, surrounds a tubular nucleocapsid.  CLASSIFICATION OF VIRUSES  In 1966 the Ninth International Congress for Microbiology established the International Committee for the Nomenclature of Viruses, which published its first report 5 years later (Wildy, 1971) . In 1974 the name, but not the responsibilities, of this committee was changed to the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses, and the second report was published in 1976 (Fenner, 1976) . The classification and nomenclature used in this article follows the latter report, but is restricted to the families and genera of viruses that infect vertebrate animals.  FAMILIES, GENERA AND SPECIES  Because virologists believe that there are probably no phylogenetic relationships between viruses of different families, they have hesitated to establish any taxa higher than the family, although for convenience it is customary to group viruses as 'DNA viruses' and 'RNA viruses'. At the other end of the nomenclatural spectrum, there is hopeless confusion in the ways in which the terms 'species', 'type', 'subtype', and 'strain' are used. For example, 'types' of influenza virus exhibit no serological cross-reactivity and their nucleic acids do not hybridize; they are not classified as distinct species or genera. On the other hand, many alphaviruses and flaviviruses with distinct names, which exhibit extensive serological cross-reactivity, should perhaps be regarded as types within the same species. Serological cross-reactivity and nucleic acidhybridization tests are probably most useful for making comparisons at this 'species' level.  CRYPTOGRAMS  In the descriptions of families and genera in this article the four terms of the cryptograms of Gibbs et al. (1966) , as modified in Fenner (1976) , are shown. The data refer to the infective viral particle (the virion). The first term of the cryptogram describes the type of the nucleic acid (R= RNA, D = DNA)/strandedness (1, 2 = single-, double-stranded). The second term describes the molecular weight of the nucleic acid (in millions)/the percentage of nucleic acid in the virion. Where the genome of infective particles consists of separate pieces occurring together in a single virion the symbol 'X' indicates this fact and the figure gives the total molecular weight of the genome. The third term describes the outline of the virion/outline of nucleocapsid [S = essentially spherical; E = elongated with parallel sides, ends not rounded; additional letter 'e'= enveloped; U = elongated with parallel sides, end(s) rounded; X = complex]. The fourth term, which has three components, describes the kinds of host infected (V=vertebrate; I=invertebrate)/mode(s) of transmission (C= congenital; I = ingestion; O = contact; R = inhalation; Ve = invertebrate vector)/the kinds of vector (D/= diptera; Ac = tick or mite; Si = flea). The third term is omitted if no vector is known. An asterisk indicates that a particular property is not known.The cryptograms constitute a useful shorthand description of theproperties of viral families, as can be seen from Table 2. CLASSIFICATION BASED ON PHYSICOCHEMICAL CRITERIA The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has agreed that classification should be based on physicochemical criteria, and Bot upon such properties as host range or symptomatology. Tables 3 and 9 summarize data on the morphology and chemistry of the viruses of vertebrates, and Fig. 3 illustrates their size and structure. The structure of the brick-shaped virion is complex, consisting of a biconcave DNAcontaining core surrounded by several membranes of viral origin. There is a poxvirus group antigen which is probably an internal component of the virion, and can be demonstrated by complement fixation or gel diffusion tests. Several enzymes, including a transcriptase, are found within mature virions. Multiplication occurs in the cytoplasm and the virions mature in cytoplasmic foci. Occasionally, the virion may be released within a loose membrane derived from the cytoplasmic membrane. This is not essential for infectivity, and must be distinguished from the envelope of viruses that mature by budding through cellular membranes. tSome of these families (Poxviridae, Iridoviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae and Picornaviridae) include genera or members that multiply only in invertebrates; others (Reoviridae and Rhabdoviridae) contain genera that multiply only in plants. Where the third (host) term includes the letter 'I' (Iridoviridae, Reoviridae, Bunyaviridae, Rhabdoviridae and Togaviridae) at least some of the viruses that infect vertebrates also multiply in vertebrates (i.e. they are arboviruses). The family is divided into several genera (Table 4) , arm several poxviruses have still to be classified. The properties outlined for the family apply to all the genera, except that the virions of members of genera Parapoxvirus and Capripoxvirus (see Table 4 ), and swinepox virus, are narrower than those of other poxviruses, and virions of orf have a distinctive surface structure. Species within each genus show a high degree of serological cross-reactivity by neutralization as well as complement fixation tests. Genetic recombination occurs within, but not between, genera; nongenetic reactivation (complementation) occurs between most poxviruses of vertebrates.Poxviruses cause diseases in man, domestic and wild mammals, and birds. These are sometimes associated with single or multiple benign tumors of the skin, hut are more usually generalized infections, often with a widespread vesiculo-pustular rash. Several poxviruses are transmitted in nature by anthropods acting as mechanical vectors. The herpesviruses (herpes = creeping) are readily recognized by their morphology. Their icosahedral capsid is assembled in the nucleus and acquires an envelope as the virus matures by budding through the nuclear membrane.Electron microscopic examination by negative staining of many previously unclassified viruses showed that several of them had large icosahedral capsids with 162 capsomers enclosed within lipoprotein envelopes, similar to the type species, herpes simplex virus. When examined further, such were found to be DNA viruses that multiplied in the nucleus, and have now been included in the family Herpetoviridae. Table 5 shows some of the viruses now regarded as members of this family. There is a group-specific antigen(s) associated with the nucleocapsids and demonstrable by immunodiffusion, and several type-specific antigens associated with the nucleocapsid and envelope. Some type-specific antigens cross-react (e.g. herpes simplex viruses type 1 and type 2 and B virus). Different herpesviruses cause a wide variety of types of infectious diseases, some localized and some generalized, often with a vesicular rash. A feature of many herpesvirus infections is prolonged latency associated with one or more episodes of recurrent clinical disease. The adenoviruses (adeno =gland) are non-enveloped icosahedral DNA viruses which multiply in the nuclei of infected cells, where they may produce a crystalline array of particles. Many serological types have been isolated from human sources.These have an antigen that is shared by all members of the genus Mastadenovirus, but differs from the corresponding antigen of Aviadenovirus. Allocation to the family is made primarily on the basis of the characteristic size and symmetry of the virion as seen in electron micrographs (icosahedron with 252 capsomers). Most adenoviruses are associated with respiratory infection and many such infections are characterized by prolonged latency. Some multiply in the intestinal tract and are recovered in feces. Many adenoviruses, from both mammalian and avian sources, produce malignant tumors when inoculated into new-born hamsters.In the laboratory, stable hybrids have been produced between certain adenoviruses and the Polyomavirus, SV40.Family: Papovaviridae [/9/2: 3-5/7-13: S/S: V/O, Ve/Ac, Si]The family Papovaviridae (sigla: Pa = papilloma; po = polyoma; va = vacuolating agent, SV40) encompasses two genera, Polyomavirus (poly = many; oma= tumor) and Papillomavirus (papilla = nipple; oma = tumor), which differ substantially in size and nucleic acid content of the virion (Table 7) but share many other properties. An important property of many papovaviruses is their capacity to produce tumors. In nature, the papillomaviruses produce single benign tumors (which may undergo malignant change) and are highly host specific; several of the polyomaviruses may cause primary malignant tumors within a short period of their inoculation into new-born rodents. Parvoviruses (parvo = small) are unique among the DNA viruses of vertebrates in that their genome is a single molecule of .single-stranded DNA. Two genera are recognized: several viruses of rodents which are 'normal' infectious viruses (Parvovirus) , and the adeno-associated viruses, which are able to replicate only in cells concurrently infected with an adenovirus. In the adeno-associated viruses the single strands of DNA found in a population of virions are complementary and anneal after extraction to form a double strand. The family Reoviridae (sigla: respiratory enteric orphan) contains three genera that infect vertebrates, Reovirus, Orbivirus and Rotavirus, which show minor differences in morphology and the size of their genome, but all are non-enveloped isometric viruses whose genome consists of ten pieces of double-stranded RNA (Table 10) .Viruses of the genus Reovirus are widespread among many kinds of vertebrates, usually producing non-symptomatic infections. The orbiviruses, several of which cause disease in man (Colorado tick fever) or domestic animals (bluetongue), are transmitted by arthropods. The rotaviruses cause diarrheal diseases of man and calves.Family: Retroviridae [R/l: 7-10/2: Se/*: V/C, I,O, R]The outstanding characteristic of the family Retroviridae is that all members contain an RNA-directed DNA polymerase ('reverse transcriptase'). The genome is single-stranded RNA, with a molecular weight of 7-10 million, associated with a helical nucleocapsid, which is enclosed within a capsid with cubic symmetry. This is, in turn, enclosed within a lipoprotein envelope about 100 nm in .diameter, containing peplomers which confer type specificity. They mature by budding from the plasma membrane.Although all members of the family share important characteristics that are not found in any other viruses (e.g. reverse transcriptase, structure) their classification Fenner et al., 1974) Subfamily: Oncovirinae Type C oncovirus group: lenkosis-leukemia-sarcoma viruses Includes the well studied murine leukemia and avian leukosis viruses (C-type particles). Some strains produce sarcomas, some leukemia, others fail to transform cells or to induce neoplasia. Carried in the senome of normal cells as a DNA copy of viral senome. Rodent strains show serological crossreactivity, but also have species-and type-specific antigens. tCharacteristics: Virion contains a virus-specified RNA-directed DNA polymerase and other enzymes. Genome is a linear molecule of single-stranded RNA, molecular weight 7-10 million, probably associated with tubular nucleocapsid. Structure of virion is complex, the nucleocapsid being enclosed within a capsid of cubic symmetry, which is enclosed in an envelope that carries type.specific antigens. Virion also contains species-specific (e.g. feline or murine) and interspecies-specific (e.g. avian or rodent) antigens.  remains a problem, possibly because of the very intensive studies that have been made of one subfamily (Oncovirinae) which is oncogenic. Currently they have been subdivided into three subfamilies (Table 11), the largest (Oncovirinae) being divided into two genera, one of which includes the 'C-type particle' viruses, some of which cause leukemia-sarcoma, and the other the mammary tumor virus, which has a distinctive morphology and maturation ('B-type particles') and shows no serological cross-reactivity with the C-type murine viruses. Subfamily Lentivirinae includes a group of serologically related viruses that cause slowly progressive diseases in sheep.  They have all the physicochemical properties of retroviruses. Although they do not cause neoplastic disease, they will transform cells that are non-permissive for viral growth. The viruses of subfamily Spumavirinae (foamy agents) include a number of viruses of monkeys, cats, and cattle, that have no known pathogenic potential but have been frequently isolated from tumors (as 'passenger viruses') or healthy animals. They have a different morphology from other retroviruses and produce an intranuclear antigen as well as cytoplasmic antigens in infected cells, but they contain a reverse transcriptase and, like other retroviruses, are much more resistant to UV irradiation than other RNA viruses. The family Coronaviridae (corona = crown) comprises a single genus, Coronavirus, which consists of several enveloped RNA viruses with a tubular nucleocapsid 9 nm in diameter. The genome consists of single-stranded RNA of molecular weight 9 million. tCharacteristics: genome consists of single-stranded RHA, molecular weight 9 x l0 s daltons; tubular nucleocapsid 9 nm in diameter; lipoprotein envelope 80-120 nm in diameter with large pedunculated pepiomers; multiply in cytoplasm and mature by budding into cytoplasmic vacuoles.The envelope carries characteristic pedunculated projections. Human strains cause common colds; in other animals coronaviruses infect the respiratory or alimentary tract, or may cause systemic disease.Family; Paramyxoviridae [R/l: 5--8/1:The paramyxoviruses (para=alongside; myxo=mucus) are enveloped viruses whose RNA occurs as a single linear molecule with a molecular weight of about 7 million (Table 13 ). The tubular nucleocapsid has a diameter of 18 nm and is about 1.0/~m long. It is enclosed within a pleomorphic lipoprotein envelope 150 nm or more in diameter; long filamentous forms with the same diameter also occur. tCharacteristics: single linear molecule of single-stranded RNA, 7×losdaltons, within tubular nucleocapsid 18nm in diameter; pleomorphic fipoprotein envelope 100-300 nm in diameter; virion contains a transcriptase; multiply in cytoplasm; mature by budding from cytoplasmic or intracytoplasmic membranes. Members of Paramyxovirus contain virus-specific hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, of Morbillivirus, only a hemagglutinin, of Pneumovirus neither.There are three genera: Paramyxovirus, whose envelopes contain virus-specific hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens; MorbiUivirus, comprising the related viruses that cause measles, distemper and rinderpest, and Pneumovirus, which includes human respiratory syncytial virus and pneumon ~ virus of mice. Virions of genus Morbillivirus contain a hemagglutinin but not a neuraminidase; those of Pneumovirus have neither.Some paramyxoviruses cause localized infections of the respiratory tract and several produce severe generalized diseases; among the latter some are characteristically associated with skin rashes.Family: Bunyaviridae [R/l: ~6-~7/*: Se/E: 1, V/C, Ve/Ac, Di] This family, in which only one genus, Bunyavirus, has been named so far, comprises of about 100 serologically-related arthropod-borne viruses that can be allocated to some 10 groups. Most are mosquito-transmitted, and some of these show transovarial transmission in mosquitoes; some are transmitted by ticks. *Characteristics: genome consists of single-stranded RNA, occurring as several pieces, molecular weight 6-7 million, tubular nucleocapsid 12-15 nm in diameter, within lipoprotein envelope 90-100 nm in diameter. All multiply in and are transmitted by arthropods.Morphologically, those that have been studied have enveloped roughly spherical virions 90-100 nm in diameter with a tubular nucleocapsid. Several other arboviruses serologically unrelated to those of the Bunyavirus genus have a similar morphology (Table 14) . Their genome consists of single-stranded RNA probably occurring in several pieces, with a total molecular weight of 6-7 million.Family: Orthomyxoviridae [R/l: 24/1: Se/E: V/R] In early classifications, some members of two very different families, now distinguished from each other as orthomyxoviridae (ortho = correct; myxo = mucus) and Paramyxoviridae, were grouped together as Myxovirus. The common properties were an RNA genome, a tubular nucleocapsid, and a pleomorphic lipoprotein envelope that carried the properties of hemagglutination and enzymatic elution. The term 'myxovirus' is now only used as a vernacular expression to encompass the viruses that have these properties (viz. influenza, mumps, Newcastle disease, and parainfluenza viruses); it has no taxonomic status.The family orthomyxoviridae comprises two genera; one, called Inltuenzavirus, includes two species, A and B, with their many subtypes and strains. The other genus, represented by influenza type C, has not yet been named. All members of the family have a fragmented genome consisting of eight pieces of single-stranded RNA, which accounts for the frequent genetic reassortment found in mixed infections. The virion contains two virus,specific enzymes; a surface neuraminidase and an internal transcriptase. tCharacteristics: genome consists of eight separate pieces of single-stranded RNA, total molecular weight 4 million; tubular nucleocapsid 6-9 nm diameter is type-specific antigen; lipoprotein envelope 80-120nm in diameter contains strain-specific hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens; virion contains a transcriptase; multiply in nucleus and cytoplasm; mature by budding from the plasma membrane. ~Includes fowl plague virus.Influenzavirus A has been recovered from a number of different species of animals (birds, horses, and swine) as well as man; Influenzavirus B and influenza type C are specifically human pathogens. They are an important cause of respiratory disease in man and other animals, and some of the avian influenza viruses may cause severe generalized infections in birds. The family arenaviridae (arena = sand), which contains one genus, Arenavirus, was first defined by the electron microscopic appearance of the virions in thin sections, and serological cross-reactivity. The pleomorphic enveloped virions are 85-120 nm in diameter (sometimes larger), and have closely spaced peplomers. The structure of the nucleocapsid is unknown, but in thin sections the interior of the particle is seen to contain a variable number of electron-dense granules 20-30 nm in diameter, hence the name.All members of the genus are associated with chronic inapparent infections of rodents; some cause acute generalized diseases in. other hosts (e.g. Lassa fever virus in man). . tCharacteristics: single-stranded RNA probably in several pieces, total molecular weight 3.2-5.6 million; lipoprotein envelope 85-300nm in diameter; multiply in cytoplasm; mature by budding from plasma membrane. All members share a group-specific antigen. Envelope encloses granules 20-30 nm in diameter; some of these are cellular ribosomes. There is a virion-associated transcriptase.Family: Rhabdoviridae JR/l: 3.5-4.6/2-3: Ue/E: I, V, C, O, Ve]The rhabdoviruses (rhabdo = rod) are enveloped RNA viruses with single-stranded RNA with a molecular weight of about 4 million. The RNA is associated with a very regular double-helical nucleocapsid 5 nm in diameter, enclosed within a bullet-shaped shell that measures about 175 x 75 nm (Table 17) .The family contains two named genera, Vesiculovirus and Lyssavirus, that infect vertebrates and some viruses ~ot yet allocated to a genus; some insect and plant viruses may also belong to this family.Family: Togaviridae JR/l: 3.5-4/5-8: Se/S: I, V/C, I, O, R, Ve/Ac, Di] During the last quarter century intensive world-wide efforts have been made to recover viruses which would multiply in both arthropods and vertebrates, and some 200 different agents with these biological properties are now known. They have been called 'arthropod-borne viruses', a name which was shortened to 'arborviruses' and then (in order to avoid the connotation of 'tree') to 'arboviruses'. The arboviruses have been defined, on epidemiological grounds (mode of transmission), as a group comparable to the 'respiratory viruses'. Arboviruses are viruses which, in nature, can infect arthropods that ingest infected vertebrate blood, can multiply in the arthropod tissues, and can then be transmitted by bite to susceptible vertebrates.For many years arboviruses have been recovered from vertebrate tissues and suspensions of arthropods by the intracerebral inoculation of mice, and advantage has been taken of certain chemical and physical properties found to be commonly associated with them to avoid confusion with murine picornaviruses. The property generally tested was sensitivity to lipid solvents. Many arboviruses have lipoprotein envelopes and their infectivity is destroyed by these reagents. There was thus a tendency to equate sensitivity to lipid solvents with 'arbovirus'. During the last decade it has been recognized that the arbovirus group is quite heterogeneous in its physicochemical properties. Some members are not enveloped (Orbivirus, Nodamura virus), and those sensitive to lipid solvents belong to at least three families (Togaviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Bunyaviridae).This preamble has been necessary because in the past the term 'arboviruses' has been regarded as applying particularly to viruses with the physicochemical properties of the group A and group B arboviruses. These viruses now form two genera (Alphavirus and Flavivirus) of the family Togaviridae (toga = cloak). The family also contains two other genera, Rubivirus and Pestivirus for which no arthropod vectors are known (Table 18) .Genus: Alphavirus [R/l: 4/5-6: SelS: I, V, VelDi]. The alphaviruses (alpha = Greek letter A), formerly known as the group A arboviruses, have the familial characteristics (Table 18 ) and show serological cross-reactivity by the hemagglutinin-inhibition test. The arthropod vectors are mosquitoes, but some alphaviruses may be transmitted congenitally by vertebrates. In nature, they usually cause inapparent infections of birdS, reptiles, or mammals, but some can cause generalized infections associated with encephalitis in man and in other mammals.Genus: Flavivirus [R/l: 4/8: SelS: I, V, C, O, VelAc, D/]. This genus (flaviyellow) comprises the group B arboviruses. All members show serological crossreactivity. The arthropod vectors may be ticks or mosquitoes, and some of them may be transmitted by the ingestion of contaminated milk. They differ from the alphaviruses in that budding usually occurs into cytoplasmic vacuoles rather than from the plasma membrane. Most cause inapparent infections in mammals and less commonly in birds, but generalized infections of man may occur with visceral symptomatology (e.g. yellow fever), rashes (e.g. dengue), or encephalitis (e.g. Japanese encephalitis).Genus: Rubivirus [R/I: 3.5/*: Se/S: V/C, R] contains oniy one species, rubella virus, causing a minor generalized exanthematous disease in man, which may be associated with congenital defects in the new-born when pregnant women are infected during the first three months of pregnancy.Genus: Pestivirus JR/l: 4/*: Se/S: V/C, I, R]. These are viruses recovered from cattle and swine, whose virions are physicochemically like togaviruses; but they are not transmitted by arthropods. Hog cholera virus may be transmitted congenitally. (pH3) and have a buoyant density (in CsC1) of 1.34-1.35 g/cm 3. They are primarily inhabitants of the intestines, and a large number of serotypes have been found in the feces of man and of various animals.The enteroviruses of man have been sulddivided into three major subgroups: poliovirus, three serotypes; echovirus (acronym: echo=enteric cytopathogenic human orphan), 34 serotypes; and coxsackievirus (Coxsackie = town in New York State), 24 serotypes of type A and six of type B. The polioviruses, which show some serological cross-reactivity, are distinguished by their capacity to paralyze humans. Coxsackieviruses were originally defined in terms of their capacity to multiply in infant mice, but subsequently some echoviruses were found to do the same. It has been recommended that all future enteroviruses that are discovered should be numbered sequentially from 68, irrespective to subgroups. Some workers distinguish a separate genus Cardiovirus (see Table 19 ) on the basis of the resemblance of several species which differ in other respects from Enterovirus.Genus: Rhinovirus [R/l: 2.3-2.8/30: S/S: V/R]. The rhinoviruses resemble the enteroviruses in several characteristics but they are acid labile (pH 3) and have a buoyant density (in CsCI) of 1.38-1.43 g/cm 3. Most have a low ceiling temperature of growth and are characteristically found in the upper respiratory tract of man and various animals.There are a large number of different serotypes of human rhinoviruses. Foot-and-mouth disease virus, of which there are several serotypes, resembles rhinoviruses in some respects, but not in others (Table 19) , and is sometimes classified as a separate genus  ( Aphthovirus ).  Most rhinoviruses cause mild localized infections of the upper respiratory tract, but foot-and-mouth disease virus causes a severe generalized disease with rash in cattle.Genus: Calicivirus [R/l: 2.8120-30: S/S: V/I, R]. This genus differs substantially from the other genera of the Picornaviridae, both in its morphology and the chemical composition of the capsid, the outstanding difference being the distinctive 'chunky' arrangement of the capsomers. The other properties of the genus are those common to the Picornaviridae, with acid stability and a buoyant density intermediate between those of Enterovirus and Rhinovirus.  UNCLASSIFIED VIRUSES  There remain a few important viruses, from the point of view of human disease, that have not yet been characterized sufficiently as physicochemical entities for classification.  Human hepatitis viruses  Experiments with human volunteers have shown that the diseases commonly known as infective hepatitis and serum hepatitis are caused by two viruses that differ serologically, in their clinical expression, and in their usual routes of transmission. Because both can be transmitted orally it is better to use noncommital names for them; 'serum hepatitis' is now termed hepatitis B; infective hepatitis, hepatitis A. Study of these viruses has been greatly inhibited by the lack of susceptible laboratory animals (chimpanzees may get clinical hepatitis; marmosets and rhesus monkeys subclinical infection, while other laboratory animals are insusceptible), and the difficulty of obtaining reproducible cytopathic changes in cultured cells. The recognition in the sera of cases of serum hepatitis of lipoprotein particles of characteristic serological specificity, 'Australia antigen', now hepatitis B antigen (HB-Ag), has led to a great expansion in studies on the incidence and pathogenesis of hepatitis B, but the actual virions have not yet been analysed.Virus particles found in the feces of patients suffering from hepatitis A have been identified as the causative agents by immunoelectron microscopy; they are small isometric virions and it has been suggested that they may belong to the family Parvoviridae.  Agents of Subacute Spongiform Encephalopathies  Four diseases of similar nature, scrapie of sheep, transmissible encephalopathy of mink, and kuru and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease in man appear to be caused by similar agents, which differ from all known viruses by being non-immunogenic. The causative agents are filtrable, highly heat-resistant, and highly resistant to ionizing radiation. It has been suggested that they may be small molecules of naked RNA, protected by their close association with cellular membranes and thus similar to the 'viroids' of some plant diseases, like potato spindle tuber disease. A definitive description of these agents is still awaited.  The Marburg Agent  In Germany, in 1967, a small outbreak of a serious new disease occurred in laboratory workers who had handled the tissues of recently imported vervet monkeys. Since then the virus has been recovered from sporadic cases of hemorrhagic fever among human patients in Africa. The causative agent grows in cultured cells and kills guinea pigs. Studies with inhibitors suggest that it contains RNA; of known viruses it most closely resembles rhabdoviruses in structure but is much larger and more pleomorphic.  	1							
28477669	The Microbiota of the Extremely Preterm Infant	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clp.2017.01.005	Abstract  Microbiota Dysbiosis Intestinal tract Skin Oral cavity Necrotizing enterocolitis Late-onset sepsisThe intestinal microbiota of the extremely preterm infant differs dramatically from that of term infants, children, and adults with decreased diversity and high numbers of g-proteobacteria and Firmicutes and low numbers of common commensal microbes. Alterations in the intestinal microbiota of the preterm infant precede the onset of necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis. Altering the intestinal microbiota with diet, antibiotics, and prebiotic and probiotic supplements may be less effective in extremely preterm infants, prompting the need for novel approaches to dysbiosis in this population.	INTRODUCTION  Colonization of the fetal skin and intestinal tract begins in utero and is influenced by maternal microbial communities (particularly those that inhabit the distal intestinal tract, the mouth, the vagina, and the skin), timing of rupture of membranes, maternal genetic factors, medications and supplements. Colonization is further influenced by mode of delivery and postpartum environmental exposures and medical procedures, infant genetic factors, medications and supplements, enteral feeding, and maturity of the infant innate and adaptive immune systems. Breakthroughs in recent decades in the analysis of complex communities of bacteria and viruses and studies in germfree and gnotobiotic animals have vastly expanded our understanding of the importance of interactions between host and microbe. The composition of the microbial community of the intestinal tract and skin impacts inflammatory pathways and is thus important in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of disease processes (Box 1).Novel mechanisms by which the microbiota influences host immunity and inflammation have recently been described. [1] [2] [3] The importance of the intestinal microbiota in extremely preterm infants is most clearly evident in considering the risks of developing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and sepsis. The roles of the skin microbiota in sepsis risk and the oral microbiota in pneumonia risk are less clear. Perhaps most compelling is the role of colonizing microbes in shaping and influencing the developing innate and adaptive immune responses in extremely preterm infants and the long-term impact of these hostmicrobe interactions. An additional layer of complexity is emerging with the realization that nutrients (eg, human milk, infant formulas and fortifiers, vitamins and minerals) are consumed by both host and bacterial cells, often with keen competition and overlapping effects. Host-microbe-nutrient interactions are likely to be particularly important in such processes as growth, brain development, immune development, and disease risk for the most preterm infants. In this article, we use the terms microbiota to refer to the composition of bacteria in a given anatomic niche and dysbiosis to mean an alteration in the microbiota associated with disease. There is evidence of significant colonization of the extremely preterm infant with yeasts, bacteriophages, and other viruses, 4 but discussion of these microbes is beyond the scope of this article.  DEVELOPMENT OF THE INFANT MICROBIOTA In Utero  The development of tools to characterize the microbiota based on identification of bacterial DNA rather than relying on cultures has expanded understanding of the initial colonization of the neonate tremendously. Table 1 summarizes the primary bacterial taxa that colonize the preterm infant. It has long been believed that the fetus grows in a sterile environment and that colonization begins at the time of rupture of the fetal membranes. More recent careful studies have shown that the amniotic fluid is not sterile, suggesting that colonization of the fetal skin and gut begins in utero. 5 The role of microbes in triggering preterm labor is perhaps the most clinically relevant observation related to this observation. Chorioamnionitis has long been recognized as a trigger of preterm labor and neonatal infection (particularly in preterm infants). The preponderance of evidence suggests a causal relationship between maternal periodontal disease and preterm labor. 6 For instance, the presence of specific bacteria (eg, Peptostreptococcus micros or Campylobacter rectus) in maternal gingival plaque was associated with increased risk of preterm delivery. 7 disease during pregnancy is associated with decreased risk of preterm labor. 8 The demonstration of the same microbes in the amniotic fluid and periodontal plaques in women delivering preterm, 9 the observation that the most common bacterium identified in amniotic fluid from women delivering preterm is Fusobacterium nucleatum (a common oral microbe in adults), 10 and the observation that dental infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis (a common bacterium in periodontal disease) causes preterm birth, low birth weight, and colonization of the placenta in mice 11 suggests actual colonization of the placenta and fetus. Detailed studies of the microbiota of the placenta have shed some light on early colonization of the fetus. The placenta has a low bacterial load and is easily contaminated during vaginal delivery. Analysis of placentas obtained at term cesarean delivery without rupture of the fetal membranes showed similarities among the microbiota of the placenta, the amniotic fluid, and meconium, suggesting in utero gut colonization with changes in the infant fecal samples in the first 3 to 4 days after birth reflecting the acquisition of microbes in colostrum. 12 Colonization of the placenta with Ureaplasma species increases the risks of preterm labor and intraventricular hemorrhage in extremely preterm infants 13 and of chorioamnionitis in moderate and late preterm infants. 14 Shortly after birth, the neonatal microbiota in the term infant is heavily influenced by mode of delivery with vaginally delivered infants colonized with organisms from the maternal vagina and infants delivered by cesarean colonized with organisms from the maternal skin and no real differences in neonatal microbial communities among the mouth, nasopharynx, skin, and meconium. 15 In preterm infants, the microbiota of the skin diverges from that of the stool and saliva by day 8 of life, and the microbiota of the saliva and stool diverge by day 15. 16 In a study of the microbiota of meconium in preterm infants, Staphylococcus was the dominant genus and Staphylococcus epidermidis the most common species. Among those infants with gestational age less than 28 weeks, S epidermidis was present in meconium of 3 of the 4 infants delivered by cesarean and 1 of the 3 delivered vaginally. 17   Fecal Microbiota  Changes in the fecal microbiota of the extremely preterm infant over the first weeks of life have been characterized. 4, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] The following patterns are consistent across multiple studies: (1) bacterial diversity is low in meconium and increases over time; (2) an early dominance of Firmicutes (predominantly staphylococci, enterococci, and in some studies streptococci) changes to a dominance of Proteobacteria (predominantly Enterobacteriaceae); (3) Clostridium and Veillonella species appear late compared with term infants, with Veillonella least common in infants born at <27 weeks; (4) diet and antibiotic exposure have a lesser impact on the fecal microbiota in extremely preterm infants than is seen in term infants (eg, the human milk oligosaccharide [HMO]-consuming organisms, bifidobacteria and Bacteroides, are uncommon even in exclusively human milk-fed preterm infants); and (5) postmenstrual age significantly influences the fecal microbiota. These observations suggest that environmental factors and maturation of the host immune response are the primary shapers of the developing gut microbiota in preterm infants. It is worth noting how strikingly the fecal microbiota of the preterm infant differs from that of the healthy term infant with the former often containing 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher levels of g-Proteobacteria and the latter commonly dominated by bifidobacteria and Bacteroides.  Gastric Microbiota  Gastric aspirates have recently been studied using bacterial DNA techniques. Analysis of 22 neonates with an average gestational age of 27.7 weeks (AE2.8) demonstrated a relative paucity of species in the stomach, with Bacteroides spp predominant in the first 4 weeks of life and Bifidobacterium colonization significantly higher in infants receiving human milk. These results differ dramatically from studies of the fecal microbiota and raise the possibility that, although rare in the feces of preterm infants, the 2 genera of bacteria capable of consuming HMOs may be present in their small bowel. 23 In this study, Helicobacter pylori and Ureaplasma were not identified; however, a different study of 12 neonates with an average gestational age of 27 weeks (AE0.5) found the predominant species in the first week of life to be Ureaplasma, with a predominance of S epidermidis in subsequent weeks. By the fourth week, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes each accounted for 50% of the total gastric organisms. 24 The reasons for this disparity are unclear, but may represent differences in technique (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in the first study and direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-amplified clones in the second), differences in population (both studies were performed in the United States, but diversity in maternal colonization with Ureaplasma may have played a role), or the relatively small numbers of infants analyzed.  Oral Microbiota  Investigations of the development of the oral microbiota in extremely preterm infants are limited. The largest study to date included 110 preterm infants with birth weight less than 1000 g with weekly oral swabs for the first 6 weeks of life, but used culture techniques rather than bacterial DNA-based approaches. At birth the oral swabs did not show significant growth of culturable bacteria, but by week one, 21 infants were colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 6 infants had other pathogenic bacteria (S aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli), 56 infants were colonized with "nonpathogenic bacteria" (S epidermidis was most common followed by Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus), and 22 infants still showed no significant growth of culturable bacteria. By 6 weeks, 60 of the infants were colonized with MRSA. It is noteworthy that MRSA sepsis cases were less common in those infants with early oral colonization with the "nonpathogenic" microbes. 25 Smaller studies of preterm infants using culture-only technology have shown colonization of the mouth in the first 10 days of life with coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, and Candida. 26 A study using bacterial DNA-based technology included 1 infant with gestational age 24 weeks; the saliva microbiota differed from the other 4 preterm infants analyzed (gestational age 30-31 weeks) in that there were Enterobacteriaceae at days 8 and 10 and Pseudomonas and Mycoplasma at days 15, 18, and 21 that were not seen in the older preterm infants. 16 We analyzed the oral microbiota of 7 preterm infants   Skin Microbiota  The skin of the extremely preterm infant changes dramatically in the first weeks of life. The stratum corneum, which functions as the epidermal barrier, is nearly absent at 23 weeks' gestation, has a few cornified layers at 26 weeks, and is not fully mature until approximately 34 weeks' gestation. 28 When infants are born preterm, the epidermis matures fairly rapidly, and even the most immature neonate has functionally and histologically mature epidermis by approximately 2 weeks postnatal age. 29 Studies of the skin microbiota of the extremely preterm infant are limited. Several studies have demonstrated that pathogens commonly colonize the skin of preterm infants (mostly staphylococci, enterococci, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadales, and Candida) and that MRSA colonization is more common in the preterm infant; however, these studies were not designed to analyze the broader skin microbiota. [30] [31] [32] The previously noted study comparing changes over time in the saliva, skin, and feces included 1 infant with gestational age 24 weeks. The skin of this infant was dominated by staphylococci during the time of testing (day 8 to day 21) and did not differ from the older preterm infants. 16 Environmental factors that influence the skin microbiota include parental skin, feeding type, environmental surfaces and caregiving equipment, health care provider skin, and antibiotic use. 33   THE MICROBIOTA AND DISEASE RISK IN EXTREMELY PRETERM INFANTS The Fecal Microbiota and Necrotizing Enterocolitis and Sepsis  The incidences of NEC and sepsis are highest in the most preterm infants, likely due to immaturity of intestinal and skin barriers and immaturity of immune responses. Cases and outbreaks of NEC have been associated with a striking variety of organisms ( Table 2 ), suggesting that there is not a single organism responsible. The evidence that the early or colonizing microbiota of the intestine influences the risk for subsequent development of NEC and/or sepsis has become quite compelling. The observation that NEC is most common in infants born at less than 28 weeks gestation and most commonly occurs at 30 to 32 weeks corrected gestational age 34 suggests that maturation of the host immune response and/or maturation of the intestinal microbiota are important in NEC pathogenesis. The Paneth cells of the small intestine produce large quantities of antimicrobial peptides that shape the intestinal microbiota. 35 It is not likely coincidental that Paneth cells increase in numbers and become immunecompetent at 29 weeks corrected gestational age. 36, 37 Lower fecal bacterial diversity and/or richness is common in extremely preterm infants and has been demonstrated in some studies of infants with NEC compared with matched controls, 22,38-40 although this is not universal. 41, 42 Studies investigating the fecal microbiota before the onset of NEC compared with matched controls are summarized in Table 3 . 40, 41, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] These studies demonstrate the following: (1) colonization patterns differ between preterm infants who subsequently develop NEC and those who do not; (2) these differences are heavily influenced by maturation, NICU location, antibiotic exposure, and perhaps feeding type; (3) it remains unclear whether NEC risk is associated with the absence of potentially protective microbes (eg, Propionibacterium, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, or Veillonella species) or the dominance of potentially pathogenic microbes (eg, Enterobacteriaceae or Clostridium species); and (4) it remains unclear whether dysbiosis is the cause of NEC or a marker of alterations in host genetics or immune development. Two observations support the hypothesis that Enterobacteriaceae are important in the pathogenesis of NEC: (1) recognition of lipopolysaccharide in the cell wall of Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae by Toll-like receptor 4 triggers a proinflammatory response and an influx of lymphocytes that in animal models is essential to the development of NEC, 55 and (2) Enterobacteriaceae have unique metabolic pathways by which they both trigger inflammation and use the products of the host inflammatory response as an energy source allowing them to outcompete other gut microbes. 56 Many of the organisms responsible for late-onset sepsis (LOS), including staphylococci, in extremely preterm infants originate in the intestinal tract. 57 Several studies have demonstrated organisms in the feces before or concurrent with the onset of LOS caused by the identical organism in extremely preterm infants. [58] [59] [60] Decreased bacterial diversity and a predominance of staphylococci in early fecal specimens were associated with later sepsis in one small study of infants with gestational age 24 to 27 weeks. 61 The Skin Microbiota and SepsisEfforts to decrease LOS with emphasis on the skin microbiota (eg, hand washing, protocols for line placement and care, early removal of central lines) have been partially successful, suggesting that a portion of these infections originate in the skin. Studies correlating skin colonization with LOS have relied on culture-based approaches and therefore likely give a limited view of the microbiota. 62 The Oral and Gastric Microbiota and PneumoniaIn critically ill adults and children, attention to oral care has been shown to decrease the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, suggesting that aspirated oral microbes Tracheal pepsin has been proposed as a marker of aspiration of gastric contents and appears to be common in preterm infants. 63 Bacterial DNA techniques have demonstrated an association between the gastric microbiota and chronic lung disease, with Ureaplasma the most common genus. 64 The Tracheal Microbiota and Chronic Lung DiseaseThe lower airway is not sterile in the preterm infant. Tracheal aspirates from very preterm intubated infants have predominantly been studied with culture-based techniques. 65 A study of 25 preterm infants using bacterial DNA techniques demonstrated a predominance of Actinobacteria, which decreased over time in infants who subsequently developed chronic lung disease (gestational age 26.2 AE 1.9 weeks) but remained stable over time in the infants who did not (gestational age 28.9 AE 1.4 weeks). In the former group, Staphylococcus increased over time and bacterial diversity was lower. 66 A study of 10 infants with birth weight 500 to 1250 g who were intubated for more than 21 days demonstrated a predominance of Staphylococcus, Ureaplasma, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, and Escherichia. 67 In both culture-based and DNA-based studies there appear to be differences in the tracheal microbiota between infants who subsequently develop chronic lung disease and those who do not; however, distinguishing between colonization of the airway and infection remains challenging.  Environmental Microbes and Disease Risk  The impact of the NICU environment on colonization, immune responses, and risk for nosocomial infection in the extremely preterm infant has not been fully characterized. The composition of the surface and airborne microbiota is influenced by building design and utilization with hospital surfaces more likely to contain human pathogens than other office settings. 68 Two studies of NICU surfaces using bacterial DNA techniques, found significant diversity between NICUs and demonstrated common neonatal pathogens (eg, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Escherichia, Enterococcus, Acinetobacter, and Candida albicans) on NICU surfaces. 69, 70 Intensive cleaning has been shown to significantly reduce the total microbial load and reshape the diversity toward nonpathogenic organisms. Interestingly, many of the common NICU enteric genera (Enterococcus, Klebsiella, Escherichia, and Pseudomonas) were not significantly altered by an intensive cleaning regimen, and routine cleaning of environmental surfaces with antibacterial wipes may be just as effective to reduce potentially pathogenic bacteria. 70 Examples of environmental studies of NICU infectious outbreaks are abundant. In one NICU, during high-risk respiratory syncytial virus season, 4% of clothing swabs, and 9% of environmental "high-touch" surface swabs (beds, side tables, countertops, chairs, tables, and computers) tested positive for the virus by PCR. 71 Using DNA sequencing, a sink drain was shown to be the source of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa outbreak and replacing the sink and plumbing appeared to eradicate the outbreak. 72 A Burkholderia cepacia outbreak, in which 12 neonates developed clinical and/or laboratory evidence of sepsis was traced to contaminated intravenous solution and water for humidification of ventilator circuits. 73 A cluster of Bacillus cereus colitis cases, 74 an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase E coli outbreak, 75 and case reports of Group B Streptococcus septicemia in preterm infants 76 have all been attributed to contaminated breast milk. Cronobacter species have been identified as a contaminant of powdered milk formulas, with sporadic outbreaks linked to NEC, bacteremia, and meningitis. 77, 78 Bacteria also can colonize unlikely sources. B cepacia and Enterobacter cloacae have the ability to hydrolyze, render inactive, and proliferate in parabens, which are esters of para-hydroxybenzoic acid that are usually antimicrobial and used as preservatives in ultrasound gel (implicated in a B cepacia outbreak in a NICU). 79, 80 Serratia marcescens outbreaks in NICUs have been linked to stored water and incubator surfaces, 81 the exit port of a high-frequency oscillatory ventilator, 82 contaminated parenteral nutrition, 83 soap dispensers, 84 and baby shampoo. 85   MANIPULATING THE MICROBIOTA OF THE EXTREMELY PRETERM INFANT Diet  Breast-fed term infants generally become colonized in the first weeks after birth with gut microbes that are able to consume HMOs and other human milk glycans (bifidobacteria and Bacteroides), whereas formula-fed infants tend to become colonized with a more diverse mixture of microbes. As noted previously, in the extremely preterm infant, the provision of human milk does not have a marked influence on the fecal microbiota with "human milk-consuming" microbes consistently either absent or present in low abundance across multiple studies. In a small study, neither the addition of a mixture rich in HMOs to preterm infant formula nor the "all-human diet" (human milk fortified with a fortifier made from donor human milk) led to a significant change in the fecal microbiota. 86 Nevertheless, careful analysis of the composition of HMOs in ingested milk and undigested HMOs in feces in preterm infants showed that different HMO structures are differentially consumed in the preterm gut with increased fucosylated HMOs in milk associated with a decrease in Proteobacteria in the infant feces. 87  Probiotics  To date, a total of 41 randomized placebo-controlled trials of probiotics in preterm infants have been published in English; 37 of these trials included NEC, sepsis, and/or death as an outcome. In spite of differences in probiotic choice and dose administered, several meta-analyses have reached the same conclusion: probiotics decrease the risk of NEC, death, and sepsis in preterm infants and decrease the time to full enteral feeding in preterm infants receiving human milk. [88] [89] [90] In addition, there have been 11 cohort studies published in English comparing periods of no probiotic to periods of universal probiotic administration in preterm infants with a meta-analysis of these studies demonstrating a decrease in NEC and mortality with probiotic administration. 91 Table 4 summarizes the nonweighted results of the randomized controlled trials and the cohort studies. [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] In spite of this astounding level of evidence and the relative lack of risk, routine probiotic administration is not recommended in the United States due to concerns from the Food and Drug Administration and other experts regarding the lack of commercial probiotic products that meet high standards of purity and viability. Whether these recommendations are justifiable given the incidence, cost, and severity of NEC and the relative paucity of evidence of harm associated with probiotic administration is hotly debated. In addition, it has been widely reported that although probiotic products appear to be beneficial for preterm infants with birth weight greater than 1000 g, data supporting a benefit for extremely low birth weight infants are lacking. 21 Tables 5 and 6 summarize the data available from the randomized controlled trials and the cohort studies for the smallest preterm infants, including unweighted totals and percentages. [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] Although the level of support is not as compelling as that for larger preterm infants, these data suggest potential benefit and certainly no convincing evidence of harm for this population.  Antibiotics  Five clinical trials of oral administration of antibiotics that are unlikely to be absorbed systemically (gentamicin, kanamycin, or vancomycin) demonstrated a decrease in the incidence of NEC. 115 Although this approach has been adopted in some NICUs, the concerns of emergence of resistant organisms have precluded widespread adoption. A recent report of the emergence of colistin-resistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae following oral administration to preterm infants for NEC prophylaxis underscores the validity of these concerns. 116  Buccal Colostrum  Administration of colostrum directly into the buccal pouch has been proposed as oral hygiene to decrease the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia in intubated neonates. To date, studies have shown an impact on the oropharyngeal lymphatic tissues 117 and the oral microbiota, 27 a decrease in clinical sepsis, 117 but no clear decrease in pneumonia. A multicenter trial of this intervention is under way. 118  Cleaning Agents  Early studies of the value of environmental disinfection as a strategy to decrease hospital-acquired infections were limited and disappointing. 119 More recent studies suggest that novel interventions may be helpful in interrupting and preventing infectious hospital outbreaks. 120 Demonstrations that chlorhexidine bathing is associated with decreased risk of hospital-acquired infections compared with soap and water 121 have prompted widespread adoption of this practice for children and adults. For similar reasons, frequent use of hand-sanitizing gels and foams among health care providers has become widespread. Unfortunately, we have no data about the long-term impact of these interventions on the skin microbiota or systemic absorption of these products for either the health care provider or the patient (particularly for highly vulnerable patients like the extremely preterm infant).  Emollients  Topical application of ointments, oils, or other emollients to the skin of the preterm infant has not demonstrated any significant decrease in rates of invasive infection or death. 122 Studies of the impact of this approach on the skin microbiota are limited to culture studies, with 1 study showing no differences 123 and 2 studies showing nonspecific changes. 30, 124 Functionalized SurfacesCreation of novel surfaces that are resistant to colonization with potentially pathogenic microbes is a promising approach. Although this field is still in its infancy, the most promising result may be decreased surface contamination with viruses. 125 Isolettes with pathogen-resistant surfaces and medical devices coated with commensal or probiotic organisms may someday be commonplace.  SUMMARY  The study of microbes that colonize extremely preterm infants and the devices and surfaces with which they come in contact holds great promise for decreasing the high morbidity and mortality in this evolutionarily new population. Understanding and preventing dysbiosis may be crucial to the prevention of common and devastating processes such as NEC, chronic lung disease, and sepsis, but also may impact growth, development, immune function, and risk for a broad variety of chronic diseases and conditions.  Best Practices  What is the current practice?The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends mother's own milk for preterm infants and pasteurized donor human milk if the mother is unable to provide sufficient milk In many countries, prophylactic probiotic supplements are routine for preterm infantsWhat changes in current practice are likely to improve outcomes?Increased utilization of probiotics that reach high standards of purity and viability will decrease NEC in infants with birth weight greater than 1000 g (Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Oxford, 1a)Increased utilization of probiotics may decrease NEC and sepsis in smaller preterm infants (Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Oxford, 1b) and may decrease risk of childhood and adult onset diseases (Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Oxford, 5)Development of targeted approaches to decrease dysbiosis of the mouth, stomach, intestines, skin, and trachea may decrease diseases of extremely preterm infants associated with acute or chronic inflammation (Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Oxford, 5)   			1	1				
23490399	Identification of respiratory viruses with a novel point-of-care multianalyte antigen detection test in children with acute respiratory tract infection	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2013.02.011	Abstract Background Rapid etiological diagnosis of a respiratory virus infection may have impact on antiviral and antibiotic therapy, patient cohorting, and prediction of the clinical course. Most point-of-care tests for detection of respiratory viruses have limitations in diagnostic performance and clinical usability. A novel, multianalyte point-of-care antigen detection test system (mariPOC®; ArcDia International Oy Ltd., Turku, Finland) detects eight respiratory viruses (influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza type 1, 2, and 3 viruses) from a single nasopharyngeal swab specimen by a fully automated, random-access immunoassay method. Objectives To evaluate mariPOC® point-of-care test system in comparison with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in a pediatric emergency department setting. Study design Prospectively collected samples from 158 children (mean age, 1.8 years) with respiratory symptoms and/or fever were analyzed both by mariPOC® and by multiplex RT-PCR. Results The sensitivities and specificities (95% confidence intervals) of the mariPOC® test were for influenza A (n =7), 71% (38–100) and 100%; influenza B (n =22), 86% (72–100) and 98% (95–100); RSV (n =35), 89% (78–99) and 100%; adenovirus (n =12), 25% (1–50) and 97% (95–99); and for human metapneumovirus (n =8), 50% (15–85) and 100%, respectively. Parainfluenzaviruses were detected only in five patients. Conclusions This novel point-of-care test system is a rapid, practical, and specific method for simultaneous detection of eight respiratory viruses. Compared with RT-PCR, its sensitivity is moderately high for detection of RSV and influenza viruses, and low for adenovirus.	Background  Children under 7 years of age have every year on average from 4 to 6 respiratory tract infections. 1,2 Acute respiratory tract infections are the most common cause for admitting children to hospital in developed countries. 3 Children's respiratory tract infections are mainly of viral etiology. Common respiratory viruses include influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1, 2, and 3, and rhinovirus. 1, 4 The clinical importance of more newly discovered human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronaviruses OC43/HKU1 and 229E/NL63, and human bocavirus is still only partly understood. All respiratory viruses cause non-specific local and systemic symptoms such as fever, cough, rhinitis, fatigue, and headache, which makes it impossible to clinically differentiate between illnesses caused by specific pathogens. Even with influenza, which is often considered to have a typical clinical manifestation, the diagnosis based on clinical grounds only is inaccurate. 5 This is particularly true in young children who are unable to express subjective symptoms.Etiologic diagnosis of respiratory infection would be needed in the setting of pediatric emergency department to target antiviral therapy of influenza and to prevent transmission of viruses in the hospital by means of patient cohorting and optimized infection control measures. Additional benefits of viral detection might include reduction of the use of chest X-rays or laboratory investigations, avoidance of overuse of antibiotics, and better prediction of the clinical course. 6 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become a standard method in respiratory viral diagnostics. This is due to its high sensitivity, good availability, and shorter delay in results in comparison with conventional methods such as viral culture. 7 Multiplex reverse transcription (RT) PCR methods allow detection of several viruses at the same time. However, RT-PCR, or viral antigen detection performed in a laboratory, does not provide information timely for clinical decisions at the emergency department.Point-of-care (POC) tests are designed to be available directly at the site of patient care, accessible to staff without laboratory training, and provide results quickly enough to have an impact on clinical decision-making. 8 For influenza A and B viruses and RSV, POC testing has been used frequently, although studies evaluating diagnostic performance of these tests have provided varying results. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] The practicality of POC tests in the emergency department may be compromised by the need of hands-on time for performing the test or unclear visualization of the result.  Objectives  The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance and practical usability of a novel multianalyte detection system for eight respiratory viruses, the mariPOC ® (ArcDia International Oy Ltd., Turku, Finland), in a clinical ambulatory care setting. We compared the results of this rapid antigen detection test performed in the pediatric emergency department with multiplex RT-PCR test performed in laboratory conditions.  Participant recruitment  Participants were recruited prospectively between January 11 and March 17, 2011, in the pediatric emergency department of Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland. The department serves children between 0 and 16 years of age. Patients were eligible for the comparative study between the mariPOC ® test and RT-PCR if they were hospitalized from the emergency department with respiratory symptoms (cough, rhinitis, wheezing) or fever without a focus, or if they were treated as outpatients for a respiratory infection suspected to be caused by influenza virus, RSV, or adenovirus. Suspicion of these viruses was used as an inclusion criterion because we have earlier used other POC tests routinely for detection of influenza A or B virus, RSV, and adenovirus. Influenza was suspected in patients with high fever and cough, RSV in those with bronchiolitis or other wheezing illness, and adenovirus in those with non-streptococcal tonsillitis.Patients with two or more visits to the emergency department during the study period were included in the study only at the first visit when eligible. Parents were asked to fill out an inquiry about chronic illnesses of the child, onset of symptoms and the immunization status for seasonal influenza. Other clinical data were derived from the medical records.The Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Southwest Finland approved the study protocol. Parents of all participating children gave their informed consent.  Specimen collection  Nasopharyngeal samples were collected by using flocked swabs (Copan, Brescia, Italy). A nasopharyngeal swab was inserted through either nostril and specimen was collected from a depth of at least 7 cm. The swabs were eluted in 1.3 ml of RTI sample buffer (ArcDia International Oy Ltd., Turku, Finland) and inserted to the mariPOC ® multianalyte antigen detection test system at the pediatric emergency department immediately after sampling. Emergency department nurses, who collected the samples, were trained to use the test system by the manufacturer (1 h of training). After POC analysis, the remaining sample solution was transferred to the Virus Diagnostic Laboratory, Department of Virology, University of Turku. Samples from 74 children admitted to hospital were analyzed immediately by PCR tests, and samples from 84 children were stored at −70 • C until analyzed. In 11 cases the first sample was not available and RT-PCR was done from a new sample taken <72 h after the first one.  mariPOC ® test system  mariPOC ® multianalyte test system provides pathogen specific results for eight respiratory viruses from a single nasopharyngeal swab (influenza A and B viruses, RSV A/B, adenovirus, hMPV, and parainfluenza type 1, 2, and 3 viruses). Nasopharyngeal sample kit includes also a test for Streptococcus pneumoniae. The same test system also allows simultaneous detection of adenovirus and group A streptococcus from a throat swab. S. pneumoniae or throat swab results were not included in this study.The test is fully automated and allows random-access analysis. The platform applies proprietary two-photon fluorescence excitation detection technique and antigen detection by immunometric assay principle. 16 The technique is characterized with microvolume analysis and separation-free fluorescent measurement of bioaffinity binding reactions. 17 The nasopharyngeal swab sample in RTI sample buffer is inserted into the analyzer, capped and bar coded, for automated analysis. The analyzer dispenses sample in 20 l aliquots to parallel wells of the test plate, one well per pathogen. The wells contain the reagents in the dry state. The test system automatically reports, on to a screen of the user-interface, preliminary results after 20 min. Final results are reported after 2 h. In this study, final mariPOC ® results were compared with the results provided by the reference methods, with the exception of four cases when the mariPOC ® system failed to report final results. In these cases preliminary results were compared with the results of reference method.  Reference methods for detection of respiratory viruses  A multiplex PCR assay (Seeplex RV12; Seegene, Seoul, Korea) was used as a reference method for detection of respiratory viruses (influenza A and B viruses, RSV A and B, adenovirus, hMPV, parainfluenza type 1, 2, and 3 viruses, rhinovirus A/B, and coronaviruses OC43/HKU1 and 229E/NL63). cDNA synthesis was performed using random-hexamer primers (Fermentas, York, UK). Multiplex PCR assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sensitivity of the multiplex PCR test for influenza B virus from samples stored at −70 • C was found to be lower than that from fresh samples. Therefore, an in house PCR test was used as a reference method for the detection of influenza B virus in stored samples. The PCR was performed as described earlier. 18 The primers and probes have been described earlier. 19 The specimens with contradictory results for influenza B in multiplex and in-house PCR tests were tested also by a time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay method, which gave accordant results with the in-house PCR test.  Data analyses  Data were analyzed by descriptive methods. Sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values with 95% confidence intervals were calculated separately for each virus regardless of detection of two viruses in some samples. Days from onset of symptoms to sampling were compared between subgroups a Diabetes mellitus (n = 1), APECED (n = 1), oligoarthritis (n = 1), pulmonary disease other than asthma (n = 2), anorexia nervosa (n = 1), prematurity (n = 1), renal insufficiency (n = 1), and Crohn's disease (n = 1). by t-test after Levene's test for equality of variances, with two-sided p = 0.05 as the limit of statistical significance.  Results  Samples from a total of 158 children were tested both by the mariPOC ® test system and by RT-PCR. Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1 . The median age of the children was 1.8 years (interquartile range, 0.6-7.1 years). Sixty-nine patients (44%) were admitted to hospital.Clinical personnel of the emergency department regarded the mariPOC ® test system as easy to use at the point of care. The positive results were available already within 20 min in 76% of patients with a final positive result for at least one virus. In 1% of patients the preliminary result was reported as positive but the final result was negative. The median time between onset of symptoms and sampling was 3 days for the cases positive already in the preliminary report (n = 54) vs. 5 days in those positive only in the final report (n = 15, p = 0.07). The time from onset of symptoms to sampling was not significantly longer in children with false negative result in mariPOC compared to children with positive results in both mariPOC and PCR (median, 3.5 vs. 3 days, p = 0.36). mariPOC ® and RT-PCR were done in separate samples in 11 cases. The time interval between obtaining these samples was less than 24 h in 9 cases, 44 h in 1 case, and 66 h in 1 case. In these latter two cases RSV was detected both by mariPOC ® and by RT-PCR. Time delay between sampling did therefore not affect results in these cases.The multiplex RT-PCR method Seeplex RV12 detects rhinoviruses and coronaviruses OC43/HKU1 and 229E/NL63, which are not included in the mariPOC ® test system. The mariPOC ® system was positive for at least 1 of 8 viruses in 69 of 158 samples (44%). In comparison, the RT-PCR was positive for at least 1 of 8 viruses covered by the mariPOC ® in 84 (53%), and for at least 1 of the 12 analyzed viruses in 104 (66%) of 158 samples ( Table 2) . RT-PCR detected rhinovirus in 12 (7.6%) and coronaviruses in 13 (8.2%) children. Eleven samples were positive for 2 viruses by multiplex RT-PCR and 2 samples were positive for 2 viruses by mariPOC ® . None of the samples were positive for more than 2 viruses. Sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values of the mariPOC ® system for each virus in comparison with RT-PCR are shown in Table 3 . Influenza (A or B) was detected in 29 children by RT-PCR and in 24 of them also by the mariPOC ® test system (18 (75%) after 20 min in the preliminary report), giving an overall sensitivity of 83% for any influenza. Thirty-five children in the study population were positive for RSV by RT-PCR. mariPOC ® detected RSV in 31 of these patients (sensitivity 89% and specificity 100%), and 28 (90%) of the positive results were reported already after 20 min. The mariPOC ® test gave sensitivity of 25% for adenovirus compared with RT-PCR. Nine samples were negative for adenovirus by mariPOC ® but positive by PCR. Six of these 9 samples were double positive findings by multiplex-PCR; in 3 samples adenovirus was found together with RSV, in 2 with hMPV and in 1 with rhinovirus. HMPV was detected in 8 patients by RT-PCR and in 4 of them also by mariPOC ® . The small number of parainfluenza virus findings prevented evaluation of the test's diagnostic performance for these viruses, as only two samples were positive for parainfluenza type 2 virus, and three samples for parainfluenza type 3 virus by RT-PCR.  Discussion  The mariPOC ® antigen detection system was highly specific and moderately sensitive in the diagnostics of influenza and RSV infections in children. The test system had a sensitivity of 83% for influenza viruses and 89% for RSV, with specificities of 97% or higher for all tested viruses, in comparison with RT-PCR. These test characteristics are satisfactory in clinical settings where rapid reporting of results outweighs the minor limitations in sensitivity.Since the availability of effective neuraminidase inhibitor drugs for treatment of influenza, there has been a need for rapid influenza tests in ambulatory clinics. 20 This need was highlighted during 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, but official instructions guided healthcare providers to use PCR tests instead of POC tests because of the poor sensitivity of the latter. Studies have reported sensitivities of 19-27% and specificities of 97-100% for influenza POC tests when compared with RT-PCR. 11, 21, 22 However, in studies in children, better sensitivities and specificities of POC tests for influenza have been reported. 9, 14, 23 This may be partly due to higher viral loads in children than in adults. 24, 25 In a study of influenza POC test, with immunofluorescence test or viral culture as the reference method instead of more sensitive RT-PCR, sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 97% were reported. 26 Earlier commercially available POC tests might have challenges especially in detection of influenza B virus. 11, 14, 27 The mariPOC ® test performed well in detection of both influenza A and B viruses, but the sensitivity for influenza A had a large confidence interval due to the low number of cases.Yearly RSV epidemics are a major cause for hospitalizations of children. Although antiviral treatment is not available, the benefits of rapid detection of RSV have been demonstrated. 28 In detection of RSV, the performance of mariPOC ® test appears to be comparable to other rapid tests, which have been documented to be both sensitive and specific. 10, 15, 29 The diagnostic yield of the mariPOC ® test was fairly good with a detection of virus in 44% of samples. Higher diagnostic yield of RT-PCR resulted from better sensitivity and from detection of rhinoviruses and coronaviruses that are not included in the mariPOC ® system. The yield and possibly also diagnostic performance of the mariPOC ® test system might be different in another epidemiologic situation. We purposefully conducted our study during a season when influenza viruses and RSV were circulating in the community, because the need for rapid testing appears to be highest for these viruses. From January to March 2011, pandemic-type influenza A (H1N1) and influenza B of Yamagata line were the dominant strains of influenza viruses in Finland. Influenza A dominated the epidemic in January and influenza B in February and March. Thus, the higher number of influenza B than influenza A viruses in our study reflects the epidemiologic situation. The fairly high proportion of samples positive for RSV in our study is in accordance with the epidemiologic occurrence of RSV during winter-spring, 2011, in Finland.Adenovirus was often detected by PCR simultaneously with another respiratory virus. Possibly in some of these cases adenovirus was an innocent bystander, and the other virus was the pathogen. Indeed, adenovirus has been detected in some studies frequently also from asymptomatic individuals by PCR. 30 These data suggest that multiplex RT-PCR may have in some settings excessively high sensitivity leading to clinically irrelevant findings.The mariPOC ® test system was found to be easy to incorporate in the work of clinical personnel in the emergency department. Short hands-on time was regarded as an important advantage over earlier used non-automated POC tests. In 76% of the positive cases the result was received already in the preliminary report at 20 min. Rapid and clear reporting of the results and automated archiving of the data were considered as important features of the test system by the users. Costs were not evaluated in this study but they can be suggested to be lower by the POC test system compared with multiplex PCR.Our results demonstrate that the mariPOC ® test system provides a new option for the detection of multiple respiratory viruses from a single nasopharyngeal swab in a rapid and user-friendly way. The test system had a high specificity for all tested viruses and it had a moderately high sensitivity for detecting influenza viruses and RSV. Further clinical evaluation regarding identification of hMPV, adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses by the test system is needed.  Funding  This study was financially supported by the Academy of Finland (grant no. 140251) and Central Finland Central Hospital Found (grant no. B0838). ArcDia International Oy Ltd. provided the mariPOC ® test system and partially the reference tests.  Competing interests  None declared.  Ethical approval  The Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Southwest Finland approved the study protocol. Parents of all participating children gave their informed consent.  				1				
9104376	Potentiating health and the crisis of the immune system: integrative approaches to prevention and healing of modern diseases	https://doi.org/10.1016/s0738-3991(97)01013-6		  The aim of the Dead Sea forum is to establish a base for international conferences, held so far in Israel, to explore the many aspects of (self)healing in health care and medicine. The goals of the conferences are to encourage a better understanding of health and medicine, The self-healing capacities of people play a central role in this approach. The third conference was held in October 1996 (Zichron Yaacov, Mount of Carmel) on the 'Potentiating Health and the Crisis of the Immune System'. The organizers stressed that 'The world is an era of integration, synthesis, better understanding and willingness to listen. There is a new potential to cooperative politically, socially and in the most important areas of health and medicine. Currently, there is a tremendous interest in potentiating health. Yet, this is far from being achieved. The list of today's modern sicknesses is long: disordered immunity and resistance, chronic diseases (mainly rheumatic problems, multiple sclerosis), allergy, asthma, eczema, cancer and AIDS. Since most conventional methods have failed to prevent and/or treat these health problems, new approaches are required. These approaches will integrate conventional and alternative techniques, inspired by a more compassionate and holistic view of the human being, nature and our planet. The issue of stress, mind-body health, ' An impression of the Third Dead Sea Conference, October 20-24, 1996, Zichron Yaacov, Israel. vitality and energy of diet and lifestyle, as well as self-care and health education, should be our major concerns' [l] . The 3rd Dead Sea Conference, provided an overview of wide spectrum of subjects, stressing the importance integrative approaches to prevention and healing of modern diseases.  Integrative models  In several presentations theoretically oriented integrative models were presented. Elliot Dacher (USA) stressed in a historical perspective the results of the traditional objective, reductional, positivistic approach in medicine. The negative consequences were corrected by the post-modern approach, emphasizing multidimensional causes of diseases, intentionality, holism and personal empowerment [2] .Christine Page (UK) viewed, as stated in her abstract that 'Illness is often seen as a failure or weakness. Yet, many would recognize the experience as a 'wake up' call and as an opportunity for change. Indeed, when we look beneath the surface there is much to be learnt from the signs and symptoms which both patient and carer, a clear picture as to the direction taken. We are, as humans, more than just our physical body. We possess a very powerful mind with instincts, emotions, logic and intuition integrated with our essential spirit. Physical illness often occurs in response to a deeper impulse from within urging the individual to change or consideration of their actions. By understanding the subtle energies, especially in relation to the chakra system, it is possible to recognize the links between personality and illness, and illness and soul growth there by enhancing the potential of the experience. In her contribution she presented a review of the psychosomatics of several diseases, emphasizing the important spiritual: impulses emotional expression, autonomy in the self-healing capacities of men and women. She concluded the preventive medicine cannot occur until all health care professionals acknowledge the power and the effect of the mind, body and spirit when they function in harmony. Education of the patient must start with the career, [3] .Robbert LaFaille (Belgium) reviewed the new science of health. In his view health promotion and preventive medicine developed during the last decades. A lot initiatives and policy measures were taken. Not always on a sound scientific basis. The call for a 'new science of health' is an invitation to develop a more solid basis for health oriented action. In his overview of developments he draw attention new insight in placebo-effects, the world wide life-style changes (also in the WHO healthy cities project), the increasing body-awareness (meditation, revalidation), the importance of research using biographics. He gave a rather optimistic view on a changing world with less pollution, healthy life style, and spiritual inspiration.Nimrod Sheinman (Israel), an experienced psychotherapist for cancer patients presented a lecture on 'Archetypes, metaphors and inner dialogues-guided imagery and the potentiation of health'. He stressed that there is a growing field of clinical and scientific evidence pointing to the efficacy, complexity and power of mind/body medicine. Beyond all the research findings and the medical investigations, the field raises some key concepts and differentiations, with crucial clinical impact and outcome: The integration of these concepts into medical practice needs a unique tlZ%apeutic languageone that would be able to touch and bridge the body and mind, transform biology, experience and quality of existence, and unite the science of medicine with the art of healing. It is the premise of this presentation that guided imagery-the language of metaphors, symbols and inner dialogues-perhaps the most subjective of all our clinical tools, is potentially one of the most powerful in tapping the person's true source of being and in initiating a process of both healing and transformation.He presented excellent paintings by cancer patients, illustrating their changes during guided imagery and psychosynthesis inspirited psychotherapy.Stephen Fulder (Israel) reviewed 'The health consequences of competing conventional and alternative definitions of health'. He stated in his abstract 'Health and resistance to disease are not often defined. They are relatively invisible concepts implicit in medicine. Conventional medicine has an operational definition of health as lack of obvious pathological symptoms. This can lead to a frustrating lack of interest in health and its manifestations. It can have drastic effects on our experience of illness and health. An utopian definition is sometimes used, such as by the World Health Organization, but it has no practical outcomes'. He described other views on health as a response to the extremely mechanistic view of the human being within modern medicine. They all have major effects on our health. For example the perspective of symptoms theory and the salutogenic concepts of Antonovsky reduces the power of the individual human being to protect his health, and gives responsibility to society and its institutions for health problems. This has led to health promotion schemes, which have had disappointing results. Alternative medicine involves a rich and ancient source of experience into the nature of health and human resistance to disease. Most alternative therapies i Patient Education and Counseling .30 (1997) 201-208 203 see the individual and his life's journey as the key to health or sickness. They acknowledge that health is essentially a mystery, like life itself, but that there are ways to life, and to seek treatment, which can increase our resistance, our health and our well-being. The alternative therapies imply an open-ended.tiew of health, stating that it is defined only in relation to the context of that individual at that moment. There is a belief in the natural will to be well, the self-healing powers, which are affirmed and supported. There is usually a more 'natural' or unfabricated orientation, with less confidence in drastic and unsafe treatments, and less intervention, i.e. more respect for the integrity and experience of the human being. These views are essentially vitalistic, and as such run counter to the mechanistic world view of modern life. This can create a real struggle for patients, and nowhere is this better illustrated than in the prevention of chronic diseases. For example a mechanistic orientation to cancer prevention can lead to fitness obsessions and the consumption of vitamins. A vitalistic orientation, in contrast, will lead to the direction of an harmonious and balanced life. In any treatment the same conflict can emerge. Alternative medicine itself can be mechanistic for example in formula acupuncture or 'quick-fix' chiropractic, and as such unsatisfying to many patients. It is very helpful to expose and explore these underlying themes, so that both patients and practitioners learn more deeply the basis of the various ways on offer at present to prevent and treat disease [4] .Roger Newman Turner (UK) presented views on 'Health and healing: developing our potential' Health has been defined as the realization of the capacity for maximum enjoyment of life with or without infirmity.In spite of having greater physical, biochemical, and spiritual resources to enable to attain and maintain health. the burden of chronic disease and the crisis of the immune system continue unabated. An examination of the reasons we become unwell suggests it is no longer sufficient to confront the agents or symptoms of disease or even to facilitate the inherent self-healing mechanisms. With so much now capable of overwhelming these it has become essential to examine and develop ways in which the healing response can be potentiated. While the means to enhance healing now exist at the biochemical, physical, and psychological levels perhaps we also need to develop our own potential as healers. He stressed the epistemology of the subjective, beside the objective, coldly, clinician view: 'diagnosing the patients instead of the disease'. The ethos of healing should include: respect, responsibility, receptiveness, curiosity, flexibility, culture, insight in the subjective meaning of the illness.Zvi Bentwich (Israel) presented a paper on 'Conventional medicine at a crossroad-meeting the challenge of complementary medicine'. He stated that 'Conventional Medicine is now facing a critical stage in its development, with the growing awareness of its shortcomings, despite the tremendous technical and scientific achievements it has gained. The remarkable success of the technological disciplines, particularly in the area of diagnosis, the fantastic developments, especially in the intervention surgical disciplines, and the new fast developing scientific fields, such as that of molecular biology, are all testimony for the tremendous progression biomedical sciences have made. And yet, as an indicator for the shortcomings, a growing proportion of the population in all western countries, seek the help of alternative-complemental medicine, in solving various health problems that have not been solved by regular medicine. Several reasons may account for this striking discrepancy between the tremendous scientific achievements on the one hand and the public dissatisfaction, on the other hand. The most important reason being the neglect of the human aspect of disease and alienation of the medical systems, and the chronic nature of diseases most common in the affluent societies of the west. The continuous growth of the complex and huge medical centers, as best representatives of modern medicine, has not helped to overcome these shortcomings. This phase in the development of conventional medicine should therefore be viewed as a phase of true challenge and possible change of direction. Complementary medicine presents one aspect of this challenge: (1) It presents empirical claims that need to be substantiated by regular clinical investigation. (2) It opens up questions of unrecognized and undefined mechanisms of disease not properly and seriously dealt with before scientifically. (3) It raises the issue of mind body interactions as a central factor in disease. (4) It presents concrete examples for a better doctorpatient relationship. These challenges should be met and special efforts to make the most of them should be encouraged. Conventional medicine should try to integrate as much as possible from complementary approaches including some of the more distant philosophies behind these disciplines'.More specific integrative models were presented by Geraldine Mitton (South Africa) on Food as medicine for body and soul, to restore a state of balance and harmony in the body. Guillermo Michel Sinner (Mexico) approach was philosophical:'The wounded body: towards a phenomenology of health and illness'. He started from Maurice Merleau-Ponty, viewing illness as a mode of being -in -the -world, emphasizing the existential ground of the 'symbolic function' and structure of illness.The presented theoretical models were one of the most interesting aspects of the conference. However, sometimes a lot of 'words, words., .' and not time enough time to define or re-define the compelling concepts of these integrative approaches.  Integrative techniques and workshops  Beside the more theoretical approaches of the integrative models, also integrative techniques and workshops were presented. In the workshops the participants could taste the several therapeutical approaches of the specialists in the field of self-healing techniques. A great variety of integrative techniques were presented at the conference. More than 25 lectures were held. Several of them were wellknown and often already accepted techniques in medicine: reflexiology, massage, meditation, hydrotherapy, biofeedback, and bioenergetics. Less well-known techniques may concern apitherpay (less venom therapy) for intractable chronic painful diseases, Rolfing (structural reintegration of the body posture), shark cartilage (for cancer patients), and functional electrodynamical testing. There were great differences in the presentations of the evidence of the several integrative techniques. In general, in only a few cases empirical results were shown. This may not mean that the empirical evidence does not exist, but that the need for facts is lower in case of preaching for the own community. However, also a feature of traditional medicine.  Cancer  Cancer is traditionally an illness with several alternative and self-healing approaches [5] . A lot of patients rely on it and are users of com-plementary care in cancer. Van der Zouwe estimates that in the Netherlands about 15% of the cancer patients use alternative approaches. At the conference, Shin-ichiro Terayama (Japan) presented his history of spontaneous regression of metastasized kidney cancer (seven years ago). He described his story of recovery from cancer with cello playing. He confessed how he loved his cancer instead of fighting it. He changed to a vegetarian 'macrobiotic' diet, selected good mineral water, and most importantly watched the sun rise in the morning: 'It was in front of the morning sun that I made an exciting discovery. I found I was becoming very positive, very relaxed and healing energy was entering me first through my heart, and then all seven chakras. I began to play cello again after a long absence. These things were practiced harmoniously by intuition and not by instruction'. He concluded that it is the time for modern medicine to recognize the ancient wisdom of human beings to bring about their own recovery from cancer.Another personal journey concerned 'Reality and myths about breast cancer', the story of Galia Sefchovicl (Mexico). She described how cancer is related to the amount of loving energy that people need to survive. She raised a lot of questions: How can we get in touch with this energy and maintain its constant flow? How can we get stronger in out faith? How can we grow with our families and friends during this process? How to search in the sea of alternative medicine and approaches? What to do with the fear of death or the guilt of survival? Beside these impressive personal stories, also more structural educational and counseling in cancer care were presented.Susan Silberstein (USA) gave a excellent review on 'Non-conventional cancer therapies: criteria for evaluation and rationales for implementation-helping patients decide'. She stated in her abstract that as the failure of radiation and chemotherapy to cure most cancers has become more apparent in recent year, dozens of alternative cancer therapies have commanded increasing attention. However, the complex world of unorthodox modalities can be confusing to patients and practitioners alike. Overwhelmed with information from the broadcast and print media, and torn by conflicting recommendations from ~~tnvention~ and ~~onventional sources, patients left to their own devices often make bad choices or no choices. Yet there is a place in oncology for unorthodox approaches as either adjuncts or alternatives to traditional treatment. Three different therapeutic avenues in oncology with three distinct goals illustrate the shortcomings of conventional therapies targeting tumor reduction, the ways in which selected adjuvant treatment support host resistance, and the potential for biological repair with use of appropriate alternative modalities.Review of the major unconventional treatment classifications reveals an int~guing parallelism between experimental mainstream therapies-hypertherminas, hormone therapies and immunotherapies-and the best of the 'unproven therapies-clinical nutrition, botanical medicine and psychoneuroimmunology.Criteria for evaluating unorthodox therapies need to be stringent, with the ideal program focusing on the essential distinction between a host-oriented and a tumor-oriented approach. When tumor reduction remains the primary goal, results with alternative therapies have been inconsistent and sometimes not significantly better than with orthodox methods. The programs which have produced the most consistent results are those recognize the body as a self-healing mechanism by giving it the essential tools for immunocompetence and self-repair. By respecting the common ground which conventional and nonconventional approaches can meet and by seeking an appropriate marriage between the body's own natural healing potential and the best that medical science has to offer, health professionals can play an important role in helping their patients to design individualized intervention plans and to make the most effective therapeutic choices'.A Dutch presentation was about a model for 'Existential counseling in cancer patients' (Visser). Peoples with cancer experience a lot of existential problems. The Dutch regular health care facilities (hospitals, mental health organizations) do not offer a specific help for them. At the Helen Dowling Institute people with cancer may receive psychotherapy based on experiential and existential schools in the counseling tradition.In a retrospective study among clients the counseling has been evaluated. The aim was to get insight in the psychosocial changes due to the counseling, and to measure the satisfaction of the clients. Standardized questionnaires were used, combined with semi-structured interviews, audiotapes and scored by two independent judges. The clients report a number of emotional, cognitive and social changes. These changes were related with the satisfaction of the clients with the therapy. The 'presence' of the therapist seems to be the main explaining mechanism to integrate the meaning of living with cancer in the clients and to raise their quality of life.Ton Staps (Netherlands) described the principles of and the experiences with 'Psycho-energetic therapy and the search for meaning'. This is a method to aid patients mobilize their physical, psychological, social and spiritual resources in order to cope with many and often drastic changes in their lives. It includes regular counseling/psychotherapy and a variety of body/mind interventions. The latter are dived to assist the release of physical and emotional tensions and the build-up of a reservoir. They also play an important role in the search for meaning. A basic construct in the PET is the five dimensions model; attention, communication, emotions, body, mind. Although the five dimensions are equal important, in coping, the dimension mind has a leading role. The basis of the copingprocess is the search for meaning which takes place. Corresponding with the partly different tasks of the cerebral hemispheres, the distinction is made between the logic mind and the metaphoric activity of the logic mind the self is placed opposite of the non-self, where in the metaphorical mind the self is aware of the relation with the non-self. The therapy helps the patient to find the dynamic balance between the active logical process of giving meaning of being ill and the awareness of being a part of a meaningful whole.More medical approaches in the alternative cancer approaches was the treatment of carcinoma with human placental extract (Harris Coulter, USA). Just a placenta mediates between the host (pregnant woman) and the trophoblast or embryo, so its products can mediate between the host and the tumor. Specifically, injection seems to cause B-cells o?e tianzer patients to produce anti-suppressor antibodies which form complexes with the 'blocking factors' protecting the tumor from the action of the host immune system. These and other products of the cancerous cells are then eliminated from the body through the liver, and the tumor, deprived of its protection, is thereafter vulnerable to the action of the host immune system. This treatment is most effective in carcinoma and melanoma. less indicated in sarcoma and leukemias. Patients recently diagnosed with cancer, who have the primary tumor surgically removed, and who have not had either radiation or chemotherapy, respond particularly well. It may also be used prophylactically-in persons whose cancers have been treated with success in the past but who are concerned about relapse. A few cases were presented about the affectivity of this approach in cancer treatment.William Lane (USA) presented his cancer treatment by means of 'Whole shark cartilage, minerals and all, as a therapy with non-responsive cancer'. Shark cartilage and its use with non-responsive solid cancerous tumors. (Generally stage IV case) Has become widely known in alternative medicine. The mechanism of action, believed to be angiogenes inhibition,The FDA has given phase 2 approval to a study on metastasized, and non-responsive prostate cancer and Karposi's Sarcoma for a unique specially processed shark cartilage product called Benefini. Also a clinical trial on prostate cancer has been started. The FDA approved protocol including tumor reduction, PSA tumor marker response, quality of life measurements including Karposi's Index, blood work and other criteria.Cancer draw the attention of a lot of alternative and complementary approaches. A life threatening disease urges people look for help in their existential crisis, a area with a lot of proven and speculative approaches. ! Patient Education and Counseling 30 (1997) 201-208 207 4. Immune approachThe title of the third Dead Sea Conference stressed 'the crisis of the immune system'. However, this was the less well developed part of the meeting. It lacked of a general review on the state of the art of modern immunology.Most of the participants needed more background information on immunology in order to understand what it means 'the function of the immune system'. Nicholas Plotnikoff (USA) presented interesting, however complex, information on 'Methionine enkephalin -a new cytokine with antiviral and antitumor activities'. He showed that 'enkephalin has been identified to be derived from its prohormone, pro"enkephalin A in macrophages and T helper cells. Its immunological profile is similar to interleukin 2 and gamma interferon. Met-enkephalin specifically increases numbers of cytotoxic cells (CD8 and NK) that are effective against viruses and tumors. Antivial activity was demonstrated against Herpes, AIDS, CMV, coronavirus, FluA, and Japanese Encephalitis either alone or in combination with known anti-virals. Anti-tumor activity was seen against melanoma, sarcoma, lung cancer, colon, leukemia, and neuroblastoma. Clinical studies in AIDS and cancer patients were discussed'.A more speculative view was presented by Annemarie Colbin (USA) on 'Setting up the immune system: perinatal influences'. She described in her abstract that human beings are born with a functioning yet immature immune system already in place. Several influences around the time of birth will enhance or weaken it. The genetic influence of the parents and ancestors is a given, and not under their control. Influences that are under a reasonable amount of control include the basic health of the parents as a result of their diet and the use (or non-use) of drugs and alcohol. During pregnancy, the mother's diet and use (or non-use) of drugs and alcohol will more specifically affects the fetus. The type of birth experience, natural or with drugs, vaginal or caesarean, will affect the child's central nervous system. Perhaps the most important early immune enhancer is breast-feeding and specifically the infant's intake of colostrum; the symbiotic feedback loop between mother and infant sets up the basic working of the immune system for life, Therefore, a history of bottle feeding may indicate a priori a weaker immune system. It is the suggestion that health professionals always inquire if their clients have been breast or bottle fed, and long of each. Three other influences upon the immune system were discussed: (a) the infant's diet once solid are introduced; (b) the use of antibiotics: (c) the use of vaccins.Another presented immunological view was on 'Cancer, psychosocial factors and immunity: steps on a hard way' (Visser, NL). There is a substantial increase in psycho-oncologic research and interveni.ion studies that focusing on the role of psychosocial factors in disease progression. However, along with this growth have come inconsistencies in research findings. There is also a lack of a biological explanation of the results of psychosocial interventions in cancer patients. Results were reported on the intervention and psychosocial determinants studies on: breast cancer, cervical cancer, melanoma and prostate cancer. The studies are based on a stressor-support-coping model, developed in cooperation with researchers at the University of Miami (USA). It was discussed which psychosocial factors contribute to the course of cancer, and which factors may be influenced by therapeutical inte~entions.Also the difficulties were stressed to study the course of cancer, and to measure and use immunological data.  Conclusion  Participation in the Third Dead Sea Conference was a stimulating, exciting and sometimes astonishing experience. The small group of participants (about 60) created a warm personal and open group climate. There was respect for the great variety of ideas and approaches, practicalIy as well as theoretically.Only a few times the presentations raised heavy discussions, like in the discussion on the possible side effects of vaccination and on the limitations and difficulties of immunological approaches. The traditional re-search approach was scare, however, there were also good examples of empirical studies, like Carl Stonier's study on the effects of counseling for angina pectoris and myocardial infarction [l] , the presented studies on education and counseling for cancer patients [6] and Kim's presentation on Bee Vernon therapy for painful diseases [7] . The so called crisis of the immune system did not get much attention. Is there a general crisis? In which populations. 3 How to measure? So, several unanswered questions. Immunology seems to be a metaphor in the new-aged engaged health care providers. There is still a big gap between integrate approaches using the human (self) healing potention and its measurable effects in immune functioning as well as the course of diseases. Due to this gap, there is a strong need for education and counseling on the integrative approaches to prevention and healing in modern diseases.  			1				1	
15496687	Impact of a severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in the emergency department: an experience in Taiwan	https://emj.bmj.com/content/emermed/21/6/660.full.pdf	Objectives: To evaluate the impact of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in the emergency department (ED). Methods: Computerised records of all ED visits in January and May 2003 were analysed and compared, representing before and during the SARS epidemic respectively. Data were grouped into two categories. Group 1 was the indicators of impact on patients, including visitor's condition classification, number of patients that died on arrival (DOA), received cardiopulmonary resuscitation, underwent endotracheal intubation, needed mechanical ventilation, discharged against medical advice (AAD), died in the ED, and the admission rate to wards. Group 2 was the indicators of impact on the quality of medical care, including number of visits that returned within 72 hours (early returns), underwent chest radiography, upper abdomen sonography or computed tomography, and the length of stay. Results: There were 6650 and 3901 consecutive encounters in January and May 2003 respectively. There were significant differences on condition classifications (p = 0.000), increased rate of patients that underwent endotracheal intubation (p = 0.003), needed mechanical ventilation (p = 0.020), and admission (p = 0.000). The rate of AAD decreased significantly (p = 0.024). There was no significant difference on early returns, although the length of stay in the ED increased (p = 0.043). The number of visits that underwent chest radiological examination increased (p = 0.000) and upper abdomen sonography (p = 0.007) decreased significantly in May. Conclusions: SARS had an impact on the medical service system and decreased visits by 40% in the ED. Patients visiting the ED had more severe conditions than before. The impact of SARS on quality of medical care can be minimised when adequate infection control measures are applied.								1	
18596085	Preferential Cytolysis of Peripheral Memory CD4(+) T Cells by In Vitro X4-Tropic Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Infection before the Completion of Reverse Transcription	https://jvi.asm.org/content/82/18/9154.full.pdf	CD4(+) T-cell depletion is the hallmark of AIDS pathogenesis. Multiple mechanisms may contribute to the death of productively infected CD4(+) T cells and innocent-bystander cells. In this study, we characterize a novel mechanism in which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection preferentially depletes peripheral memory CD4(+) T cells before the completion of reverse transcription. Using a recombinant HIV-1 carrying the green fluorescent protein reporter gene, we demonstrate that memory CD4(+) T cells were susceptible to infection-induced cell death at a low multiplicity of infection. Infected memory CD4(+) T cells underwent rapid necrotic cell death. Killing of host cells was dependent on X4 envelope-mediated viral fusion, but not on virion-associated Vpr or Nef. In contrast to peripheral resting CD4(+) T cells, CD4(+) T cells stimulated by mitogen or certain cytokines were resistant to HIV-1-induced early cell death. These results demonstrate that early steps in HIV-1 infection have a detrimental effect on certain subsets of CD4(+) T cells. The early cell death may serve as a selective disadvantage for X4-tropic HIV-1 in acute infection but may play a role in accelerated disease progression, which is associated with the emergence of X4-tropic HIV-1 in the late stage of AIDS.						1			
12502799	Conformational Changes in the Spike Glycoprotein of Murine Coronavirus Are Induced at 37°C either by Soluble Murine CEACAM1 Receptors or by pH 8	https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/77/2/830.full.pdf	The spike glycoprotein (S) of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) binds to viral murine CEACAM receptor glycoproteins and causes membrane fusion. On virions, the 180-kDa S glycoprotein of the MHV-A59 strain can be cleaved by trypsin to form the 90-kDa N-terminal receptor-binding subunit (S1) and the 90-kDa membrane-anchored fusion subunit (S2). Incubation of virions with purified, soluble CEACAM1a receptor proteins at 37°C and pH 6.5 neutralizes virus infectivity (B. D. Zelus, D. R. Wessner, R. K. Williams, M. N. Pensiero, F. T. Phibbs, M. deSouza, G. S. Dveksler, and K. V. Holmes, J. Virol. 72:7237-7244, 1998). We used liposome flotation and protease sensitivity assays to investigate the mechanism of receptor-induced, temperature-dependent virus neutralization. After incubation with soluble receptor at 37°C and pH 6.5, virions became hydrophobic and bound to liposomes. Receptor binding induced a profound, apparently irreversible conformational change in S on the viral envelope that allowed S2, but not S1, to be degraded by trypsin at 4°C. Various murine CEACAM proteins triggered conformational changes in S on recombinant MHV strains expressing S glycoproteins of MHV-A59 or MHV-4 (MHV-JHM) with the same specificities as seen for virus neutralization and virus-receptor activities. Increased hydrophobicity of virions and conformational change in S2 of MHV-A59 could also be induced by incubating virions at pH 8 and 37°C, without soluble receptor. Surprisingly, the S protein of recombinant MHV-A59 virions with a mutation, H716D, that precluded cleavage between S1 and S2 could also be triggered to undergo a conformational change at 37°C by soluble receptor at neutral pH or by pH 8 alone. A novel 120-kDa subunit was formed following incubation of the receptor-triggered S(A59)H716D virions with trypsin at 4°C. The data show that unlike class 1 fusion glycoproteins of other enveloped viruses, the murine coronavirus S protein can be triggered to a membrane-binding conformation at 37°C either by soluble receptor at neutral pH or by alkaline pH alone, without requiring previous activation by cleavage between S1 and S2.						1			
19740986	GBF1, a Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor for Arf, Is Crucial for Coxsackievirus B3 RNA Replication	https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/83/22/11940.full.pdf	The replication of enteroviruses is sensitive to brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi network transport that blocks activation of guanine exchange factors (GEFs) of the Arf GTPases. Mammalian cells contain three BFA-sensitive Arf GEFs: GBF1, BIG1, and BIG2. Here, we show that coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) RNA replication is insensitive to BFA in MDCK cells, which contain a BFA-resistant GBF1 due to mutation M832L. Further evidence for a critical role of GBF1 stems from the observations that viral RNA replication is inhibited upon knockdown of GBF1 by RNA interference and that replication in the presence of BFA is rescued upon overexpression of active, but not inactive, GBF1. Overexpression of Arf proteins or Rab1B, a GTPase that induces GBF1 recruitment to membranes, failed to rescue RNA replication in the presence of BFA. Additionally, the importance of the interaction between enterovirus protein 3A and GBF1 for viral RNA replication was investigated. For this, the rescue from BFA inhibition of wild-type (wt) replicons and that of mutant replicons of both CVB3 and poliovirus (PV) carrying a 3A protein that is impaired in binding GBF1 were compared. The BFA-resistant GBF1-M832L protein efficiently rescued RNA replication of both wt and mutant CVB3 and PV replicons in the presence of BFA. However, another BFA-resistant GBF1 protein, GBF1-A795E, also efficiently rescued RNA replication of the wt replicons, but not that of mutant replicons, in the presence of BFA. In conclusion, this study identifies a critical role for GBF1 in CVB3 RNA replication, but the importance of the 3A-GBF1 interaction requires further study.						1			
21849456	Molecular Epidemiology of Human Coronavirus OC43 Reveals Evolution of Different Genotypes over Time and Recent Emergence of a Novel Genotype due to Natural Recombination	https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/85/21/11325.full.pdf	Although human coronavirus OC43-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) is the coronavirus most commonly associated with human infections, little is known about its molecular epidemiology and evolution. We conducted a molecular epidemiology study to investigate different genotypes and potential recombination in HCoV-OC43. Twenty-nine HCoV-OC43 strains from nasopharyngeal aspirates, collected from 2004 to 2011, were subjected to RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike, and nucleocapsid gene analysis. Phylogenetic analysis showed at least three distinct clusters of HCoV-OC43, although 10 unusual strains displayed incongruent phylogenetic positions between RdRp and spike genes. This suggested the presence of four HCoV-OC43 genotypes (A to D), with genotype D most likely arising from recombination. The complete genome sequencing of two genotype C and D strains and bootscan analysis showed recombination events between genotypes B and C in the generation of genotype D. Of the 29 strains, none belonged to the more ancient genotype A, 5 from 2004 belonged to genotype B, 15 from 2004 to 2006 belonged to genotype C, and 1 from 2004 and all 8 from 2008 to 2011 belonged to the recombinant genotype D. Molecular clock analysis using spike and nucleocapsid genes dated the most recent common ancestor of all genotypes to the 1950s, genotype B and C to the 1980s, genotype B to the 1990s, and genotype C to the late 1990s to early 2000s, while the recombinant genotype D strains were detected as early as 2004. This represents the first study to describe natural recombination in HCoV-OC43 and the evolution of different genotypes over time, leading to the emergence of novel genotype D, which is associated with pneumonia in our elderly population.						1			
22696648	Bats Worldwide Carry Hepatitis E Virus-Related Viruses That Form a Putative Novel Genus within the Family Hepeviridae	https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/86/17/9134.full.pdf	Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the most common causes of acute hepatitis in tropical and temperate climates. Tropical genotypes 1 and 2 are associated with food-borne and waterborne transmission. Zoonotic reservoirs (mainly pigs, wild boar, and deer) are considered for genotypes 3 and 4, which exist in temperate climates. In view of the association of several zoonotic viruses with bats, we analyzed 3,869 bat specimens from 85 different species and from five continents for hepevirus RNA. HEVs were detected in African, Central American, and European bats, forming a novel phylogenetic clade in the family Hepeviridae. Bat hepeviruses were highly diversified and comparable to human HEV in sequence variation. No evidence for the transmission of bat hepeviruses to humans was found in over 90,000 human blood donations and individual patient sera. Full-genome analysis of one representative virus confirmed formal classification within the family Hepeviridae. Sequence- and distance-based taxonomic evaluations suggested that bat hepeviruses constitute a distinct genus within the family Hepeviridae and that at least three other genera comprising human, rodent, and avian hepeviruses can be designated. This may imply that hepeviruses invaded mammalian hosts nonrecently and underwent speciation according to their host restrictions. Human HEV-related viruses in farmed and peridomestic animals might represent secondary acquisitions of human viruses, rather than animal precursors causally involved in the evolution of human HEV.			1		1	1			
24942570	Analysis of Human Rotaviruses from a Single Location Over an 18-Year Time Span Suggests that Protein Coadaption Influences Gene Constellations	https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/88/17/9842.full.pdf	Rotaviruses (RVs) are 11-segmented, double-stranded RNA viruses that cause severe gastroenteritis in children. In addition to an error-prone genome replication mechanism, RVs can increase their genetic diversity by reassorting genes during host coinfection. Such exchanges allow RVs to acquire advantageous genes and adapt in the face of selective pressures. However, reassortment may also impose fitness costs if it unlinks genes/proteins that have accumulated compensatory, coadaptive mutations and that operate best when kept together. To better understand human RV evolutionary dynamics, we analyzed the genome sequences of 135 strains (genotype G1/G3/G4-P[8]-I1-C1-R1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1) that were collected at a single location in Washington, DC, during the years 1974 to 1991. Intragenotypic phylogenetic trees were constructed for each viral gene using the nucleotide sequences, thereby defining novel allele level gene constellations (GCs) and illuminating putative reassortment events. The results showed that RVs with distinct GCs cocirculated during the vast majority of the collection years and that some of these GCs persisted in the community unchanged by reassortment. To investigate the influence of protein coadaptation on GC maintenance, we performed a mutual information-based analysis of the concatenated amino acid sequences and identified an extensive covariance network. Unexpectedly, amino acid covariation was highest between VP4 and VP2, which are structural components of the RV virion that are not thought to directly interact. These results suggest that GCs may be influenced by the selective constraints placed on functionally coadapted, albeit noninteracting, viral proteins. This work raises important questions about mutation-reassortment interplay and its impact on human RV evolution. IMPORTANCE Rotaviruses are devastating human pathogens that cause severe diarrhea and kill >450,000 children each year. The virus can evolve by accumulating mutations and by acquiring new genes from other strains via a process called reassortment. However, little is known about the relationship between mutation accumulation and gene reassortment for rotaviruses and how it impacts viral evolution. In this study, we analyzed the genome sequences of human strains found in clinical fecal specimens that were collected at a single hospital over an 18-year time span. We found that many rotaviruses did not reassort their genes but instead maintained them as specific sets (i.e., constellations). By analyzing the encoded proteins, we discovered concurrent amino acid changes among them, which suggests that they are functionally coadapted to operate best when kept together. This study increases our understanding of how rotaviruses evolve over time in the human population.						1			
30258005	Virulent Pseudorabies Virus Infection Induces a Specific and Lethal Systemic Inflammatory Response in Mice	https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/92/24/e01614-18.full.pdf	Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an alphaherpesvirus that infects the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The natural host of PRV is the swine, but it can infect most mammals, including cattle, rodents, and dogs. In these nonnatural hosts, PRV always causes a severe acute and lethal neuropathy called the “mad itch,” which is uncommon in swine. Thus far, the pathophysiological and immunological processes leading to the development of the neuropathic itch and the death of the animal are unclear. Using a footpad inoculation model, we established that mice inoculated with PRV-Becker (virulent strain) develop a severe pruritus in the foot and become moribund at 82 h postinoculation (hpi). We found necrosis and inflammation with a massive neutrophil infiltration only in the footpad and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) by hematoxylin and eosin staining. PRV load was detected in the foot, PNS, and central nervous system tissues by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Infected mice had elevated plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 [IL-6] and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) and chemokines (Gro-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1). Significant IL-6 and G-CSF levels were detected in several tissues at 82 hpi. High plasma levels of C-reactive protein confirmed the acute inflammatory response to PRV-Becker infection. Moreover, mice inoculated with PRV-Bartha (attenuated, live vaccine strain) did not develop pruritus at 82 hpi. PRV-Bartha also replicated in the PNS, and the infection spread further in the brain than PRV-Becker. PRV-Bartha infection did not induce the specific and lethal systemic inflammatory response seen with PRV-Becker. Overall, we demonstrated the importance of inflammation in the clinical outcome of PRV infection in mice and provide new insights into the process of PRV-induced neuroinflammation. IMPORTANCE Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an alphaherpesvirus related to human pathogens such as herpes simplex virus 1 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The natural host of PRV is the swine, but it can infect most mammals. In susceptible animals other than pigs, PRV infection always causes a characteristic lethal pruritus known as the “mad itch.” The role of the immune response in the clinical outcome of PRV infection is still poorly understood. Here, we show that a systemic host inflammatory response is responsible for the severe pruritus and acute death of mice infected with virulent PRV-Becker but not mice infected with attenuated strain PRV-Bartha. In addition, we identified IL-6 and G-CSF as two main cytokines that play crucial roles in the regulation of this process. Our findings give new insights into neuroinflammatory diseases and strengthen further the similarities between VZV and PRV infections at the level of innate immunity.						1			
22282719	A sensitive near-infrared fluorescent probe for caspase-mediated apoptosis: Synthesis and application in cell imaging	https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ddt/5/5/5_2011.v5.5.220/_pdf	Near-infrared (NIR) absorbing dyes represent an intriguing avenue for extracting biological information from living subjects since they can be monitored with noninvasive optical imaging techniques. We designed and synthesized an imaging agent which contains a NIR fluorochrome (IR780) and peptidyl fluoromethyl ketone (FMK) for caspase-9 imaging of cells undergoing apoptosis. The IR780-FMK fluorescent probe had a Strokes shift of 79 nm and quantum yield 0.75. Prostate cancer DU145 cells undergoing apoptosis were successfully imaged using as little as 0.1 μM of IR780-FMK.					1				
10756009	The Viral Nucleocapsid Protein of Transmissible Gastroenteritis Coronavirus (TGEV) Is Cleaved by Caspase-6 and -7 during TGEV-Induced Apoptosis	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC111911/	The transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), like many other viruses, exerts much of its cytopathic effect through the induction of apoptosis of its host cell. Apoptosis is coordinated by a family of cysteine proteases, called caspases, that are activated during apoptosis and participate in dismantling the cell by cleaving key structural and regulatory proteins. We have explored the caspase activation events that are initiated upon infection of the human rectal tumor cell line HRT18 with TGEV. We show that TGEV infection results in the activation of caspase-3, -6, -7, -8, and -9 and cleavage of the caspase substrates eIF4GI, gelsolin, and α-fodrin. Surprisingly, the TGEV nucleoprotein (N) underwent proteolysis in parallel with the activation of caspases within the host cell. Cleavage of the N protein was inhibited by cell-permeative caspase inhibitors, suggesting that this viral structural protein is a target for host cell caspases. We show that the TGEV nucleoprotein is a substrate for both caspase-6 and -7, and using site-directed mutagenesis, we have mapped the cleavage site to VVPD(359)↓. These data demonstrate that viral proteins can be targeted for destruction by the host cell death machinery.						1			
10482652	Mutational Analysis of the Putative Fusion Domain of Ebola Virus Glycoprotein	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC112919/	Ebola viruses contain a single glycoprotein (GP) spike, which functions as a receptor binding and membrane fusion protein. It contains a highly conserved hydrophobic region (amino acids 524 to 539) located 24 amino acids downstream of the N terminus of the Ebola virus GP2 subunit. Comparison of this region with the structural features of the transmembrane subunit of avian retroviral GPs suggests that the conserved Ebola virus hydrophobic region may, in fact, serve as the fusion peptide. To test this hypothesis directly, we introduced conservative (alanine) and nonconservative (arginine) amino acid substitutions at eight positions in this region of the GP2 molecule. The effects of these mutations were deduced from the ability of the Ebola virus GP to complement the infectivity of a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) lacking the receptor-binding G protein. Some mutations, such as Ile-to-Arg substitutions at positions 532 (I532R), F535R, G536A, and P537R, almost completely abolished the ability of the GP to support VSV infectivity without affecting the transport of GP to the cell surface and its incorporation into virions or the production of virus particles. Other mutations, such as G528R, L529A, L529R, I532A, and F535A, reduced the infectivity of the VSV-Ebola virus pseudotypes by at least one-half. These findings, together with previous reports of liposome association with a peptide corresponding to positions 524 to 539 in the GP molecule, offer compelling support for a fusion peptide role for the conserved hydrophobic region in the Ebola virus GP.						1			
16948846	Natural products that reduce rotavirus infectivity identified by a cell-based moderate-throughput screening assay	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1564392/	BACKGROUND: There is widespread interest in the use of innate immune modulators as a defense strategy against infectious pathogens. Using rotavirus as a model system, we developed a cell-based, moderate-throughput screening (MTS) assay to identify compounds that reduce rotavirus infectivity in vitro, toward a long-term goal of discovering immunomodulatory agents that enhance innate responses to viral infection. RESULTS: A natural product library consisting of 280 compounds was screened in the assay and 15 compounds that significantly reduced infectivity without cytotoxicity were identified. Time course analysis of four compounds with previously characterized effects on inflammatory gene expression inhibited replication with pre-treatment times as minimal as 2 hours. Two of these four compounds, α-mangostin and 18-β-glycyrrhetinic acid, activated NFκB and induced IL-8 secretion. The assay is adaptable to other virus systems, and amenable to full automation and adaptation to a high-throughput format. CONCLUSION: Identification of several compounds with known effects on inflammatory and antiviral gene expression that confer resistance to rotavirus infection in vitro suggests the assay is an appropriate platform for discovery of compounds with potential to amplify innate antiviral responses.	Background  Interest in the use of innate immune modulating agents recently has increased in the context of developing effective biodefense strategies. Increasing natural disease resistance by administration of agonists that stimulate pathogen recognition receptors and gene expression pathways is an approach that would provide broad protection from infection without need for pathogen-specific vaccines. Stimulating broadly reactive immune responses to viral, as well as bacterial and protozoan pathogens, has shown efficacy in animal models and is the subject of recent reviews that address the utility of immune potentiators in developing infectious disease defense strategies [1, 2] . The number of such compounds currently in clinical development lends support for this approach [3] .To be seriously considered as a candidate antiviral drug or innate immune agonist, rapid and quantitative assess-ment of activity and toxicity in cell culture are prerequisite to lead compound development [4] . Therefore, development of screening assays in cell lines that can simultaneously support virus replication and be responsive to measures of inhibition of virus replication are a priority. Cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assays that test for compounds active against hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV and SARS coronavirus utilize recombinant viruses and changes in reporter gene expression in engineered cell lines to measure antiviral activity [5] [6] [7] [8] . For example, a dual replicon assay system that combined reporter gene assays and FRET was used to screen for drugs effective against HCV [5] . Advantages of these cited assays include rapid readout and an ability to perform screens with viruses that must be handled under elevated biosafety conditions.The intent of the studies reported here was to establish a cell-based screening assay that could identify compounds that inhibit virus replication by inducing antiviral gene expression pathways. Although the assay could identify compounds that target distinct steps of the virus replication cycle, we are interested in those that stimulate cellular responses necessary to confer initial resistance to rotavirus infection. The theory behind this approach is that amplification of the antiviral response will override virusencoded immune evasion strategies and restrict replication to subclinical levels.Rotaviruses are responsible for the majority of childhood morbidity and mortality from viral gastroenteritis [9] . Several rotavirus vaccines in clinical trials show promising efficacy, suggesting that a long-term goal of rotavirus gastroenteritis becoming a vaccine preventable disease is attainable [10] . However, the significant mortality associated with rotavirus illness in the developing world suggests approaches to enhance the antiviral immune response and consequent natural resistance to rotavirus infection need to be explored. The importance of this issue and the significant amount of data available on rotavirus replication led us to use this virus as a model system. We report development of an assay that uses unmodified adherent epithelial cells to measure reductions in rotavirus infectivity in response to treatment of cells with a variety of compounds. A natural product library consisting of 280 compounds derived from plant extracts was screened, and several compounds that inhibited rotavirus infectivity in a dose-dependent manner were identified. All of the compounds that passed the designated criteria of a hit have been reported to have direct effects on inflammatory or antiviral gene expression or on virus replication. Development of such a platform to screen compounds for the ability to diminish virus replication easily can be applied to other virus systems where direct measurement of activity in epithelial cells is desirable.  Screening assay development  An ELISA-based assay that successfully measured neutralization of rotavirus infectivity has been reported [11] . Similarly, we adapted an immunofluorescent (IF) infectivity assay to a moderate-throughput screening (MTS) format to measure changes in rotavirus infectivity following treatment of cells with compounds from a natural product library. In the standard IF assay, MA104 cells are cultured to confluence in 96-well microtiter plates, then infected with rotavirus in triplicate wells and incubated for 18-20 hours. Virus replication then is detected by indirect IF and replication is quantified by counting fluorescent focus forming units (FFU) in a dilution series by fluorescence microscopy. To adapt the assay to an MTS format that would necessarily eliminate manual counting of FFU, an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was used in place of the FITC-conjugated antibody, and the assay was developed with chemiluminescent substrate. Virus replication then was quantified in a microplate fluorometer with readout of relative light units (rlu). Use of an enzymatic signal to measure infectivity was validated by comparing changes in chemiluminescent signal versus virus dose measured by IF. The data shown in figure 1 illustrate the range of increase in chemiluminescent signal that corresponds with increasing infectious units in a 10 -1/3 virus dilution series. These data demonstrate that changes in the magnitude of the enzymatic signal accurately reflect changes in the number of infectious units measured by IF.Luminescent signal magnitude corresponds with infectious units Figure 1 Luminescent signal magnitude corresponds with infectious units. Cells were infected with 10 -1/3 serial dilutions of rotavirus for 18 hours. Plates were fixed and probed with anti-VP6 mAb A6M followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Signals were developed with chemiluminescent substrate and measured on a ThermoElectron Fluroskan and scored as relative light units (rlu). Error bars are standard errors of the means (n = 5). In order to establish internal inhibition controls for the assay, we measured reductions in infectivity in response to cytokines known to induce antiviral gene expression. Cells were pre-treated with IFNα, IFNγ, or a combination of both cytokines. IFNα and IFNγ both reduced infectivity, and the magnitude of reduction increased to ~80% when cells were treated with the combination of both cytokines ( Figure 2 ). The combination of IFNα and IFNγ consistently yielded the greatest reduction in virus replication. Therefore, this mixture of cytokines, and IL-2 which is not known to have direct antiviral activity, were included as internal positive and negative controls, respectively, in each plate of every experiment.  Assay validation  Plate uniformity assessments were performed according to the recommendations of the NIH Chemical Genomics Center in order to determine whether our assay was suitable for eventual adaptation to a high-throughput format. The Z' coefficient was established with mock infected cells representing the minimum signal value, virus infected cells representing the maximum signal value, and the IFNα/IFNγ mixture as the midrange signal. Experiments consisting of three plates each run on three consecutive days were performed and an example of the data from one day is shown in Figure 3 . No evidence of significant drift or edge effect was observed. The Z' coefficient measures the quality of an HTS assay by comparing data variation and the signal dynamic range, and a value of > 0.5 establishes the assay as excellent for screening [12, 13] . The Z' values ranged from 0.69 -0.82 for individual plates, and the aggregate Z' value from all plates and all days was 0.64. A signal-to-noise value of 4.96 was calculated with the aggregate data from all plates. All of the statistical criteria for intra-plate assessment were met [14] .The assay results show some inter-plate variability. For example, although all within-day fold-shifts in signal were less than 2, all average (between)-day fold-shifts were not. We expect some degree of variability due simply to the variations in the growth status of cells from day to day. Importantly, we established sufficient intra-plate controls to account for minor variances associated with cell status.Together the validation and statistical data support the assay as a viable platform for screening compound libraries.  Compounds from a natural product library reduce rotavirus infectivity  A 280 compound natural product library was screened to identify compounds that reduced rotavirus infectivity. Forty-seven (17%) compounds were selected for a second round of screening and were tested both for dose-dependency and for effects on cell viability. A representative dataset is shown in Figure 4 . Figure 4A shows data obtained from the initial screen, and the data in figure 4B illustrate dose-dependent reductions in rotavirus infectivity in response to treatment of cells with each of the four representative compounds. The observed reduction in infectivity was not a result of generalized cytotoxicity because cell viability did not decrease upon treatment beyond the DMSO only controls ( Figure 4B ). The one exception was that mangostin was toxic at 10 μg/ml. Dose-dependency and cell viability assays were performed in parallel with cells seeded at the same densities from the same cell suspension.Forty-seven compounds from the primary screen were subjected to second round screening and 32 were eliminated from consideration for follow-up studies. Ten compounds did not reduce infectivity above the established threshold in the second round, generating a true false positive hit rate of ~20%. Twenty compounds proved cytotoxic as measured by the cell viability assay, and two compounds are known toxins with gross effects on cell metabolism (e.g. protein synthesis inhibitors). The two toxins were eliminated from further consideration because we are interested in identifying compounds that stimulate or enhance antiviral signaling pathways. The remaining 15 compounds were designated true hits (5 %) and are listed in Table 1 .   Time course of inhibitory effects  The four compounds shown as representative data in Figure 4 were analyzed further because of prior reports of their effects on components of innate immune signaling pathways [15] [16] [17] . A time-course and dose-response of each compound were established in the immunofluorescent focus reduction assay. Cells were treated with each compound for various times ranging from 12 hours preinfection to 2 hours post-infection ( Figure 5 ). Significant levels of inhibition of virus replication were observed with each compound when added as early as 2 hours prior to infection. The level of inhibition did not change dramatically as pre-treatment times increased up to 12 hours. All compounds showed some ability to reduce infectivity when added at the time of infection, and 18-β glycyrrhetinic acid, all-trans retinoic acid and mangostin were somewhat effective when added at 1 or 2 hours post-infection. Interestingly, addition of abietic acid post-infection showed a small, but significant increase in infectivity that also was dose-dependent.  α-mangostin and 18 β-glycyrrhetinic acid activate NFκB and induce IL-8 secretion  The design of our assay measures inhibition of rotavirus replication but does not distinguish whether antiviral signaling pathways are activated or whether the compounds block specific steps of the virus replication cycle. To test the hypothesis that virus replication was reduced because cell signaling pathways involved in antiviral and inflammatory gene expression were induced by selected compound treatment, NFκB activation and IL-8 secretion was measured following each treatment. α-mangostin and 18 β-glycyrrhetinic acid induced NFκB activation, whereas all-trans retinoic acid and abietic acid did not beyond the levels of the control ( Figure 6 ). The levels of IL-8 expres- sion measured for each compound were consistent with levels of activation of NFκB (Figure 7 ).  Discussion  We designed a MTS assay capable of identifying compounds that reduce rotavirus infectivity, toward a longterm goal of discovering compounds that activate innate immune signaling pathways to reduce the disease impact of acute viral infections. We screened a library consisting of 280 natural products purified from plant extracts, and several compounds were identified that reproducibly inhibited rotavirus replication without cytotoxicity. The assay has been validated statistically, as well as by the observation that compounds selected for further study were purchased from different sources and showed reproducible inhibition of virus replication. In addition, follow-up assays measured reductions in infectivity in response to compound treatment in the standard rotavirus IF assay and the degrees of replication inhibition and dose-dependence correlated with the values obtained in NFκB activation in infected and uninfected cells in the presence of selected compounds the MTS assay. We calculated a true hit rate for the natural product library of 5% and a false positive rate of ~20%. We performed numerous optimization assays to reduce variability presented by variation in growth properties of our cell line. We also have initiated a screen of a 10,000 compound synthetic chemical library, and after screening 2500 compounds, our true hit rate is 1.8% (data not shown). These true hit percentages yield a large, but not prohibitive, number of compounds for follow-up studies both in vitro and in animal models. Together the data suggest our assay is an effective platform for screening candidate compounds for antiviral activity in adherent epithelial cells.  18--Glycyrrhetinic  In this study, we sought to identify compounds with innate immune modulating effects that resulted in cellular resistance to rotavirus infection. The format of the assay, that is, readout of reduction in infectivity, does not distinguish between compounds that act on antiviral signaling pathways and those that may target specific steps in the virus replication cycle, such as entry or replicase activity. However, two of the four compounds selected for follow-up study activated NFκB and induced IL-8 secretion. Moreover, the majority of compounds called a hit in the screen for which data is available has been previously described to affect inflammatory or anti-inflammatory gene expression or pathogen growth in vitro (Table 1) . These observations strongly support the assertion that our assay is appropriate, but not exclusive, for discovery of immune potentiators, as we intended.There has been a resurgence of interest in natural products as drug candidates for a variety of reasons including increased interest in infectious disease prevention and therapy, a lower percentage of chemical properties that negatively affect permeation and absorption, and the propensity of natural products to act by affecting protein-protein interactions [18] . Important for the studies described here, natural products are known to modulate immune responses and cell signaling pathways. Table 1 lists compounds designated hits in this study, along with some of the reported functions. Compounds were grouped into those chosen for further study (Group A), and those known to stimulate or repress inflammatory responses or innate immune signaling pathways and two with unknown functions (Group B). Also included in Group B are compounds with reported antiviral, antibacterial, or anti-protozoan activity. We have not yet deciphered mechanisms by which these compounds inhibit rotavirus replication in vitro. However, the fact that several of the compounds, for example, abietic acid, genistein, and capsaicin, interfere with NFκB activation and cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX2) expression is noteworthy (see Table 1 for references). NFκB activation is an important regulator of COX2 expression; COX2 activity and COX-mediated prostaglandin synthesis is necessary for rotavirus infectivity in CaCo-2 intestinal cells [19] . Interestingly, the addition of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) restored infectivity reduced by the COX inhibitor [19] and three of the compounds we chose for follow-up studies all have an inhibitory effect on either synthesis or release of PGE 2 (see Table 1 references). The ability of α-mangostin and 18 β-glycyrrhetinic acid to inhibit rotavirus replication when both compounds activate NFκB is most likely because antiviral states are established upon treatment of the cells with each compound prior to infection. The definitive mechanisms by which the compounds identified in this natural product library screen warrant further investigation.We intend this MTS assay to serve as a platform for discovery of candidate adjuvants that will be effective against acute viral infections at mucosal surfaces. Rotavirus is an ideal model system for these purposes for several reasons. First, rotaviruses cause gastrointestinal illness in most mammalian species and so their relevance as mucosal pathogens is clear. Second, these viruses are well characterized with respect to structure, antigenicity, and mechanisms of virus replication, and thus an excellent resource for mechanistic follow-up studies is available. Third, rotavirus is promiscuous in its tropism for cultured cell lines, and multiple cell lines of different types and species of origin, including primary cell lines [20] , support productive Finally, the fact that rotavirus employs a mechanism to down-regulate antiviral gene expression allows consideration of possible evasion strategies when selecting and testing candidate immune potentiators [21, 22] . Current development efforts include expansion of screening studies to other lytic RNA viruses such as influenza virus, and adaptation of the assay to a fully automated format.  Cells, virus, and rotavirus monoclonal antibodies  MA104 monkey kidney epithelial cells were maintained in M199 medium (MediaTech Cell Grow) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals). Isolation and cultivation of G serotype 6 (G6) bovine rotavirus strain NCDV has been described [23] . Monoclonal antibody (MAb) E4 reacts with major structural protein VP6 of most group A rotavirus strains [24] . MAb A6M recognizes VP6 and was generated by immunizing mice with G6 bovine rotavirus strain B641 and screening hybridoma supernatants for antibodies that react with rotavirus specific proteins.  Reagents and chemicals  A library containing 0.5 mg each of 280 natural products purified from plant extracts was purchased from TimTec (TimTec Corporation). Compounds were reconstituted in 500 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the library was stored at -80°C. Individual compounds α-mangostin (TimTec or Indofine), 18-β-glycyrrhetinic acid (18-BGA; Fluka), abietic acid (AA; Sigma), and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA; Sigma) were reconstituted in DMSO to final stock concentrations of 25 mg/ml.  Recombinant human interferon-α (IFN-α; BioSource  International, Inc) was diluted to a concentration of 1 × 10 5 U/ml in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Recombinant human interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2; Peprotech Inc) were diluted to 2 × 10 6 U/ml and 10 μg/ml, respectively, in PBS.Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (H+L), HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) F(ab') 2 fragments, and FITC-conjugated goat antimouse IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories.  Screening assay Compound treatments and virus infections  Working stock solutions of each compound from the library were prepared to twice the desired final concentrations of 20 μg/ml, 10 μg/ml, and 2 μg/ml in serum-free M199. Working stock solutions of assay controls consisted of 2%, 1% DMSO, and 0.2% DMSO, a mixture of 200 U/ml each of IFN-α and IFN-γ, and 2 ng/ml of IL-2.MA104 cells were cultured to confluence in 96-well blackwalled plates (Costar). The culture media was decanted and replaced with 50 μl of M199. 50 μl of 2X control and experimental stock solutions were added to respective wells, in triplicate, and plates were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C. Following the 4 hour incubation, the contents of each plate were removed and 8.9 × 10 5 ffu/well of trypsinactivated NCDV in 0% M199 was added to appropriate wells. Mock infected wells received 50 μl of 0% M199. 50 μl of fresh 2X control and experimental compounds were added and at 18 hours post-infection, the cells were fixed for 10 minutes with 80% acetone.  Cell-based ELISA  The wells were blocked for one hour at room temperature with 100 μl of PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v) and 0.05% Tween-20. The plates were washed one time with 400 μl of wash buffer consisting of PBS and 0.05% Tween 20. 50 μl of 20 μg/ml A6M or E4 (1:25 hybridoma supernatant) in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.5% dry milk was added to the wells and incubated for one hour at room temperature. The plates were washed four times with wash buffer, then 50 μl of a 1:500 dilution of HRP-conjugated F(ab') 2 in 0.5% Blotto was added and the plates were incubated for one hour at room temperature. Following a final wash, 100 μl of BM Chemiluminescence ELISA Substrate (Roche Diagnostics) was added and reactions were allowed to proceed for 4 minutes to reach a steady state of enzymatic activity. Signals were measured on a ThermoElectron Fluroskan (Thermo-Electron Cooperation) with an integration time of 1,000 ms.  Cell viability assay  Cell viability assays for compound toxicity were set up similar to compound screening except cells were not infected over the course of the experiments. Cell viability was measured with the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer.  Statistics and criteria for "hit" designation  Compounds that showed a greater than 60% decrease in signal at 5 μg/ml when compared to the 0.5% DMSO control, and p < 0.05 as determined by a one-tailed student's t test, were selected for secondary screening. Additionally, compounds that showed a greater than 90% decrease in signal when compared to the 1% DMSO control and p < 0.05 also were selected for further screening. Compounds that showed a greater than 10% decrease in signal and a p < 0.05 in the cell viability assay were determined to be toxic.  Plate uniformity assessment  The recommendations of the National Institutes of Health Chemical Genomics Center's Assay Guidance Manual Version 4.1 for plate uniformity assessments were followed.Three separate experiments consisting of three plates each were performed on three different days. Confluent MA104 cells were pretreated for 4 hours with 100 μl of either media or a mixture of 100 U/ml each of IFN-α and IFN-γ. All media was serum free and contained 1% DMSO.The pre-treatment media was decanted and the cells were infected with 50 μl of 8.9 × 10 5 pfu/ml of trypsin-activated NCDV. Mock infected wells were treated with 50 μl of serum free media. 50 μl of fresh 2X treatment media containing 2% DMSO was added to the respective wells and the plates were incubated for 18 hours. The plates were fixed, labeled and quantified according to the assay procedure described above. All calculations were performed using the Assay Guidance Manual's spreadsheet [14] .  Immunofluorescent focus assay  Immunofluorescent assays (IF) for rotavirus infectivity were performed as previously described [24] . Cells were cultured in 96-well plates and were mock infected or infected with NCDV at approximately 150 ffu/well. Preor post-treatment with compounds was performed for the indicated times as described above. 18 hours post-infection, the cells were fixed for 10 minutes with 80% acetone. Incubations with primary and secondary antibody were as described above, except the secondary antibody was FITCconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Fluorescent foci were counted by microscopy (Nikon Eclipse TE300).  NFκB and IL-8 assays  MA104 cells in 100 × 20 mm culture dishes were treated with 7.5 μg/ml of selected compounds in serum-free M199 containing 0.03% DMSO. The effects of the presence of virus on NFκB activation and IL-8 secretion in the assays was tested by infecting cells with trypsin-activated NCDV at an moi of 10 pfu/cell at the time of compound treatment. In all cases, incubation periods were 6 hours.NF-κB activation was quantified with TransAM NF-κB p50 Transcription Factor Assay Kit (Active Motif). Nuclear extracts were prepared with CelLytic NuCLEAR Extraction Kit (Sigma) following the manufacturer's protocol. Nuclear protein concentration was determined with the D c Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and 20 μg of nuclear protein was used in the assay. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by two-factor ANOVA.IL-8 secretion was measured with the Quantikine Human IL-8 system (R & D Systems) following the manufacturer's protocol. Compound treatments and infections were performed as described above, except that the incubation periods were extended to 24 hours. The data were analyzed by student's t test with a threshold of significance set to p < 0.001.  			1		1			
7623845	Structural analysis of TRAS1, a novel family of telomeric repeat-associated retrotransposons in the silkworm, Bombyx mori.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC230694/	We characterized TRAS1, a retrotransposable element which was inserted into the telomeric repetitive sequence (CCTAA)n of the silkworm, Bombyx mori. The complete sequence of TRAS1, a stretch of 7.8 kb with a poly(A) tract at the 3' end, was determined. No long terminal repeat (LTR) was found at the termini of the element. TRAS1 contains gag- and pol-like open reading frames (ORFs) which are similar to those of non-LTR retrotransposons. The two ORFs overlap but are one nucleotide out of frame (+1 frameshift). Most of the approximately 250 copies of TRAS1 elements in the genome were highly conserved in the structure. Chromosomal in situ hybridization showed that TRAS1 elements are clustered at the telomeres of Bombyx chromosomes. A phylogenetic analysis using the amino acid sequence of the reverse transcriptase domain within the pol-like ORF revealed that TRAS1 falls into one lineage with R1, which is a family of non-LTR retrotransposons inserted into the same site within the 28S ribosomal DNA unit in most insects. TRAS1 may have been derived from R1 and changed the target specificity so that TRAS1 inserts into the telomeric repetitive sequence (CCTAA)n. Southern hybridization and Bal 31 exonuclease analyses showed that TRAS1 elements are clustered proximal to the terminal long tract of (CCTAA)n. TRAS1 is a novel family of non-LTR retrotransposons which are inserted into the telomeric repetitive sequences as target sites.						1			
7520090	Localization of neutralizing epitopes and the receptor-binding site within the amino-terminal 330 amino acids of the murine coronavirus spike protein.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC236940/	To localize the epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the S1 subunit of the murine coronavirus JHMV spike protein, we have expressed S1 proteins with different deletions from the C terminus of S1. S1utt is composed of the entire 769-amino-acid (aa) S1 protein; S1NM, S1N, S1n(330), and S1n(220) are deletion mutants with 594, 453, 330, and 220 aa from the N terminus of the S1 protein. The expressed S1 deletion mutant proteins were examined for reactivities to a panel of MAbs. All MAbs classified in groups A and B, those reactive to most mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains and those specific for isolate JHMV, respectively, recognized S1N(330) and the larger S1 deletion mutants but failed to react with S1N(220). MAbs in group C, specific for the larger S protein of JHMV, reacted only with the S1utt protein without any deletion. These results indicated that the domain composed of the N-terminal 330 aa comprised the cluster of conformational epitopes recognized by MAbs in groups A and B. It was also shown that the epitopes of MAbs in group C were not restricted to the region missing in the smaller S protein. These results together with the fact that all MAbs in group B retained high neutralizing activity suggested the possibility that the N-terminal 330 aa are responsible for binding to the MHV-specific receptors. In investigate this possibility, we expressed the receptor protein and examined the binding of each S1 deletion mutant to the receptor. It was demonstrated that the S1N(330) protein as well as other S1 deletion mutants larger than S1N(330) bound to the receptor. These results indicated that a domain composed of 330 aa at the N terminus of the S1 protein is responsible for binding to the MHV-specific receptor.						1			
7684461	Definition of a subset of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells that are permissive to human cytomegalovirus infection.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC237655/	The identity of cells responsible for transmission of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in blood products or bone marrow transplants is unknown. We have tested the capacity of HCMV to in vitro infect human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors and found that certain PBMC are permissive to HCMV infection. In vitro-infected viable cells were double stained for surface expression of different HMCV proteins and for cell-type-specific antigens to allow the identification of sensitive cells. All analysis were performed on viable cells, using HCMV-specific monoclonal antibodies and automated flow cytofluorimetry. PBMC were infected either with the laboratory-adapted HCMV strain AD169 or with a virus isolate obtained from a viremic patient. Up to 25% of all PBMC could express the major immediate-early antigen as well as the pp65 antigen, known at the lower matrix protein. Infected cells were mainly CD14+ monocytes, but also a small population of large CD8+ cells were susceptible to HCMV infection. CD19+ B lymphocytes were resistant to HCMV infection. Different populations of infected cells were enriched by using Dynabeads coated with cell-type-specific antibodies, and the presence of infectious virus was demonstrated by incubating the selected and sonicated cell material on human fibroblasts. Only material from infected monocytes and from CD3+ CD8+ cells gave rise to HCMV-specific plaques. The presence of HCMV mRNA as a sign of active viral transcription of the major immediate-early and late pp150 genes in infected cells was demonstrated by using nested reversed polymerase chain reaction. A common denominator was found for all cells that could be infected with HCMV. The CD13 antigen, a 130- to 150-kDa integral membrane protein identical to the enzyme aminopeptidase N, was expressed on all HCMV-permissive cells.						1			
2164599	Purification of the 110-kilodalton glycoprotein receptor for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 from mouse liver and identification of a nonfunctional, homologous protein in MHV-resistant SJL/J mice.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC249677/	The receptor for mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) is a 110- to 120-kilodalton (kDa) glycoprotein which is expressed in MHV-susceptible mouse strains on the membranes of hepatocytes, intestinal epithelial cells, and macrophages. SJL/J mice, which are highly resistant to MHV-A59, were previously shown to lack detectable levels of receptor by using either solid-phase virus receptor assays or binding of a monoclonal anti-receptor antibody (MAb) which blocks infection of MHV-susceptible mouse cells. This MAb was used for affinity purification of the receptor glycoprotein from livers of MHV-susceptible Swiss Webster mice. The MHV receptor and an antigenically related protein of 48 to 58 kDa were copurified and then separated by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The first 15 amino acids of the receptor were sequenced, and a synthetic peptide of this amino acid sequence was prepared. Rabbit antiserum made against this peptide bound to the MHV receptor glycoprotein and the 48- to 58-kDa protein from livers of MHV-susceptible BALB/c mice and Swiss Webster mice and from the intestinal brush border of BALB/c mice. In immunoblots of intestinal brush border and hepatocyte membranes of MHV-resistant SJL/J mice, the antibody against the amino terminus of the receptor identified proteins that are 5 to 10 kDa smaller than the MHV receptor and the 48- to 58-kDa related protein from Swiss Webster or BALB/c mice. Thus, SJL/J mice express a protein which shares some sequence homology with the MHV receptor but which lacks virus-binding activity and is not recognized by the blocking anti-receptor MAb. These results suggest that resistance of SJL/J mice to MHV-A59 may be due to absence or mutation of the virus-binding domain in the nonfunctional receptor homolog in SJL/J mice.						1			
18542898	Treatment with proteasome inhibitor bortezomib enhances antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity induced by DNA vaccination	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2535907/	There is an urgent need to develop new innovative therapies for the control of cancer. Antigen-specific immunotherapy and the employment of proteasome inhibitors have emerged as two potentially plausible approaches for the control of cancer. In the current study, we explored the combination of the DNA vaccine encoding calreticulin (CRT) linked to human papillomavirus type 16 E7 antigen (CRT/E7) with the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, for their ability to generate E7-specific immune responses and antitumor effects in vaccinated mice. We found that the combination of treatment with bortezomib and CRT/E7(detox) DNA generated more potent E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses and better therapeutic effects against TC-1 tumors in tumor-bearing mice compared to monotherapy. Furthermore, we found that treatment with bortezomib led to increased apoptosis of TC-1 tumor cells and could render the TC-1 tumor cells more susceptible to lysis by E7-specific CD8+ T cells. Our data have significant implications for future clinical translation.

3973963	Differential susceptibility of cultured neural cells to the human coronavirus OC43.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC254747/	By using cell-type-specific markers and neural cultures derived from various areas of the nervous system, it has been possible to identify various interactions between OC43 virus and mouse oligodendrocytes, neurons, astrocytes, and fibroblasts. Neurons derived from dorsal root ganglia produced viral antigen and infectious virus. Astrocytes and fibroblasts both produced viral antigen but not infectious virus. Oligodendrocytes produced neither infectious virus nor viral antigen. Human embryo brain cells, including astrocytes, were susceptible to OC43 infection but did not produce infectious virus.					1	1			
17242832	Spatial dynamics of an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome in an urban area.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627565/	OBJECTIVE: To map risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in an urban area and assess the ability of traditional interventions to control dispersion of the disease. METHODS: Data on the Beijing SARS epidemic were used to map spatial clusters of identified contacts and to estimate transmission of SARS using a model with a time-dependent transmission rate. RESULTS: The estimated transmission rate decreased dramatically from 20 to 30 April 2003. The total number of cases in the epidemic in Beijing was estimated to be 2521. Hierarchical clustering revealed that risk-exposures were widespread, but clustered in a pattern that is distinctly related to the Beijing urban ring roads. CONCLUSION: Traditional control measures can be very effective at reducing transmission of SARS. Spatial patterns of risk-exposures can inform disease surveillance, prediction and control by identifying spatial target areas on which interventions should be focused.							1	1	
20082709	An M2e-based multiple antigenic peptide vaccine protects mice from lethal challenge with divergent H5N1 influenza viruses	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2823673/	BACKGROUND: A growing concern has raised regarding the pandemic potential of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop an effective and safe vaccine against the divergent H5N1 influenza viruses. In the present study, we designed a tetra-branched multiple antigenic peptide (MAP)-based vaccine, designated M2e-MAP, which contains the sequence overlapping the highly conserved extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) of a HPAI H5N1 virus, and investigated its immune responses and cross-protection against different clades of H5N1 viruses. RESULTS: Our results showed that M2e-MAP vaccine induced strong M2e-specific IgG antibody responses following 3-dose immunization of mice with M2e-MAP in the presence of Freunds' or aluminium (alum) adjuvant. M2e-MAP vaccination limited viral replication and attenuated histopathological damage in the challenged mouse lungs. The M2e-MAP-based vaccine protected immunized mice against both clade1: VN/1194 and clade2.3.4: SZ/406H H5N1 virus challenge, being able to counteract weight lost and elevate survival rate following lethal challenge of H5N1 viruses. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that M2e-MAP presenting M2e of H5N1 virus has a great potential to be developed into an effective subunit vaccine for the prevention of infection by a broad spectrum of HPAI H5N1 viruses.	Background  The re-emergence of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in 2003 has caused 262 fatal cases among a total of 442 infected individuals [1] . Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop safe and effective antiviral strategies for the prevention of any future pandemic of H5N1 HPAI [2, 3] , among which vaccination is still the most effective means to prevent influenza A virus infection. Due to current vaccine technologies facing annual problems with vaccine-strain matching, some conserved antigens of influenza A virus become promising target for the development of influenza vaccines with broad cross-protection.In comparison with other surface proteins of H5N1 viruses, matrix protein 2 (M2) is the most conserved. The native M2 protein exists as a homotetramer formed by two disulfide linked dimers, with each monomer consisting of 97 amino acids [4, 5] . The 24-amino-acid extracellular domain of M2 protein (M2e) is remarkably conserved across influenza A subtypes [6] . Passively transferred anti-M2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) accelerated lung viral clearance [7] , and mAbs recognizing the N-terminus highly conserved epitope in M2e protected mice from lethal influenza A virus challenge [8] , implying that M2, in particular M2e, may serve as an attractive vaccine target. Currently, the rapid evolution of H5N1 virus and the co-circulation of multiple antigenic variants in multiple regions determine that development of H5N1 vaccine with cross-protection against divergent H5N1 viruses would be inevitable. Although a number of M2e-based vaccines have been reported to provide broad-spectrum protection against ordinary human influenza virus infection [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , the cross-protective effect to divergent H5N1 viruses was undocumented.In the present study, we designed and synthesized a tetra-branched multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) derived from the M2e sequence of H5N1 virus VN/1194 strain, denoted as M2e-MAP, with an aim to develop a M2e-based vaccine for induction of M2e-specific immune responses and cross-protection of the vaccinated animals against lethal challenge of divergent H5N1 virus strains.  M2e-MAP immunization induced potent M2e-specific antibody responses  To evaluate humoral immune responses potentially induced by M2e-MAP, mice were vaccinated with 10 μg of M2e-MAP plus Freund's or aluminium (alum) adjuvant as described in Methods, and M2e-specific IgG antibodies were detected in mouse serum samples by ELISA. As shown in Figure 1 , M2e-MAP induced strong M2e-specific IgG antibody responses, with the highest titer reaching 1:10 5 and 1:10 4 for M2e-MAP+FCA/FIA and M2e-MAP+alum, respectively, at 10 days post last boost vaccination. In contrast, only background level of antibody responses was detected in the mice receiving adjuvant alone.  M2e-MAP vaccination limited viral replication and attenuated virus-induced lung pathology  Two phylogenetically distinguished H5N1 virus isolates, clade1: VN/1194 and clade2.3.4: SZ/406H were selected to evaluate the protective immunity afforded by M2e-MAP vaccine in vivo. Two weeks after the last boost, mice were challenged with 10 LD 50 of H5N1 virus VN/ 1194 or SZ/406H. Five days post-challenge, lungs were removed from infected mice, and infectious virus titers in the lung tissues were measured to determine the protective effects of M2e-MAP vaccine on viral clearance. Compared with those from the adjuvant control (FCA/ FIA or alum), the virus titers in the lungs of M2e-MAP vaccinated mice were significantly lower after H5N1 virus challenge (P < 0.0001) (Figure 2 ), suggesting that M2e-MAP vaccine can induce protective immunity against viral replication in vaccinated mice.Further examination of the lung tissues of virus-challenged mice revealed dramatic histopathological damage in the pulmonary airways and parenchymal tissues in the adjuvant group, including severe damage of bronchial epithelium with necrosis and desquamation, pulmonary vascular dilatation and congestion, infiltration of prominent number of lymphocytes accompanied by exudates and severe edema, especially around vessels, as well as broadening interstitial spaces or fused alveoli walls with focal hemorrhage ( Figure 3A ). In contrast, lungs of M2e-MAP-vaccinated mice exhibited less Figure 1 M2e-specific antibody responses induced by M2e-MAP vaccine. Mice were vaccinated with M2e-MAP plus FCA/FIA (s.c.) or alum (i. m.) adjuvant for a total of 3 times. Mice receiving FCA/FIA or alum alone were served as adjuvant controls. Mouse sera were collected preimmunization and 10 days post-each immunization for detection of M2e-specific antibodies by ELISA. The end-point titer of each sample was determined as the highest dilution that yielded an OD 450 nm value greater than twice that of similarly diluted serum sample collected prevaccination. The data are expressed as geometric mean titer (GMT) ± standard deviation (SD) of 10 mice per group. The lower limit detection (1:10) is indicated by a dotted line. Experiments were repeated three times. histopathological changes, accompanied by only mild pulmonary interstitial pneumonia and moderate lymphocytic infiltration ( Figure 3B ). The above data implied that M2e-MAP vaccination may protect the mice against lethal challenge of divergent H5N1 viruses through a combination of limiting viral replication in the lungs and attenuating virus-induced lung pathology.  M2e-MAP vaccination elicited cross-protection against lethal challenge of divergent H5N1 viruses  After receiving the lethal dose (10 LD 50 ) of two H5N1 virus strains, the M2e-MAP vaccinated mice were further evaluated in terms of cross-protective ability by daily observation of the clinical symptoms, including weight loss and survival rate for two weeks, and then histopathological examination following removal of lung tissues.From day 4 after VN/1194 and day 3 after SZ/406H virus infection, the adjuvant control mice (FCA/FIA or alum) developed obvious clinical signs, including ruffled fur, hunched posture, rapid breathing, inactivity and paralysis of posterior limb. These clinical signs were either not observed or were delayed for 2-3 days in the M2e-MAP vaccination group. Most M2e-MAP vaccinated mice with clinical signs only exhibited slight or partial piloerection for 2-3 days and then recovered. Moreover, compared to the adjuvant control, M2e-MAP vaccinated mice that did not survive the challenges were observed to have delayed the onset of illness and longer survival days. The observed protection against clinical signs correlated with the changes in body weight. In the adjuvant group, body weight dramatically decreased and even reached a near 25% severe weight loss after H5N1 virus infection. In contrast, the average body weight in the M2e-MAP vaccination group only slightly decreased (less than 10%) during 6-10 days after challenge and then steadily increased ( Figure 4A ).All control mice receiving FCA/FIA or alum adjuvant alone died from virus challenge, while 70% to 80% of the mice vaccinated with M2e-MAP survived the lethal H5N1 virus challenge ( Figure 4B ), with significantly increased survival rate (P < 0.0001). At 14 days postchallenge, lung tissues from surviving mice were removed to evaluate viral replication and histopathological damage. No H5N1 virus was detected in the lungs of surviving mice, and the lung tissues of these mice presented almost normal structures (data not shown). The above data confirmed that M2e-MAP vaccine can afford cross-protection against lethal challenge of divergent H5N1 viruses.  Discussion  A cross-protective vaccine for antigenic variants of H5N1 virus is a very important component in prophylactic strategy against a possible human pandemic. , and lungs were collected for detection of virus titer five days later. The data are expressed as Log 10 TCID 50 /g of lung tissues. The lower limit of detection is 1.5 Log 10 TCID 50 /g of tissues as indicated by a dotted line. The data are presented as GMT ± SD of 5 mice per group. * indicates P < 0.0001 compared to the FCA/FIA control group; ** means P < 0.0001 compared to the alum control group. Experiments were repeated three times.Although the highly conservative M2e of influenza A virus is one of the most promising target for development of universal influenza vaccines, some strategies would be required to improve immunogenicity of vaccines based on M2e containing only 24 amino acid.The high molar ratio and dense packing of multiple copies of a target antigen in MAP system have been shown to stimulate better immune responses than single-chain peptides [14] [15] [16] . Mozdzanowska et al. [17] reported that MAP system presenting human influenza M2e sequence was an effective immunogen, with anti-M2e IgG antibodies from mice immunized with M2e-MAP binding specifically to M2-expressing cells. However, it is unclear whether M2e-MAP could be used as a vaccine candidate to provide effective protection against HPAI H5N1 virus. Different from human influenza A viruses of H1, H2 or H3, H5N1 viruses have circulated only in domestic and wild birds so far [18] [19] [20] [21] . The H5N1 viruses leading to human infections still belong to the avian type [22] . M2e vaccine designed on sequences of human influenza virus H1, H2 or H3 subtype may not provide the same protection against H5N1 virus leading to human infections [11] . Moreover, the 10-20 amino acid region of M2e was consistent with host restriction specificities [23] .In this study, we designed M2e-MAP in tetrabranched form containing 4 copies of sequence overlapping M2e of VN/1194, a HPAI H5N1 strain ( Figure 5 ). High titers of M2e-specific antibody responses could be induced following immunization of M2e-MAP plus Freund's adjuvant, a commonly used adjuvant in animal experiments or alum, a common adjuvant for human vaccines (Figure 1 ). Although it has been shown that M2e-specific IgG antibodies do not exhibit an ability to directly neutralize virus in vitro, the antiviral effect of M2e-based vaccines was mediated by antibodies to M2e antigen. The mechanism of such antibody mediated antiviral effect could be due to antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or complementmediated cytotoxicity (CDC) [24, 25] . Therefore, the induction of M2e-specific antibody responses was necessary for M2e-based vaccines in the prevention of H5N1 virus infection.Strikingly, M2e-MAP vaccination with Freund's and alum adjuvants conferred cross-protection against a lethal challenge with not only the homologous strain, VN/1194 in clade1, but also a divergent strain, SZ/406H in clade2.3.4. M2e-MAP vaccination in mice delayed the onset of illness, prolonged survival, alleviated body weight loss, limited viral replication and restricted histopathological damage in lung tissues (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 ). The clade categorization of the VN/1194 and SZ/406H strains was based on the phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene. The clade2.3.4 viruses seem to have been prevalent in China since late 2005 and were also responsible for human infection in Laos, Malaysia and Vietnam [26, 27] , which included A/Hunan/2/2009, one of the most recent human isolates from China [28] .Compared with the monomeric M2e peptide-based vaccines, M2e-MAP vaccine could induce stronger protective immunity due to the immune enhancing effect of the T-helper epitope in the vaccine [14] . In terms of the safety, the synthetic peptide-based M2e-MAP vaccine is superior to the DNA-, adenoviral vector-, and recombinant protein-based M2 vaccines. For example, DNA vaccines have the potential to integrate the viral genomes into human DNA, to develop autoimmunity, and to induce antibiotic resistance [29] . The recombinant protein-based vaccine may have contamination of endotoxin and other unwanted antigens from cell cultures [30] . In spite of a relatively higher cost of production, synthetic peptide-based vaccine can be rapidly designed and synthesized and more convenient for storage and transportation, making M2e-MAP vaccine a better choice for speed development of effective and safe vaccines to combat emerging influenza pandemic.Based on the evidence of our findings, the approach of developing M2e-based vaccines with broad cross-protection is feasible. Some strategies, such as incorporation of appropriate adjuvants into the present MAP system, modification of the present M2e consensus sequences of H5N1 viruses as vaccine target, and/or selection of other M2e expression forms, might be helpful to achieve full cross-protection against lethal H5N1 virus infection. The effects of such approaches need to be determined in further studies. The data reported here support the concept of developing an M2e-based vaccine candidate that could provide cross-protection against divergent HPAI H5N1 viruses. Such vaccine based on the highly conserved target antigen of H5N1 viruses might be used in combination with current H5N1 influenza vaccines to enhance protection and to prevent a possible future human pandemic of H5N1 influenza.  Conclusions  In the present study, we synthesized tetra-branched M2e-MAP based on the M2e sequence of H5N1 virus. The M2e-MAP vaccine induced strong M2e-specific IgG antibody responses, being able to protect mice against lethal challenge of both clade1: VN/1194 and clade2.3.4: SZ/406H H5N1 viruses. Based on the evidence of our findings, the approach of developing M2ebased vaccine with broad cross-protection is feasible. The data reported here support the concept of Figure 5 shows the composition and sequence of M2e-MAP.  Mice  Female BALB/c mice at 4-6 weeks were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Unit and housed in the animal facility of The University of Hong Kong following the approved animal care protocols. Mice were rested for 2 weeks before immunization. The animal study was approved by the Department of Health of Government of Hong Kong Special Administration Region, and University Animal Ethics Committee of The University of Hong Kong.  Viruses  HPAI H5N1 virus isolates used in this study were clade1: VN/1194 and clade2.3.4: SZ/406H. H5N1 viruses were grown in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Virus-containing allantoic fluid was harvested and stored in aliquots at -80°C until use. The LD 50 of each virus stain was determined in mice after serial dilutions of the virus stock. All infectious experiments related to H5N1 viruses were performed in an approved biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility at The University of Hong Kong.  Animal experiment  Mice were subcutaneously (s.c.) prime vaccinated with M2e-MAP (10 μg/mouse) plus Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA, sigma) and boosted twice with the same amount of immunogen plus Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA, Sigma) at 3-week intervals. For parallel experiments, mice were also intramuscularly (i.m.) vaccinated with the same amount of M2e-MAP immunogens plus alum adjuvant (Sigma) at the same condition of the above. Mice injected with Freund's or alum adjuvant were used as the respective control. Mouse sera were collected before immunization and 10 days post-each vaccination for detection of antibody responses.Two weeks post-last vaccination, mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine (75/5 mg/kg), and intranasally (i.n.) challenged with 10LD 50 of clade1: VN/1194 or clade2.3.4: SZ/406H H5N1 virus stain. Infected mice were observed and weighed daily for 2 weeks. Lung tissues were collected from euthanized mice 5 days post-challenge for further virological test and histopathological analysis.  ELISA  The M2-specific IgG antibody in the vaccinated mouse sera was detected by ELISA as previously described [31] with some modifications. Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates were pre-coated with 5 μg/ml of M2e-MAP overnight at 4°C. After blocking with 3% BSA containing 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS, serial diluted mouse sera were added to the plates, followed by adding HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 1 h at 37°C. Assay was developed using 3,3',5,5'tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Zymed, Carlsbad, CA), and the reaction was stopped by adding 1N H 2 SO 4 . The absorbance at 450 nm was measured by an ELISA plate reader (Sunrise™ microplate reader, TECAN, NC).  Virus titers in lung tissues  Lung tissues from euthanized mice were aseptically removed and homogenized in minimal essential medium (MEM) plus antibiotics to achieve 10% (w/v) suspensions of lungs. Ten-fold serial dilutions of samples were added in quadruplicate to the monolayer of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells seeded at 96-well cell culture plates 12 h before infection, and allowed to absorb for 2 h at 37°C. Fresh medium was then added to the cells and continued to incubate for 72 h. Virus cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed daily and the viral titer was determined by the hemagglutinin (HA) test indicated as follows. Fifty microlitre of 0.5% turkey red blood cells (Lampire Biological Laboratories, Pipersville, PA) was added to 50 μl of cell culture supernatant and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Wells containing HA were scored as positive. The virus titer was calculated by the Reed and Muench method and expressed as Log 10 TCID 50 /g of lung tissues.  Histopathological analysis  The lung tissues of challenged mice were immediately fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Sections were made at 4-6 μm thickness and mounted on slides. Histopathological changes were examined by H&E staining and observed under light microscopy as previously described [32] .  Statistical analysis  The significance between survival curves was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log-rank test. Other data were analyzed using the 2-tailed Student's t test. P < 0.0001 was considered significant. All analyses were performed in Graphpad Prism software.   			1		1			
20576142	Light whole genome sequence for SNP discovery across domestic cat breeds	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2996934/	BACKGROUND: The domestic cat has offered enormous genomic potential in the veterinary description of over 250 hereditary disease models as well as the occurrence of several deadly feline viruses (feline leukemia virus -- FeLV, feline coronavirus -- FECV, feline immunodeficiency virus - FIV) that are homologues to human scourges (cancer, SARS, and AIDS respectively). However, to realize this bio-medical potential, a high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map is required in order to accomplish disease and phenotype association discovery. DESCRIPTION: To remedy this, we generated 3,178,297 paired fosmid-end Sanger sequence reads from seven cats, and combined these data with the publicly available 2X cat whole genome sequence. All sequence reads were assembled together to form a 3X whole genome assembly allowing the discovery of over three million SNPs. To reduce potential false positive SNPs due to the low coverage assembly, a low upper-limit was placed on sequence coverage and a high lower-limit on the quality of the discrepant bases at a potential variant site. In all domestic cats of different breeds: female Abyssinian, female American shorthair, male Cornish Rex, female European Burmese, female Persian, female Siamese, a male Ragdoll and a female African wildcat were sequenced lightly. We report a total of 964 k common SNPs suitable for a domestic cat SNP genotyping array and an additional 900 k SNPs detected between African wildcat and domestic cats breeds. An empirical sampling of 94 discovered SNPs were tested in the sequenced cats resulting in a SNP validation rate of 99%. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a large collection of mapped feline SNPs across the cat genome that will allow for the development of SNP genotyping platforms for mapping feline diseases.	Background  Along with dogs, the domestic cat enjoys extensive veterinary surveillance, more than any other animal. A rich literature of feline veterinary models reveals a unique opportunity to explore genetic determinants responsible for genetic diseases, infectious disease susceptibility, behavioral and neurological phenotypes, reproduction and physiology (see [1] and [2] for citations). As a highly venerated pet this extraordinarily successful domestic species comprises as many as one billion individuals worldwide. House cats have become a familiar compan-ion to people since their original domestication from the Asian wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica), recently estimated at approximately 10,000 years ago in the Middle East's Fertile Crescent [3] . In spite of our affection for cats, advances in clinical resolution of genetic maladies and complex diseases has been slower than for other species largely due to a delay in achieving a useful whole genome sequence of the cat. This has changed recently with the completion of a draft 1.9X genome sequence of a female Abyssinian cat named Cinnamon who gave us our first glimpse and hope of developing the species as an active player in the genomics era [1, 4] .The availability of a sufficiently dense single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map for a species provides a resource which enables the power of automated high-throughput genotyping to associate regions of the genome to hereditary diseases, quantitative traits, and other phenotypes. High density SNP maps are available for many species including human, mouse, dog, chicken, and rice (for a complete list see [5] ). The cat genome has a moderate collection of SNPs, however the 327,037 available SNPs are clustered into alternating genomic segments of high SNP density and homozygous regions; approximately 60% of Cinnamon's genome is homozygous [4] . This patchwork pattern of the current 1.9X genome sequence was derived from a single inbred cat. To supplement feline SNP map and the genome assembly, we created fosmid libraries and sequenced six additional cats of different breeds and one African wild cat. These sequences dramatically improve the SNP map by increasing the total number of useful SNPs and by filling in the long stretches of genomic homozygosity (~60% of the genome) reported in the 1.9X genome sequence of Cinnamon [4] . In order to make the best use of the additional sequence reads for SNP discovery, we generated a new assembly; the new reads increase the depth-of-coverage of the genome by 50%. This translates to 25% more genomic sequence. Thus this resource provides an improved cat genome assembly as well as a greatly improved SNP map (Assembly: NCBI Accession ACBE00000000, NCBI dbSNP handle CAT_POLY_V17E, and [6] ).  Construction and content  Samples and sequence generation DNA from six domestic cats and one wildcat was collected and isolated using the PAXgene Blood DNA kit as per manufactures instructions (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA.) and stored at -80°C until library construction. The domestic cat samples represented six different breeds from pet owners in the Topeka, KS area, and the wildcat sample was from a captive animal residing at the Audubon Nature Institute, LA. Fosmid libraries were prepared in vector pCC2fos from each DNA sample with an average insert size of approximately 37 kb. A total of 3,178,297 paired-end sequencing reads were generated from the seven libraries (Table 1 ) using standard methods with SPRI-based DNA purification and Big Dye terminator sequencing reagents on ABI3730xl instruments.  Reads, assembly and mapping  Assembly of the cat genome was carried out in a similar method as published for the 1.9X assembly of Cinnamon [4] , except in this case the Phusion method [7] was used for contig and scaffold generation. All 11.4M reads (Table 1) were used, comprising approximately 2.8-fold read redundancy. Contig N50 size is 4.6 kb, an increase of nearly 100% from 2.4 kb in the 1.9X assembly, with total assembled bases at 2.0 Gb, an increase from 1.64 Gb in the 1.9X assembly by 22% (see Additional file 1 Table S1 for a complete listing of the assembly statistics). Mapping of the assembly onto chromosomes used a similar method as previously described [4] with the total sequence placed onto cat chromosomes at 1.71 Gb, an increase from 1.36 Gb. Comparison of this new assembly and the 1.9X assembly to the highly collated NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) generated sequence across feline ENCODE regions [8] shows substantial improvement in coverage from 72% to 84% (Additional file 2 Table S2 ), as well as excellent order and orientation (Additional file 3 and Additional file 4). The 84% coverage figure is a sampling estimate derived from assessing the exact coverage of 26.6 Mb of BAC clone sequence from ENCODE target regions to this assembly, resulting in a higher level of coverage across these regions than an estimated genome average. For example the estimated euchromatic genome size is 2.5 Gb; thus the overall assembled base-pair coverage would be closer to 2.0/2.5 = 80%. The ~4% discrepancy could be due to ENCODE's selection of relatively gene-rich and more highly evolutionarily conserved regions which are likely easier to assemble. In fact, the two lowest covered regions, ENr112 and ENr113, at about 47% coverage, are ENCODE regions with no genes and very low multi-species conservation.  SNPs and DIPs  SNPs are called using the ssahaSNP method [9] by comparing the sequence of each read relative to the consensus sequence assembly, with a breakdown of total SNPs discovered per cat provided in Table 1 . Some fraction of these SNPs is discovered in more than one cat, thus the non-redundant total, 3,077,846, is less than the totals across all the cats, 3,254,739. The SNP rate is calculated relative to the reference sequence, and is determined as the number of neighborhood quality standard (NQS) bases divided by the SNPs detected from a given cat's sequence traces. The NQS method [10] uses a set of parameters to decrease the probability of a base being called incorrectly, which in turn lowers the false reporting of discrepant bases. The settings of the NQS parameters used here are as follows: the base has a PHRED [11, 12] quality score of > = 23, the five bases to either side have a PHRED quality score > = 15, and nine of these ten flanking bases are perfect matches. Since the assembly is made up of all reads from all cats, the SNP rates should be viewed in a relative sense, from Cinnamon with the lowest SNP rate at one SNP per 1520 NQS bases to Nancy with the highest rate at one SNP per 360 NQS bases. The SNP rate is much lower for Cinnamon for two reasons. First, Cinnamon dominates the assembly with the most reads, thus comparing a sequence read from Cinnamon to the assembly has an increased chance of comparing to the same haploid. Second, Cinnamon is inbred and her genome is 60% homozygous, further increasing the chance of comparing a read to the same haploid. At the other extreme, the wild cat, Nancy, gives the highest SNP rate since the African wildcat, Felis silvestris cafra, is one of several continental subspecies of wildcat, the parent species for cat domestication. Domestic cat breeds descend from a founder event (domestication itself ) which reduced genomic diversity appreciably relative to the wildcat species [3] . Domestic cat breeds displayed a SNP rate of 1 SNP/5-600 bp. In the 1.9X cat assembly, the rate of polymorphisms is estimated at one SNP per 600 bases within the heterozygous segments, thus the estimates for the other breeds agree quite well with this previous measure. In addition to SNPs, 682,085 deletion and insertion polymorphisms (DIPs) are detected.  Sampling SNP variation empirically  To validate the accuracy of SNP detection we randomly chose 555 SNPs detected from the fosmid-end sequence of six domestic cats sequenced in this study. We selected SNPs located at least 750 bases away from a sequence contig gap (to make primer design feasible) reducing the number of testable SNPs to 393 of which 348 yielded primers using a primer design package [13] . Two sets of PCR primer plates (47 each) passed stringent primer QC and were sequenced across the six cats plus one additional unrelated domestic shorthair.Sequence traces were analyzed using PolyPhred version 6.11 [14] [15] [16] and the targeted variant bases were viewed using Consed [17] . Of 94 variants, 92 were confirmed, one had low quality sequence traces for the cat carrying the detected variant (Nancy), and one variant detected from the ragdoll, Scooter, was not observed in this cat. Removing the single low-quality amplimer gives an overall validation rate at 92/93 = 99%. Additional file 5 Table S3 gives a complete listing of all SNPs and genotypes from this validation experiment.Forty-five detected DIPs from the sequence traces fell within the PCR amplicons. Of these, 43 were empirically validated, one was not tested and one did not validate (a single base insertion). Therefore, the DIP validation rate would be 43/45 = 96%.

This plasmid was used as a biological barcode. The identifying inserts were amplified and checked using the universal sequencing primers above. The gDNAs were then diluted to a working concentration of 2.5 ng/ul.  Primer QC and Sequencing  Primers were obtained from Eurofins MWG Operon in individual tubes and reconstituted to 100 uM in 10 mM TRIS, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA. The primer pairs were tested at a concentration of 0.16 uM each in 10 ul PCR reactions containing iQ supermix (BioRad) and 5 ng of control feline DNA (Tipper sample used for first round and Speedy used for second round of QC). Cycling conditions were: activate enzyme at 95C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95C for 15 sec, 60C for 15 sec, 72C for 60 sec, then 72C for 5 min and hold at 10C. A 5 ul aliquot of the PCR reaction was examined by agarose gel to look for multiple or missing bands. The PCR products were then diluted to 0.4 ng/ul and sequenced in 6 ul reactions using M13 Universal forward and reverse primers and BDT version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems) using standard ABI protocols. The reactions were sequenced on 3730 DNA Sequencers (Applied Biosystems). The sequence traces were then individually inspected for quality. Primer pairs that resulted in high-quality traces were passed. Primers not passing this round were retested using one additional control DNA. Primers failing both rounds were not used.  PCR  PCR amplification of amplimers was performed in 10 ul reactions in 384-well plates. The reaction conditions were as described above.  Distribution  The existing map of 327 k SNPs from the 1.9X Cinnamon assembly includes large homozygous segments covering approximately 60% of the cat genome (see Figure 5 in [4] ). Figure 1 shows the incidence of SNPs along cat chromosomes, where the number of SNPs is totaled within adjacent 1 Mb windows across each chromosome. In the new assembly, there are only 8 windows with less than 100 SNPs per Mb across the autosomes (out of 2,569 windows, not counting the unmapped regions). On chromosome X there are 34 windows with less than 100 SNPs out of 143 windows, which suggests that X has relatively lower heterozygosity due to at least three factors: 1) two of the eight cats are male, thus reducing the number of X chromosomes to fourteen instead of sixteen chromosomes for an autosomal locus 2) the effective population size for the X chromosome is ¾ that of the autosomes, and 3) male hemizygosity allows much stronger purifying selection to occur around X-linked functional loci. Figure 2 presents the SNP distribution as a fraction of windows of a given size that has at least one SNP. Average SNP spacing in base-pairs is shown in Table 2 . For both SNP counts and the average base-pair distance between SNPs there are three SNP categories: A) SNPs excluding those discovered only from Cinnamon and/or Nancy, B) SNPs excluding those only discovered in Cinnamon, and C) all SNPs ( Table 2 ). The reason to count SNPs in these categories is that for some purposes, SNPs derived from the wildcat Nancy are not as useful as SNPs derived from the domesticated cat breeds. Likewise, inclusion of the highly variable densities of SNPs discovered from Cinnamon's much deeper sequencing would reflect this cat's particular pattern of homozygous and heterozygous regions. Thus, SNPs most useful for domestic cat association screens would be those in category A which totals 964,285 SNPs (Table 2 ). An additional restriction of just those category A SNPs that are mapped to a cat chromosome reduces this count to 844,313. However, relative to the number of mapped bases, we still have a SNP on average spaced every 2000 bases, and even non-chromosomally mapped SNPs will be useful once these segments are mapped in improved future assemblies. Looking again at Figure 2 , over 80% of the 15 kb windows across the genome contain at least one category A SNP.With the genotype information, we can estimate how many informative SNPs are available for a genotyping study among cat breeds. There are 964,285 SNPs discovered from at least one of the six breeds sequenced (category A SNPs in Table 2 ). A SNP will not be informative unless it has a minor allele frequency (MAF) of at least 5%. However, the MAFs of these SNPs are not known until they have been genotyped. With the limited number of genotypes given in Additional file 5 Table S3 , we observe that 24/92 (26%) are only observed in one cat, and therefore could be quite rare variants. However, the other 68/92 (74%) are seen in 2 or more cats, and are therefore quite likely to be polymorphic, and thus informative. This informative fraction increases to 50/57 (88%) for SNPs detected from domestic cat samples. Thus, about 849 k (88% of 964,285) SNPs remain that are likely to have an informative MAF (> = 5%) among cat breeds from this SNP resource.In anticipation of using these SNPs for a genotyping chip, one would like to select the SNPs at fairly even intervals across the genome. If a SNP is selected every 15 kb from the category A SNPs, 80% of the genome can be covered, requiring about 100,000 SNPs in a genotyping array. The remaining 20% can be filled in with either more widely spaced category A SNPs, or using additional category B or C SNPs. Thus perhaps another 20 k genotype assays for the remaining regions would yield a 120 k SNP chip. This is more than double the estimated number proposed for genome-wide association mapping as reported previously [4] .  Wildcat geographical origin  Finally we investigated the geographical origin of the wildcat Nancy. With nearly 1.4 M reads available for this wild cat, this does provide a valuable resource for studying subspecies of Felis silvestris. Nancy was identified as wild-caught 15 years ago in the Arabian Peninsula, so she should geographically fall into the African subspecies Felis silvestris lybica. A STRUCTURE analysis was completed using a genomic DNA sample from Nancy, and genotypes from 18 of the 36 short tandem repeat (STR) loci were used to resolve genomic distinctions among wildcat subspecies effectively [3] . Nancy showed no evidence of domestic cat introgression but instead clusters with cats from southern Africa rather than the Near East,   Conclusions  The primary goal of this effort is to expand feline SNP resources, empowering future linkage and association studies to map feline disease phenotypes to genomic loci. The usefulness of such a resource is clearly proven in many species, most notably for the human and canine genome [18] [19] [20] . A recent review [1] highlights this need for additional cat SNPs to aid the development of a genotype array chip of 100,000-150,000 SNPs. The SNPs discovered by this effort should allow the design of such a chip derived from the 964,285 available SNPs from the domestic breed cats.The value of the sequence generated by this effort will become even greater as the publicly funded effort (see Felis catus entries in [21] ) to generate a high quality draft of Cinnamon's genome is completed, hopefully within the next year. With a high quality draft covering over 90% of the cat genome, even more SNPs can be extracted from the 3M reads from these seven cats, probably 25% more if the assembled sequence increases to 2.5 Gb from the current 2.0 Gb. This resource is further enhanced by having all reads generated from paired-ends of fosmid templates. The insert sizes are all about 40 kb in size with fairly tight distributions of less than 10% coefficient-of-variation. Given an increasingly higher quality assembly of Cinnamon, these paired-end reads could pinpoint structural rearrangements among cat breeds using available methods [22] .   					1			
21110854	Flocked nasal swab versus nasopharyngeal aspirate for detection of respiratory tract viruses in immunocompromised adults: a matched comparative study	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3001728/	BACKGROUND: Several studies have compared nasal swabs to the more invasive nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) for detection of respiratory viruses. Mostly, the comparisons have been performed on immunocompetent children with upper respiratory tract symptoms. The results range from a relatively poor sensitivity for the swabs to an even higher sensitivity than for the NPA. We aimed to investigate the sensitivity of a flocked nasal swab (fNS) on immunocompromised adults with febrile neutropenia. METHODS: During 16 months, adults with a hematological disorder presenting with febrile neutropenia were enrolled in the study. Paired samples of the fNS and NPA were collected in the outer part of the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx, respectively. The samples were analyzed regarding a panel of 15 respiratory viruses by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, as an indirect measure of cell yield by either method, the copy number of the human beta actin gene was also determined. Cohen's kappa was calculated as a measure of agreement of the results obtained from either method. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for comparison of cell yield. RESULTS: A total of 98 paired samples from a total of 89 patients were collected. Twenty of the pairs had virus detected in at least one of the specimens; 11 in both, 7 in NPA only, and 2 in fNS only. For the fNS, the overall sensitivity for any virus and for rhinovirus only was 65% and 78%, respectively. NPA was significantly superior to the fNS in collecting epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: We found the overall sensitivity of 65% to be too low to replace NPA with this sampling technique in this patient category.	Background  A number of studies have compared different sampling techniques for detection of viruses in the upper respiratory tract in immunocompetent children [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . The advantages of using a swab in the nares compared to nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) are for the patient less discomfort and more rapid sampling procedure. For the medical personnel there is a time gain. Finally, the swab goes with a lower cost than does the NPA. Respiratory viruses are common findings in children [15] and adults with hematological malignancies and have been recognized as a potential cause of pneumonia and death [16] . Thus, the sampling frequency for detection of respiratory viruses in this patient category is expected to increase. However, most of the studies comparing sampling techniques are performed on children and, as to our knowledge; to date no study has been performed on immunocompromised individuals which could have a reduced local immunological and inflammatory response, making a direct clinical application of to date achieved results and conclusions impossible. As the swab has been suggested to be comparable with NPA [1, 4, 9] , the primary objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity of detecting respiratory viruses in immunocompromised adults using a flocked nasal swab (fNS) in the outer part of the nose cavity compared to NPA.  Participants  Between January 2008 and May 2009 adults with any hematological disorder presenting at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, for febrile neutropenia (auricular temperature >38.0°C twice or ≥38.5°C at one occasion, and an absolute neutrophil count ≤500 cells/mm 3 ) were asked to participate in this study. The patients were allowed to participate more than once provided that an afebrile period of at least three weeks separated the episodes of febrile neutropenia. At admission, the patients received empirically administrated broad-spectrum antibiotics; ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam.  Collection and storage of material  The collection was made within 72 hours from onset of fever. The fNS with a nylon fiber tip (COPAN, art. no. CP552C) was inserted at least 20 mm and rotated inside each nostril. Then, the NPA was obtained by insertion of a sterile catheter (no. 8, Mediplast, Sweden) into the posterior nasopharynx and pulled back while applying gentle suction. Finally, 2-3 mL of sodium chloride was sucked into the trap. Both specimens were obtained without instillation of any solution into the nostrils. The specimens were stored without any medium in room temperature and transported to the laboratory within six hours. The NPA was stored in its collection tube in minus 80°C. The fiber tip of the fNS was put in 500 μL RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and shaken for 30 minutes. The suspension was stored in minus 80°C.  Detection methods  A total of 400 μL of each sample was extracted and then analyzed regarding presence of nucleic acids from adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, influenzavirus A+B, metapneumovirus, parainfluenzavirus 1-3, rhinovirus, and RS-virus. The extraction method and the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay are previously described [10] . A TaqMan qPCR assay was developed based on amplification of the human beta actin gene (ACTB) (forward primer 5'-GCGCGGCTACAGCTTCA-3' [50 nM], reverse primer 5'-GCGCGGCTACAGCTTCA-3' [900 nM], probe 6FAM-CACCACGGCCGAGC-MGB [150 nM]). The assay was performed on an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The PCR assay was carried out in a total 50-μL reaction mixture containing 25 μL of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 5 μL of template, leaving 20 μL to the primers and probe. The PCR program included 1 cycle at 50°C for 2 min, 1 cycle at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles consisting of 15 sec at 95°C and 60 sec at 60°C. The sensitivity of the assay was 3 copies per reaction, as determined by repeated testing of in-house cloned plasmids.  Ethics  After giving written informed consent the patients were enrolled. The study was approved by The Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm that handles applications for research at Karolinska University Hospital.  Statistical methods  Positivity by either method was used as gold standard for presence of viruses. Cohen's kappa was calculated as a measure of agreement of the results obtained from either method [17] . Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used when appropriate. Age is presented as means ± SD, whereas neutrophil count is presented as median followed by range. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. InStat 3.05 and Prism 5.00 for Windows were used.  Results  A total of 98 episodes of febrile neutropenia occurring in 89 patients were included in the study. Based on episodes, the mean age was 55 ± 15 years (43 females, 57 ± 13 years; 55 males, 53 ± 16 years) and the median neutrophil count <100 cells/mm 3 (<100-500). As underlying hematological disorder, acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome predominated (n = 42, 43%) followed by non-Hodgking lymphoma (n = 33, 34%) and myeloma (n = 13, 13%). The remaining diagnoses were chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 6, 6%) and Hodgking's lymphoma (n = 4, 4%). In total, 49 (50%) of the patients were on antiviral prophylaxis with aciclovir. The patients were sampled within one day from admittance (n = 54, 55%), but due to practical obstacles, in 32 (33%) and 9 (9%) of the cases, the samples were collected on the second and third day after admittance, respectively. In total, 98 paired samples collected with fNS and NPA respectively, were obtained. A total of 20 of the pairs had virus detected in one or both of the specimens; 7 exclusively in NPA and 2 exclusively in fNS ( Table 1 ). The sensitivity for the fNS in detection of any virus was 65% (95% CI = 41-85) and for rhinovirus 78% (95% CI = 40-97). The positivity rates for any virus for the NPA and fNS were 18.4% (18 of 98) and 13.3% (13 of 98), respectively, showing a "substantial" agreement (for rhinovirus an "almost perfect" agreement) according to Landis and Koch's scale [17] .The amount of cells yielded by NPA approximated by ACTB copy numbers was significantly larger than by fNS with a mean difference of 4.2 × 10 5 cells/mL (p = .001). In pairs with virus detected in both methods, the Ct values were lower (thus viral load higher) for NPA than for fNS. We plotted the difference in cell count between fNS and NPA against the difference in Ct values between the methods for the positive pairs. Although not statistically significant, the correlation indicate a possible association between a high cell yield and low Ct value (r = -0.46, p = .15).  Discussion  We compared the efficacy to collect specimen for viral detection between fNS and NPA. According to Landis and Koch's [17] scale there was a substantial agreement between the methods, to NPA's favor, and NPA was significantly more efficient collecting epithelial material approximated by quantification of ACTB. Even if removal of the cellular component of NPA does not interfere with quantification of some respiratory viruses [18] , a higher cell count might indicate a higher yield of specimen. Even though not statistically significant, the Ct value negatively correlated to the number of cells collected, and thus, the finding of NPA being superior to the fNS in collecting cells invite us to speculate that the fNS sometimes may collect inadequate amount of specimen in order to reach the PCR method's detection limit. Furthermore, several reports have suggested that sensitivity increases when the nasopharynx is sampled instead of the nasal cavity [2, 5, 11, 14] .Thus, the difference in sensitivity for the fNS and NPA could have several reasons; biological and technical. One obvious biological reason is the fact that two different anatomical sites are investigated; one technical explanation could be that suction is superior scratching for collecting adequate amount material. The production of mucus that transports the viral nucleic acids in an anterior direction to the fNS's sampling site may be an important parameter. In this patient category, the lack of a competent immune response could reduce the mucus-production. Taking the above into account, the depth of the sampling with the fNS probably plays an important role. However, a deeper penetration could cause even more discomfort than does the NPA.In contrast to our findings, several groups have reached good sensitivity using the fNS in the outer part of the nose and concluded it comparable to NPA [1, 4, 9] . Sung et al who used an insertion depth of only 1-1.5 cm summarized the fNS an even better option when using PCR.This study has several limitations. The time interval between fever onset and sampling varied between the patients, and they did not necessarily have respiratory tract symptoms. Furthermore, the patients suffered from different underlying diseases. However, this reflects the clinical reality and as both sampling methods were used at the same time point in the same patient, the comparison is still valid. The foremost important limitation is the low number of positive samples on which the calculation of sensitivity is based. However, the upper limit in the 95% confidence interval for the overall sensitivity was 85% which is still a questionable value for replacing an established method.In summary, the NPA was superior to the fNS in collecting epithelial cells. Furthermore, we also found lower sensitivity for the fNS than for NPA in detecting respiratory viruses in these immunocompromised adults. For detection of rhinovirus it was slightly better, but still not appropriate, according to our judgment, for clinical use in this patient category. With an insertion depth comparable to what other groups have used we found lower sensitivity for the fNS than previous investigators. Less mucus production and consequently less anterior transport of viral nucleic acid in immunocompromised individuals may explain this finding.  Conclusions  On the basis of our findings, fNS sampling of the nares for viral detection in immunocompromised individuals cannot be recommended until further large studies have revealed more promising results.  				1				
21324206	Down-regulation of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor by 3C-like proteinase in transfected A549 human lung carcinoma cells	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048559/	BACKGROUND: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a severe respiratory illness caused by a novel virus, the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) of SARS-CoV plays a role in processing viral polypeptide precursors and is responsible of viral maturation. However, the function of 3CL(pro )in host cells remains unknown. This study investigated how the 3CL(pro )affected the secretion of cytokines in the gene-transfected cells. RESULTS: From immunofluorescence microscopy, the localization of c-myc tagged 3CL(pro )was detected both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected A549 cells. Expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was significantly decreased in 3CL(pro)-transfected cells by both RT-PCR and ELISA, but without changes in other cytokines, i.e., IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL12p40, TNF-α, and TGF-β. Furthermore, the protein levels of NF-kB decreased in 3CL(pro)-transfected A549 cells when compared to EGFP transfected cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the 3CL(pro )may suppress expression of GM-CSF in transfected A549 cells through down-regulation of NF-kB production.	Background  Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged as a communicable human disease in November 2002 and rapidly spread throughout the world [1] . A coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified as the causative agent [2, 3] . SARS-CoV is a plus-strand RNA virus featuring a large single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 29.7 kb [4] that contains 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) with multiple enzymatic functions. These are known or are predicted to include types of enzymes that are common components of the replication machinery of plus-strand RNA viruses [5, 6] . In these nsps, the Nsp5 [main protease (M pro ) or 3C-like protease (3CL pro )] is responsible for the proteolytic processing of viral polypeptides into functional proteins and 3CL pro mutant, C145A, blocks the maturation process [7] . This viral protease has been the target for design of the inhibitors [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Recently, SARS-3CL pro was found to induce cell apotosis and interact with cellular vacuolar-H + ATPase [12, 13] . Several human proteins might possess a similar structure of SARS-3CL pro cleavage sites using computational methods [14] . Theses studies implied the SARS-3CL pro could involve in virusinduced host pathology.SARS-CoV causes a severe lung infection, and the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract are the primary targets [15] [16] [17] . SARS-CoV reproduces rapidly and causes massive cell damage. At the whole-body level, immune-mediated damage, due to activation of cytokines and/or chemokines [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and, perhaps, autoimmunity [23, 24] , may play key roles in the clinical and pathological features of SARS. One of the major causes of host death is the induction of lung fibrosis. The mechanism of the lung fibrosis caused by SARS-CoV requires elucidation. Significant efforts have been made to analyze the function of SARS-3CL pro on viral replication, but the impact of SARS-3CL pro on cytokines of the host cell is still unclear. In this study, we constructed the pEGFP-C3 vector with SARS-3CL pro gene and transfected it into A549 lung epithelial cells. The expression profiles of cytokines were validated by RT-PCR and ELISA. The results indicated that the expression and secretion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) decrease in SARS-3CL pro transfected A549 cells. Furthermore, NF-kB, putative regulators of GM-CSF gene expression, was also decreased on its protein level in 3CL pro transfected cells.  Results  Construction of SARS-CoV 3CL pro wild type and a mutant C145A clone into pEGFP-C3 vectorTo optimize the efficiency of transfection and expression of functional 3CL pro in A549 lung cancer cell line, we constructed expression vector expressing SARS-CoV 3CL pro wild type gene into a pEGFP-C3 vector ( Figure 1A ). An inactive 3CL pro mutant, C145A (TGT GCT), was also included in this study as a negative control [7] . Furthermore, the myc tag sequence was also introduced into the 3' end of the 3CL pro and C145A genes for immunofluorescence analysis. The DNA fragments of CMV promoter, 3CL pro wild type, and C145A 3CL pro mutant were amplified by PCR using primers containing restriction enzyme sites as shown in Figure 1A . The expression constructs were further verified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis after restriction enzymes digestion ( Figure 1B ). As expected, the 597 bp of PCMV and 956 bp of 3CL pro (and C145A) fragments were excised from plasmids with appropriate restriction enzymes and were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Expression of EGFP, 3CL pro , and C145A in A549 cellsThe plasmids of pEGFP-C3, pEGFP-3CL pro , and pEGFP-C145A were successfully transfected into A549 cells respectively. The expression levels of 3CL pro and C145A mRNA were determined by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and the protein expression levels were analyzed using 2D western blots (Figure 2A and 2B). The results indicated that the expression of 3CL pro and C145A mRNA reached the highest level in A549 cells at 12 to 24 hrs and slightly decreased their expression at 48 h after transfection. However, 2D western blots results indicated that the protein expression levels of 3CL pro and C145A steadily increased with time up to 48 hrs after transfection. To track the locations of 3CL pro and C145A proteins in transfected A549 cells, Myc-tagged 3CL pro and C145A were detected using rhodamineconjugated anti-Myc antibodies. The immunofluorescence microscopic images demonstrated 60-70% transfection efficiency (data not shown) and the localizations of c-myc tagged 3CL pro and C145A were detected both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected A549 cells compared to control EGFP ( Figure 3 ). compared to the EGFP transfected A549 cells at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hrs is 9%, 17%, 25%, 49%, and 56%, respectively. There was significant decrease of GM-CSF in 3CL pro transfected A549 cells after 24 hrs (p < 0.005).Additionally, there were no change to the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL12p40, TNF-α, and TGF-β found in 3CL pro transfected cells. To confirm the mRNA expression of GM-CSF, other primer pairs were used to amplify GM-CSF by semi-quantification RT-MPCR. As shown in Figure 4B , decreased expression of GM-CSF was noted in 3CL pro transfected cells compared to GAPDH in A549 cells and EGFP transfected cells at 24, 48, and 72 hrs. A significant decrease of GM-CSF was observed in 3CL pro transfected A549 cells after 24, 48, and 72 hrs with maximal reduction folds of vector control about 0.75, 0.53 and 0.45, respectively (p < 0.005).The secretion of GM-CSF in SARS-3CL pro transfected A549 cells by ELISA As shown in Figure 5 , the values of GM-CSF concentration in the culture mediums of EGFP transfected A549 cells at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hrs were 2.047 ± 0.2(pg/ml), 9.928 ± 0.13(pg/ml), 11.657 ±. 15   Involvement of NF-B in 3CL pro -mediated GM-CSF expression in A549 cells  To investigate whether ERK1/2, p38, and JNK MAPK pathways and NF-B were involved in 3CL pro -mediated GM-CSF production in A549 cells [25, 26] , we examined the expression levels of these MAP kinases and NF-B by western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 6 (a bar graph including mean and standard deviation were provided in Additional File 1), the expression of NF-B was reduced in 3CL pro transfected cells at 48 hrs after transfection compared to cells transfected with EGFP. In contrast, over expression of 3CL pro did not change the expression levels of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK in A549 cells significantly.  Discussion  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) causes a severe lung infection [18] [19] [20] . It is important to elucidate the mechanism of the lung fibrosis caused by SARS-CoV. The expression of 3CL pro and C145A in A549 cells was established (Figures 2 and 3 ) to elucidate the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV in lung epithelial cells. The localization patterns of 3CL pro and C145A were observed both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of A549 cells by immunofluorescence ( Figure 3 ). Decreased expression and levels of GM-CSF were found in 3CL protransfected cells using RT-PCR, but not in C145A transfected cells (Figure 2A ). Down-regulation of GM-CSF expression by 3CL pro in A549 cells may be attributed in part to the reduced protein level of NF-kB ( Figure 6 ). In addition, there were no significant decreases in the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL12p40, TNF-α, TGF-β using RT-MPCR. This finding is consistent with that of Ziegler et al [27] who reported no induction of cytokines genes (IFN-α, IFN-β, IL-28, IL-29, TNF-α, CCLl5 or CXCL10) or IFN-α/β-induced MxA gene in SARS-CoV-infected A549 cells. GM-CSF was originally defined by its ability to generate in vitro granulocyte and macrophage colonies from bone marrow precursor cells [28] . Apart from its physiological role in the control of alveolar macrophage development, it now appears more likely that its major role lies in its ability to govern the properties of the more mature myeloid cells of the granulocyte and macrophage lineages, particularly during host defense and inflammatory reactions. Recent evidence for the key role of GM-CSF in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases is summarized [29] . GM-CSF-deficient mice showed an increased susceptibility to pulmonary infections [30, 31] . In addition, some studies also demonstrated that impaired production of GM-CSF played a role in the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis [32, 33] . Together, there is growing evidence suggesting that GM-CSF is an important regulator of the alveolar epithelium, surfactant homeostasis, and lung host defense [31, 34] . To support the above, our experimental results show decreased expression and secretion of GM-CSF in 3CL pro -transfected cells, and suggest that SARS-3CL pro will affect host defense.Due to the functional importance of SARS-CoV 3CL pro in proteolytic recognition and processing of the virus polyproteins, the experimental approaches and computational prediction of substrate cleavage sites of 3CL pro become attractive topics in anti-SARS drug design [8] [9] [10] [11] 15, 35] . It is clear that the 3CL pro cleavage sites are consistent preferentially with relative position of P1'-Ser/Ala P1-Gln P2-Leu [35, 36] . In this study, 3CL pro transfected A549 cells decreased the protein levels of NF-kB with subsequent decline in GM-CSF mRNA and protein expression (Figures 4-6) . The amino acid sequence analyses of NF-kB indicated that noncanonical 3CL pro cleavage sites (such as P1'-Tyr/Gln/ Arg/Ile P1-Gln P2-Leu) commonly existed in NF-kB. Interestingly, NF-kB are associated in GM-CSF production in lung cancer cell lines [37] . In depth investigations are required to determine whether 3CL pro directly or indirectly affects the protein levels of NF-kB in transfected A549 cell.  Conclusions  The role of the viral cytopathic effect in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-associated lung diseases involvement remains unclear. Our results reveals that the 3CL pro -induced decreased GM-CSF herein may provide further information on the pathogenesis of lung diseases with associated SARS-CoV. Also, the protein levels of NF-kB decreased in 3CL pro transfected cells. Thus, we conclude that 3CL pro may mediate down-regulation of NF-kB production and subsequently suppress GM-CSF mRNA and protein expression in transfected A549 cells. Therefore, the SARS-CoV 3CL pro may play a role in the mechanism of lung fibrosis of SARS through the suppression of GM-CSF.  Plasmids  Plasmid pEGFP-C3 was obtained from CLONTECH (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, USA). This plasmid contains the EGFP variant and neomycin resistant genes under the control of the cytomegalovirus early gene promoter and the SV40 early gene promoter, respectively. Full-length 3CL pro versions (wild type and mutant, C145A) and CMV promoter were amplified by PCR using primers containing suitable restriction sites for subcloning into the pEGFP-C3 vector (3CL pro primers: 5' ATATGGTACCAgTGGTTTTAGGAAAATG into Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells, which were obtained from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, California, USA). Restriction enzyme digestion, PCR and DNA sequencing analysis (Mission Biotech, Taipei, Taiwan) were used to verify the plasmids.  Cell culture and Transfection  The human lung carcinoma A549 cells were obtained from American type culture collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA, USA) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (GIBCO-BRL, Carlsbad, California, USA) at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. A total of 1 × 10 6 cells were grown to 70% confluence in 100 mm 2 culture plates before transfection. The transfection reaction was performed by using Lipofectamine plus reagents (Invitrogen, California, USA) with 2 μg of each plasmid, pEGFP-C3, pEGFP-3CL pro , and pEGFP-C145A according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were then cultured in serum-free DMEM for 12 hrs at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 incubator and subsequently in DMEM with 10% FBS.  Immunofluorescence cell staining and Fluorescence Microscopy  EGFP, 3CL pro and C145A transfected A549 cells were cultured on sterile cover slides for overnight and fixed by methanol. Samples were blocked with 10% blocking serum and incubated with 3CL pro antibody (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) and rhodamine conjugated second antibody (Invitrogen Corporation; Grand Island, NY) separately. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). All transfected A549 cells were observed with a Zeiss Axioplan-2 epifluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate fluorescence filters. Digital images of the cells were recorded by using a spot camera system.  mRNA analysis and RT-MPCR  All studies were carried out in a designated PCR-clean area. After treatments at 12-72 hrs, cell pellets were washed in DPBS twice and treated with Trizol mRNA lysis buffer for total RNA extraction. All samples were analyzed by reverse transcriptase Multiplex PCR (RT-MPCR) with messageScreenTM Human Inflammatory Cytokine Set 1 Multiplex PCR kits (Biosource, International, Inc., CA, USA) for a temporal and spatial distribution of mRNA expression of different cytokines. This method is an accurate and valid system to detect multiple gene expression by amplifying all the genes under the same conditions. The PCR derived DNA fragments, obtained by 25 PCR cycles, and was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.7% agarose gel. The cDNAs encoding human granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and GAPDH were amplified by RT-PCR using the following primer pairs: 5'-TGAGTAGA-GACACTGCTGCTG-3' (forward primer for GM-CSF cDNAs), 5'-TCAAAGGGGATGACAAGCAGAA-3' (reverse primer for GM-CSF cDNAs), 5'-CATGTTCGT-CATGGGTGTGA-3' (forward primer for GAPDH cDNAs), and 5'-AGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGCTC-3' (reverse primer for GAPDH cDNAs). The amplification was performed in a 50 μl reaction volume containing 1× reaction buffer (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA), 1.5 μM of MgCl 2 , 200 μM of dNTPs, 1 μM of each primer and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) using a Perkin-Elmer Gene Amp PCR system 2400. Each cycle consists of denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for 45 sec, and amplification at 72°C for 45 sec. The RT-PCR derived DNA fragments obtained by 30 PCR cycles were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.7% agarose gel. Following staining with ethidium bromide, the gels were photographed and band intensity was measured under UV light using the Alphaimager 2200 (Alphalnnotech, San Leandro, CA, USA). The specific RNA level of every sample was expressed as the product's intensity. cDNA encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was quantified and used to normalize the expression of GA-CSF and each cytokine for each sample.  Cytokine ELISA  The quantification of cytokine levels from the cell culture mediums was performed by duplication using ELISA kits for GM-CSF (Biosource International, Inc, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. In each case, the optical density of known standards was used to construct a calibration curve and the mean cytokine values ± SD were then calculated for each sample.  Statistical analysis  Statistical analysis was performed using the paired t-test. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. GraphPad Prism software v5.01 (GraphPad Software Inc., USA) was employed for the analysis of covariance by comparing linear regression lines. Because the slopes differ so much, it is not possible to test whether the intercepts differ significantly.  2-DE  The 2-DE procedure was performed as described elsewhere with minor modification [38] . Briefly, 100 μg of protein was loaded onto IPG strips (18 cm, pH 3-10, GE Healthcare) for analytic 2-DE analysis. The IPG strips were subsequently rehydrated on the IPGphor IEF system (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) at 20°C and 30 V for 14 h. Subsequently, IEF was conducted at 8000 V for 56 kVh for analytic analysis. Strips were then treated with equilibration buffer containing dithiothreitol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and then alkylated with iodoacetate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 15 min. The IPG strips were transferred onto 10-18% linear gradient polyacrylamide gels (18×18 cm) and the electrophoresis was performed at 45 mA per gel at 4°C.  Western blot  Proteins that had been resolved on 12.5% SDS-PAGE or 2-DE gels were electroblotted onto PVDF membranes using a semi-dry apparatus (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% non-fat milk and 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS, followed by incubation with primary antibody (3CL pro , NF-kB, ERK1/2, JNK, p38, GAPDH, Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST), the primary antibody was detected with an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence western blotting detection system (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA,).

21479269	A Mutation in Myo15 Leads to Usher-Like Symptoms in LEW/Ztm-ci2 Rats	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3066203/	The LEW/Ztm-ci2 rat is an animal model for syndromal deafness that arose from a spontaneous mutation. Homozygous animals show locomotor abnormalities like lateralized circling behavior. Additionally, an impaired vision can be observed in some animals through behavioral studies. Syndromal deafness as well as retinal degeneration are features of the Usher syndrome in humans. In the present study, the mutation was identified as a base substitution (T->C) in exon 56 of Myo15, leading to an amino acid exchange from leucine (Leu) to proline (Pro) within the carboxy-terminal MyTH4 domain in the proteins' tail region. Myo15 mRNA was expressed in the retina as demonstrated for the first time with the help of in-situ hybridization and PCR. To characterize the visual phenotype, rats were examined by scotopic and photopic electroretinography and, additionally, histological analyses of the retinas were conducted. The complete loss of sight was detected along with a severe degeneration of photoreceptor cells. Interestingly, the manifestation of the disease does not solely depend on the mutation, but also on environmental factors. Since the LEW/Ztm-ci2 rat features the entire range of symptoms of the human Usher syndrome we think that this strain is an appropriate model for this disease. Our findings display that mutations in binding domains of myosin XV do not only cause non-syndromic hearing loss but can also lead to syndromic disorders including retinal dysfunction.	Introduction  The LEW/Ztm-ci2 rat (ci = circling), previously described as an animal model for syndromal deafness, arose as a spontaneous mutation in the inbred strain LEW/Ztm in 1991. The mode of inheritance of the deviant phenotype is autosomal recessive. In addition to deafness, the animals show spontaneous lateralized circling behavior, stargazing, locomotor hyperactivity, moderate ataxia and the inability to swim. Motor abnormalities can either be induced through stress or occur spontaneously [1] . The symptoms manifest during the first three weeks of life. Histological analysis of the inner ear revealed that the organ of Corti, which includes inner and outer hair cells, is completely absent or occasionally reduced. However, inner hair cells and outer hair cells of the vestibular organs are both present. Characteristic effects in this area are shortened stereocilia, a lower number of ganglion cells and a reduced thickness of axons [2] .There are a number of mouse and rat strains that show a phenotype similar to the LEW/Ztm-ci2 rat such as the shaker-2 mouse (STOCK Myo15 sh2 /J), which incidentally carries a mutation in the Myo15 gene [3] .Myosin XV is assigned to a protein family, namely the unconventional myosins, which are involved in various cellular functions such as cell motility, cytoplasmatic transport and movement processes, endocytosis and exocytosis, regulation of ion channels and also play an important role within the actin cytoskeleton [4] [5] [6] [7] . Function of the myosin XV protein includes the maintenance of actin organization in hair cells of the organ of Corti. Therefore, it seems to be critical for the normal cytoskeletal morphology [3] .In humans, mutations in Myo15 cause the non-syndromic autosomal recessive profound hearing loss disorder (DFNB3) [8, 9] . Mutations in some of the other unconventional myosins, such as myosin VI and VIIa, have also been reported to be responsible for hereditary deafness in humans, mice and rats [10] [11] [12] 13] .The shaker-1 (STOCK Myo7a sh1 /J) mouse and the tornado rat (Crl:WI-Myo7a tnd ) are further examples for strains showing phenotypes comparable to LEW/Ztm-ci2 rats. In both cases the underlying mutations were traced to the Myo7a gene [13, 14] .MYO7A is one of several genes responsible for the human Usher syndrome (USH) [15] . This is a clinically variable human disease, with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss, vestibular dysfunctions and visual impairment. The disease is caused by several mutations in proteins integrated in the Usher protein network. The syndrome has three distinct clinical subtypes [16] referred to as USH1, USH2, USH3, which vary in the severity of disease manifestation with USH1 being the most severe form. Patients suffer from profound hearing loss, constant vestibular dysfunction (balance deficiency) and a prepubertal onset of retinitis pigmentosa. The latter is characterized by a progressive degeneration of the retinal photoreceptor cells [17] that leads to night blindness and visual field loss over the course of several decades [18, 19] .We were able to identify the mutation causing the deviant phenotype of the LEW/Ztm-ci2 rat in the Myo15 gene. During our study we only observed the retinal phenotype in some animals and believe that it is dependent on environmental factors. Our findings confirm what was already suggested by Gockeln et al., 2003 and Löscher et al., 2009 /2010 : The LEW/Ztm-ci2 rat is a valuable animal model for the human Usher syndrome.  Animals  Homozygous LEW/Ztm-ci2 rats of both genders were used and all animals originated from the CAF breeding colony. The coisogenic background strain LEW/Ztm (F122/123) served as control. Age of animals used for electrophysiological or histological investigations ranged between 400 and 750 days, with an average of 550 days.Husbandry and experiments were in accordance with the German Animal Welfare Legislation (Tierschutzgesetz: http:// foundation.aalas.org/). All experiments were also approved by the local Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Commitee and by the local government, namely the Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety (approval ID: 509c-42502-03/651).  Husbandry  Animals were kept in a controlled environment with a temperature of 2262uC, relative humidity of approximately 55%, and artificial light from 5:30 h to 19:30 h. The rats were kept on a sterilized commercial softwood granulate bedding (Lignocel, Altromin; Lage, Germany) and received commercial pellet diet (Altromin, 1314) and water ad libitum. Rats were kept alone, as pairs, or as sibling groups in wire-topped type III MacrolonH cages (Techniplast, Italy) in Hannover Medical School. In the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover animals were kept alone. Microbiological status was monitored according to the FELASA recommendations [23] . In both facilities mutant (LEW/Ztm-ci2) and control (LEW/Ztm) strains were housed in the same rooms under the same conditions.  DNA isolation  For tissue collection, animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation after anesthesia with CO 2 . Lysis of tissue samples (ear, tail) was prepared overnight at 55uC in 400 ml lysis buffer, containing 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 200 mM of NaCl, 0.2% of SDS, 5 mM of EDTA, and 100 mg/ml of freshly added Proteinase K. Samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 6000 g and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube or plate. Genomic DNA was isolated by adding an equal amount of isopropanol, mixing and subsequent centrifugation for 20 min at 6000 g. Pellets were rinsed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in 400 ml H 2 O. For PCR, 5 ml of a 50 fold dilution in water was used.  PCR and sequencing  Resequencing of all exons of Myo15 and of Kcnj12 was performed using LIMSTILL, LIMS for Induced Mutations by Sequencing and TILLing (http://limstill.niob.knaw.nl). LIM-STILL was used to generate the Myo15 project and visualize the gene structure based on Ensembl file ENSRNOG00000028597.The primer design application within LIMSTILL is Primer3based and parameters are set to design primers with an optimal melting temperature of 58uC.PCR was performed using a touchdown thermocycling program (92uC for 60 sec; 12 cycles of 92uC for 20 sec, 65uC for 20 sec with a decrement of 0.4uC per cycle, 72uC for 30 sec; followed by 20 cycles of 92uC for 20 sec, 58uC for 20 sec and 72uC for 30 sec; 72uC for 180 sec; GeneAmp9700, Applied Biosystems). PCR reaction mixes contained 5 ml genomic DNA, 0.2 mM forward primer and 0.2 mM reverse primer, 200 mM of each dNTP, 25 mM Tricine, 7.0% Glycerol (w/v), 1.6% DMSO (w/v), 2 mM MgCl 2 , 85 mM Ammonium acetate pH 8.7 and 0.2 U Taq Polymerase in a total volume of 10 ml.PCR products were diluted with 20 ml water and 1 ml was used as template for the sequencing reactions. Sequencing reactions, containing 0.25 ml BigDYE (v1.1; Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk a/d IJssel, The Netherlands), 3.75 ml 2.56 dilution buffer (Applied Biosystems) and 0.4 mM gene specific primer in a total volume of 10 ml, were performed using cycling conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Sequencing products were purified by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 40 mM sodium-acetate and analyzed on a 96-capillary 3730XL DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were analyzed using PolyPhred [24] .  Real Time PCR  RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturers' instructions. Pituitary gland tissue from LEW/Ztm and LEW/Ztm-ci2 rats as well as retina tissue collected from LEW/Ztm rats were disrupted and homogenized in QIAzol Lysis Reagent. Then, from 1 mg of RNA, cDNA was synthesized using the Omniscript Reverse Transkription Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Primers for the Myo15 fragment were designed using the Oligo 6 program (Molecular Biology Insights); primer: Myo15-mRNA fw 59.ACCTGCCCAGTGTGCGTGAG,39, Myo15-mRNA rev 59.TGGTGGGGACTGAG TGCCTG,39. Reaction mixes contained 10 ng cDNA, 2,5 ml biotherm Buffer (with 15 mmol MgCl), 1,5 ml of each primer (10 mM), 0,5 ml dNTP's (10 mM), 2 ml SYBRH Green, 1 U Biotherm Taq in a total volume of 25 ml. Reaction was done using the opticon cycler (MJ Research) with the following cycling conditions: 95uC for 3 minutes, 40 cycles of 95uC for 30 sec., 67,7uC for 30 sec. and 72uC for 30 sec. followed by 72uC for 10 min. Amplified DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis using 3:1 Biozym Sieve agaroseH (Biozym).  Electroretinography (ERG)  All procedures involving animals adhered to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research. Electroretinograms were recorded according to the standard of the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision [25] . The ERG equipment comprised a Ganzfeld bowl, a DC amplifier and a PCbased control and recording unit (Roland Consult, Brandenburg/ Wiesbaden, Germany).Rats were dark-adapted overnight (at least 12 hours). Pupils were dilated using 2,5% phenylephrine and 1% tropicamide, which was administered 20 minutes before measurement. Rats were anesthetized with a mixture of Ketaminhydrochloride (100 mg/kg BW i.p.) and Xylazine (4 mg/kg BW i.p.). Needle electrodes, subcutaneously placed, served as reference (ear base) and ground (tail base) electrodes.After topical anesthesia of the eyes with metacaine, ca. 0,5 mm circular gold-wire loop electrodes were placed over the bulbi. All procedures were carried out in absolute darkness using red light. Scotopic (rod) recordings were performed with a series of white single flashes with six increasing stimulus intensities reaching from 0.01 to 30.0 cds/m 2 . On each level 3 to 5 flashes were recorded with a frequency of 0,2 to 0,1 Hz and averaged. Interstimulus intervals between levels lasted 30 sec. In a second step, rats were light adapted for 10 minutes with a background of 25 cd/m 2 . Photopic (cone) responses were recorded with a series of five increasing stimulus intensities of 3.0 cds/m 2 up to 100 cds/m 2 . The a-wave amplitude was measured from the prestimulus baseline to the minimum value of the first negative deflection. The b-wave values were measured from the trough of the a-wave to the maximum positive value.  Histology  For histological evaluations, eyes were fixed in glutaraldehyde. After dehydration in a graded ethanol series (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% and absolute ethanol), the tissues were embedded in Technovit 7100 (Heraeus Kulzer, Wehrheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. After infiltration with infiltration solution (hardener 1 and Technovit 7100) for 12 h, the eyes were cut into halves along the line of the optic nerve and embedded in Histoform S according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Microtomy was executed strictly perpendicular to the retinal surface. Serial sections of 1-3 mm were stained with haematoxylin (Gill) and eosin.  Comparison of environmental factors  Microbiological monitoring was performed according to FELASA recommendations [23] . Light intensity was measured in different locations in the room and in three different rack levels (top row, bottom row and middle row) in front of the cages and inside the cages. For analysis an illuminance meter (roline digital luxmeter) was used.In situ hybridization Myo15 mRNA Eyes were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4uC and embedded in paraffin. The following antisense oligonucleotide probe was used: 59-CATCGTCATCCGCTTCCCCGGAC-GACGCGG-39. The 59-end digoxigenin-labeled probe recognizes Myo15 and was obtained from MWG-Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Gemany). A corresponding sense oligo-probe was used as control. Deparaffinized, lightly dried 4 mm sections were rinsed in TBS, 200 mM HCl, and 0.5% acetic anhydride for 20 min, followed by a digestion with 0.1% proteinase K for 30 min at 37uC. Slides were rinsed again in TBS, dehydrated in ascendant concentrations of ethanol, and stretched at 95uC for 5 min. Sections were hybridized at 45uC for 18 h, followed by washings with 26SSC (standard saline citrate) for 3620 min, 50% formamide (in SSC) for 3620 min at 55uC and 16SSC for 2615 min. Afterwards slides were incubated with anti-DIG AP for 30 min and NBT/ BCIP for 2 h (DIG Nucleic Acid Detection Kit, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Slides were viewed with an Axioplan 2 imaging microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) for in situ mRNA expression.  Results  The mutation of the LEW/Ztm-ci2 rat was traced to a base substitution in exon 56 of Myo15In a previous study a genome-wide scan of a (LEW/ Ztm-ci26BN/Ztm) F16LEW/Ztm-ci2 backcross population demonstrated a strong association of the circling 2 phenotype with a region localized centrally in RNO10. Rat BAC clones were used to create a physical map of this region of interest. Two candidate genes, Myo15 and Kcnj12, were selected based on their genomic localization and involvement in a similar pathology in human and mouse [26] .To identify the mutation we resequenced exons of both genes using PCR and conventional dideoxy sequencing. Two nonreference alleles of Myo15 were identified by comparing sequences of the mutated rat strain LEW/Ztm-ci2 and its co-isogenic background strain LEW/Ztm. The detected base substitution from T to C at position 43612 in exon 56 leads to an amino acid change from leucine to proline (L3157P) within the carboxyterminal MyTH4 (myosin tail homology-4) domain of the protein (Fig. 1) . The leucine residue at position 3157 is conserved throughout the vertebrate lineage, according to MultiZ alignments in the UCSC Genome Browser (http://ucsc.genome.gov). The PolyPhen program predicted this amino acid change to be ''possibly damaging'' to protein function. Resequencing of Kcnj12 revealed no additional mutation.  Expression of Myo15 transcripts  To determine whether the base pair substitution affects Myo15 mRNA expression in general, a Real Time PCR of a Myo15 specific fragment was carried out. RNA was extracted from the pituitary gland of LEW/Ztm-ci2 and LEW/Ztm rats as the highest Myo15 RNA expression has been reported for this tissue [27] . Myo15 signals were normalized against beta-actin signals. The results indicate that there are no significant differences in Myo15 transcript levels in the pituitary glands of the LEW/Ztm-ci2 rat compared to rats of the LEW/Ztm background strain.  Electroretinographic investigations indicated an involvement of the visual system  Behavioral observations of some LEW/Ztm-ci2 rats using several screening techniques for sensory functions [28, 29] and preliminary electrophysiological investigations indicated that the vision might be impaired (pers. comm., v. Hörsten, data not shown) [20] . To characterize the eye phenotype of this strain, an electroretinographic survey of LEW/Ztm-ci2 rats (n = 7 per group) and LEW/Ztm rats (n = 7 per group) was carried out. Owing to its results, animals were subdivided into two groups. One group included only animals that were born, raised and maintained at the Central Animal Facility of Hannover Medical School (group MedSchool) for their entire life. In this group, the electrophysiological examinations of LEW/Ztm-ci2 rats and LEW/Ztm control rats solely revealed physiological responses (Fig. 2, 3 -A/C).Animals of the second group were also born and raised in the Central Animal Facility of Hannover Medical School, however, they were at some point transferred and then housed in the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover (group VetSchool). All LEW/Ztm-ci2 rats showed decreased responses of the photoreceptor cells, both rods and cones (Fig. 2, 3, Table 1 ), which means that the incidence of the retinal phenotype was 100 percent. A complete loss of responses was observed in 36% (Fig. 3-B) . In contrast, electroretinograms of LEW/Ztm control rats appeared normal (Fig. 2, 3-D, Table 1 ).  Retinal degeneration was discovered by histological examination  Electroretinography is an appropriate method for the early detection of retinal alterations as morphological changes usually do not appear until ERG responses are dramatically reduced. Due to the strong reduction of photoreceptor responses in LEW/Ztm-ci2 animals of the VetSchool group we examined the eyes histologically. Three eyes of LEW/Ztm-ci2 rats and LEW/Ztm rats were looked at per group (MedSchool, VetSchool), 12 samples in total. All samples in LEW/Ztm-ci2 rats from the VetSchool group showed some degree of pathological alteration ranging from a diminution to a complete loss of the photoreceptor cell layer and the outer nuclear layer (Fig. 4 -B/C). Interestingly, the remaining cell layers (inner nuclear layer, inner and outer plexiform layers) and the retinal pigment epithelium appeared intact. In contrast, none of the LEW/Ztm-ci2 and LEW/Ztm rats of the MedSchool group showed any signs of photoreceptor degeneration (Fig. 4-A) .  Myo15 transcripts were detected in retinas by in situ hybridisation and by Real Time PCR  Retina sections of affected and unaffected LEW/Ztm-ci2 animals were hybridized with a 59-end digoxigenin-labeled probe that recognizes the Myo15 mRNA in a region not harboring the mutation. Myo15 transcripts were detected in the retinas of affected (Fig. 5) and unaffected animals. Probe binding was discovered in all retinal layers but to a higher degree in the Outer Plexiform Layer and in the Inner Photoreceptor Cell Layer.Myo15 mRNA was detected in retinas of LEW/Ztm rats by PCR techniques (Fig. 6 ).Differences in environmental conditions of both facilities (MedSchool/VetSchool) did not seem to disturb the vision LEW/Ztm-ci2 rats from two facilities display diverging eyephenotypes. As all animals originate from the same stock of an inbred strain the environmental conditions must be the cause for these disparities. Environmental factors certainly have the potential to cause retinal damage. Excessive light exposure, for example, can cause severe retinal degeneration, particularly in albino rats [30, 31] . The light intensity as well as the duration of light (enlarged light cycle) play a decisive role.Since unaffected control animals were housed along with affected LEW/Ztm-ci2 rats, the environmental factors alone cannot be responsible for the retinal phenotype of LEW/Ztm-ci2 rats. Nevertheless, all factors that have the potential to harm retinal structures were investigated in both facilities.Microbiological monitoring did not reveal an infection with common rat pathogens except for Staph. aureus, Pasteurella pneumotropica, Helicobacter sp. (MedSchool and VetSchool); Corynebacterium sp., Rat Parvo Virus (MedSchool); and Oxyura syphacica muris (VetSchool). Borna disease virus wasn't detected in either of the faculties. Furthermore, previous or acute infections were excluded by histological examination of the retinas and by blood tests.The light intensity measured in the middle of the animal room, in front of the cages and inside the cages, was for the most part comparable between facilities (Table 2) . However, the room of the VetSchool was illuminated in a very uneven way. The light intensity inside all cages ranged from 2 to 28 lux, however, 130 lux were observed in the top row of the female's rack in the room of the VetSchool.Additional environmental factors (such as diet, water supply, bedding, light cycle etc.) did not differ between both facilities.  Discussion  In this study we describe the first rat strain carrying a mutation in Myo15. Phenotypic features of homozygous LEW/Ztm-ci2 animals are deafness and spontaneous lateralized circling behavior combined with further motor abnormalities such as stargazing, locomotor hyperactivity and ataxia [1] . Previously, histological investigations were able to show that hair cells of the inner ear and the vestibular organs are damaged or lacking [2] . The mutation has been mapped to a region on rat chromosome 10, including strong candidate genes Myo15 and Kcnj12.Resequencing of these candidate genes revealed a base substitution (TRC) in exon 56 of Myo15 causing an amino acid exchange in the C-terminal MyTH4 domain of myosin XV. Myo15 transcript levels are comparable between mutant and wildtype animals, indicating that the protein function of myosin XV must be altered. According to the recommendations of the rat genome and nomenclature committee this model is now denominated LEW/Ztm-Myo15 ci2 rat.Recessive mutations in MYO15A are associated with the profound nonsyndromic hearing loss disorder (DFNB3) in humans [8, 9] . Previously described mutant allels of MYO15A are distributed across the length of the gene. A number of DFNB3 causing mutations have been identified and are mainly located in the motor region [8, 9] but also in the N-terminal MyTH4 and FERM domains of the protein's tail [32, 33] . Only recently a missense mutation (L3160F) in the C-terminal MyTH4 domain of myosin XV was detected in a Pakistani family. Although this mutation is located close to the circling-2 mutation the only symptom reported in humans is deafness [32] .The tail domains of myosin XV have several binding sites that interact with other proteins. The co-localization of the myosin XV and whirlin proteins is thought to be a key event for stereocilia elongation [34, 35] . The PDZ domain of whirlin binds to the C-terminal MyTH4-FERM region of myosin XV [34] . As this is the same myosin XV region where the circling-2 mutation occurred, we think it is possible that the binding site is affected.The mutation in the third PDZ domain of whirlin in humans causes the sensorineural deafness disorder (DFNB31). A homologous mutation in the whirlin gene (Whrn) in a mouse strain results in a phenotype very similar to that of the shaker-2 mice and circling-2 rats [36] [37] [38] [39] .Whirlin is part of a protein network performing several functions in neurosensory cells of the retina and the cochlea. It links proteins that are involved in the Usher syndrome, such as myosin VIIa, harmonin b, cadherin-23, protocadherin-15 and VLGR1b [40] . This Usher interactome participates in common pathways of the inner ear and the retina that are disrupted in the Usher syndrome [41] . However, the biochemical and structural mechanism governing the Usher protein complex formation remains largely unclear.Several rodent strains have been suggested as animal models for the human Usher syndrome (Subtype 1B), for example the shaker-1 mouse (STOCK Myo7a sh1 /J) and the tornado rat (Crl:WI-Myo7a tnd ), respectively. Both animal models show circling behavior, vestibular dysfunctions and profound deafness. However, blindness or progressive loss of vision and degeneration of the retina, as can be seen in USH1-patients, have not been described.So far, an involvement of myosin XV in the human Usher syndrome (USH) has not been established. However, myosin XV interacts with whirlin -a protein known to be involved in the Usher syndrome (USH2D). Whirlin plays a central role in the Usher protein network, which consists of at least nine different proteins [41, 42] . Since myosin XV is responsible for the transportation of whirlin in the inner ear, a similar function might be imaginable in the retina. To investigate the expression of myosin XV mRNA in the eye, a Real Time PCR and an in-situ hybridization were performed. Being able to demonstrate the expression of Myo15 mRNA in rat eyes for the first time we went ahead and examined whether the LEW/Ztm-Myo15 ci2 rat exhibits a retinal phenotype.Previous studies indicated that the visual system is affected in some of the LEW/Ztm-Myo15 ci2 rats (pers. comm., v. Hörsten). Electroretinographical and histological investigations revealed that the loss of function is caused by the degeneration of the retina (Fig. 2, 3) . We hypothesize that the mutant form of myosin XV in LEW/Ztm-Myo15 ci2 rats is not able to bind to its partner proteins (e.g. whirlin) in the retina and thereby reduces their functions.Interestingly, LEW/Ztm-Myo15 ci2 rats could be subdivided into two groups depending on housing: one susceptible to retinal damage and the other resistant.In the group housed in the VetSchool the incidence of a retinal phenotype was 100 percent. Histological evaluation revealed a degeneration of the retinas in the affected eyes. The RPE and the inner retina seemed to be totally unaffected, while the outer retina was almost completely disintegrated with only a few photoreceptor cell somata remaining. These findings are very similar to those revealed in a mouse model for Usher syndrome type 2A, described by Liu et al. 2007 [43] . In this mouse model, reduced ERG amplitudes and retinal degeneration were detected solely in aged animals. This finding has also been demonstrated in our LEW/ Ztm-Myo15 ci2 .Surprisingly, none of the LEW/Ztm-Myo15 ci2 animals of the MedSchool group showed any signs of impaired vision. Therefore, the question arose: Which factors could be responsible for inducing the retinal phenotype in LEW/Ztm-Myo15 ci2 rats?A new genetic defect can be excluded since all animals were born in the same breeding colony in the Central Animal Facility of Hannover Medical School and some even stem from the same breeding pair. The only difference between these animals was their environment. Since control animals, which were kept under the same environmental conditions did not show any signs of retinal impairment, the environmental factors alone could not be held responsible for the retinal phenotype in LEW/Ztm-Myo15 ci2 rats. Comparison of environmental conditions revealed some differ- ences between the two facilities but so far it has not been possible to pinpoint to any obvious factors affecting the animals' sight. Involvement of certain pathogens, e.g. coronavirus or Borna disease virus, has been reported in retinal degenerations [44, 45] and the rats were examined for the most important pathogens, however, none with relevance were detected. The light intensity was another factor that was closely watched since albino rats easily suffer retinal damages from increased light intensities. Therefore, the maximum light intensity for albino rat strains is recommended to be 60 lux (www.gv-solas.de/auss/hal/rattenhaltung.pdf). In the MedSchool the light intensity inside the cages ranged between 2 and 6 lux. In the VetSchool intensities of 6 to 28 lux were measured, with the exception of the top row of the female's rack where a light intensity of 130 lux was observed (Table 2) . Furthermore, in the animal room of the VetSchool the illumination was unbalanced, as part of the room was brighter than the rest. A correlation between the light intensity and severity of retinal degeneration was assumed as electroretinographical responses were slightly less in affected females than in males. However, functional or structural differences between animals kept in different rows and therefore at different light intensities were not observed. Since the impact of light intensities on the development of the retinal phenotype in LEW/Ztm-Myo15 ci2 rats remained unclear, this factor should be closely examined in further studies.Based on these observations, we assume that the susceptibility to impaired vision is mediated by the interaction of the mutated Myo15 gene, the genetic background and unknown environmental factors. The relevance of environmental factors for the development of retinal syndromes has been discussed for a long time. In the human Usher syndrome intrafamilial and interfamilial variations of retinal impairment have been reported, thereby indicating an involvement of genetic and non-genetic modifiers in disease expression [46] . A study by Liu et al. [47] indicates that even in humans clinical progression is influenced by environmental factors: monozygotic twins from an atypical USH family showed differences in the course of the disease and the severity of symptoms. Therefore, the varying phenotypes of humans, mice and rats harboring mutations in the C-terminal region of myosin XV might be due to different environmental conditions. Not only the retinal but also the vestibular phenotypes are absent in human patients.Results of our study might provide insights on the question why the retinal phenotype in USH-patients and in USH-animal models follow such a variable course of disease. Our results suggest that retina degeneration manifests in a mutation-environment combination, most likely only affecting older animals. Therefore, to investigate the retinal phenotype in models of the human Usher syndrome we suggest using older animals housed in diverse environmental conditions.In conclusion, the LEW/Ztm-Myo15 ci2 rat exhibits characteristic features of the human Usher syndrome. In contrast to most of established animal models for USH, the LEW/Ztm-Myo15 ci2 rat shows a retinal phenotype including photoreceptor degeneration, which is modified through currently unknown environmental factors. Consequently, this strain is an appropriate animal model for the investigation of the role of Myo15 in human Usher syndrome, particularly for the investigation of the interaction between the mutation and environmental factors in modifying retinopathy.   				1	1			
22481989	Accidental Chlorine Gas Intoxication: Evaluation of 39 Patients	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3311442/	BACKGROUND: Chlorine is a known pulmonary irritant gas that may cause acute damage in the respiratory system. In this paper, the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of 39 accidentally exposed patients to chlorine gas are reported and different emergency treatment modalities are also discussed. METHODS: Two emergency departments applications were retrospectively analyzed for evaluation of accidental chlorine gas exposure for year 2007. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to severity of clinical and laboratory findings based on the literature and duration of land of stay in the emergency department. The first group was slightly exposed (discharged within 6 hours), second group moderately exposed (treated and observed for 24 hours), and third group was severely exposed (hospitalized). Most of the patients were initially treated with a combination of humidified oxygen, corticosteroids, and bronchodilators. RESULTS: The average age was 17.03 ± 16.01 years (95% CI). Seven (17.9%) of them were female and 29 (74.4%) were children. Twenty-four patients (61.5%) were included in the first, nine (23.1%) were in second and six (15.4%) were in the third group. The presenting symptoms were cough, nausea, and vomiting and conjunctiva hyperemia for the first group, first groups symptoms plus dyspnea for the second group. Second groups symptoms plus palpitation, weakness and chest tightness were for the third group. Cough and dyspnea were seen in 64.1% and 30.8% of the patients respectively. No patients died. CONCLUSIONS: The authors recommend that non symptomatic or slightly exposed patients do not need any specific treatment or symptomatic treatment is sufficient. KEYWORDS: Accidental; Chlorine exposure; Chlorine gas; Chlorine intoxication; Emergency department	Introduction  Chlorine (Cl 2 ) is a yellow-green gas or boiling yellow liquid, slightly water soluble, and about two times heavier then air [1, 2] . It has a pungent, irritating odor and is a strong oxidizing agent [1, 2] . Chlorine releasing agents are frequently used for industrial, household chemicals and water purification in swimming pools or city water sources [2] [3] [4] .The risk of exposure to chlorine gas with large number of casualties is widespread, since chlorine is carried through densely populated areas in large quantities [3] . Inhalation exposure to chlorine can occur from inhalation of elemental Cl 2 or inspiration of vapors that contain chlorine releasing chemicals [4] [5] [6] [7] due to chemical transportation accidents [8, 9] , accidental explosions, leaks, or malfunction of chlorinedisinfection systems [7] , improper mixing of ammonia and hypochlorite bleach (forming chloramines gas) and school experiments [1, 8, 10] .The respiratory system is the most adversely affected of all organ systems by chlorine gas exposure [11] and complications are generally immediate with severe exposure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, pneumomediastinum and death [1, 8, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .In this paper, the social and demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory findings of patients which have been accidentally exposed to chlorine gas due to chlorine tank explosion in Southeast of Turkey are reported. Different treatment modalities in chlorine intoxication are also discussed.performed. Three of them are Ministry of Health Government Hospitals (one is Children's Hospital) and other is University Hospital. All hospitals' emergency departments (ED) medical records which explain above were retrospectively analyzed for evaluation of accidental chlorine exposure patients for year 2007.The authors determined totally 168 people who had been affected acutely by chlorine gas as a result of chlorine tank explosion that was used for city water source purification, and transferred to the hospitals in the city center. Among these, authors could reach only 39 patients' medical records (Twenty three patients transferred to Ministry of Health Children's, 16 to University Hospital EDs). The rest of 129 patients' medical records which transferred to other two hospitals' EDs were not able to reach because the reasons of can't get permission and file record insufficiency.The authors determined 39 patients' routine physical examinations were done at admission. Depending on the patient's clinical picture by the discretion of the physician, the necessary diagnostic tests (e.g. chest X-Ray (CXR)), complete blood counts, electrocardiograms (ECG), arterial blood gases (ABG), and consultations were ordered.The authors classified the patients into 3 groups according to clinical and laboratory findings based on the literature [1, 8, [12] [13] [14] 16] and duration of land of stay in the ED. First group was not affected at all or slightly exposed. These patients were principally mobile, they showed no vital or laboratory abnormalities. The main symptoms were mainly mild cough, nausea, weakness and burning in the eyes, and throat. They were completely treated and discharged from ED in less than 6 hours. The second group was moderately exposed. The main predictors of this group were mild pulmonary symptoms (as mild dyspnea and/or mild to moderate cough, and palpitation) and/or tachycardia and/or tachypnea (> 18 to ≤ 25 breath/per minute). But they had no pathologic pulmonary examination findings. This group of patients were treated and observed in ED for 6 to 24 hours. The third group was severely exposed. They had severe dyspnea, chest tightness or pain, wheezing, tachypnea (≥ 26 breath/minute), tachycardia and pathologic pulmonary physical examination findings such as crackles and/or ronki. All patients in the third group were hospitalized. Some of the patients in the second and third groups showed abnormal laboratory results.Most of the patients were initially treated with supplemental humidified oxygen (via nasal canulla or mask). Various combinations of parenteral fluids, metyl-prednisolone, antiemetics and/or H2 blockers, antibiotics and inhalational bronchodilators were used appropriately. None of the patients received nebulized sodium bicarbonate therapy.All the data that we have presented are mean ± SD and in percentages.  Results  Seven (17.9%) patients were females and 32 (82.1%) were males. The ages of the patients ranged between 2 and 66 years and the average age was 17.03 ± 16.01 (CI 95%). Twenty nine (74.4%) were children (ranging between 2 -16 years of age). Thirty two patients (82.1%) had no history of medical disease or smoking habit. However, 6 patients (12.8%) were smokers, one had history of hypertension, and one child (2 years old) had asthma history. Patient characteristics according to age groups are shown in Table 1 .The presenting symptoms were mostly associated with one another, including; cough (alone) (n = 7, 17.9%), cough and nausea (n = 5, 12.8%), cough and dyspnea (n = 5, 12.8%), and different associations of these with chest tightness, burning in eyes and in throat, conjunctival hyperemia, weakness and vomiting symptoms were found in 27 (69.2%) patients respectively. Cough and dyspnea were the most prevalent complaints among the patients and were seen in 64.1% and 30.8% of the patients respectively, in total. Twelve patients (30.8%) had no evident symptoms. In physical examination 25 patients (64.1%) were normal. Tachypnea was the dominant sign with 35.9% among the patients. Regarding the laboratory findings, 11 (28.2%) patients were assessed by CXR, 10 (25.6%) were assessed by ECG and 17 (43.6%) were assessed by ABG analyses. Most patients did not have an ECG, ABG or CXR performed. These tests were considered unnecessary for the patients who appeared well. Only one patient (2.6%) who used to be a smoker, showed pathologic findings in his chest radiograph (hyper-aeration, decrease in cardio-thoracic ratio, elevated diffuse reticular density). No ECG pathology was detected and 11 (28.2%) of ABG analyzes were abnormal. Eight (20.5%) patients, whose ABG analyzes were assessed as abnormal, had hypoxia. Four of these 8 patients were in the third group. Of these patients, one (2.6%) had respiratory alkalosis, while the rest three (7.7%) had hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis.The authors did not need to perform decontamination to any patient because chlorine is a volatile gas and there were no severe eye or skin contaminations in our series. No patients received nebulized sodium bicarbonate therapy.Among the patients who were evaluated in EDs, 24 (61.5%) patients were in the first group and they were discharged after initial examination and symptomatic treatment except 3 patients who refused any treatment except normal saline. Seven (17.8%) of the rest 21 patients in the first group received only humidified oxygen and metyl-prednisolone.Other 14 (36%) patients in the first group who accepted treatment were initially treated with supplemental humidified oxygen (via nasal canulla or mask), various combinations and doses of parenteral fluids (e.g. normal saline, 0.45 % saline + 5 % dextrose, and Isolyte P ® ), and metyl-prednisolone (1mg/kg, intravenously). Of these 14 patients, 2 received metoclopramide (alone, intravenously), 3 received ranitidine (alone, intravenously) another 3 received ranitidine and metoclopramide combination (intravenously), appropriately, in addition to the initial treatment.Nine (23.1%) patients were in the second group. In this group one patient received only humidified oxygen and metyl-prednisolone. Three patients were initially treated in the same way with the first group. In this group, in addition to initial treatment, one patient received inhaler salbutamol, 2 patients received ranitidine, and one patient received metoclopramide plus ranitidine and inhaler salbutamol combination. Another patient received initial treatment plus metoclopramide plus ranitidine and inhaler salbutamol combination and wide spectrum antibiotic (intravenously). They were all observed and discharged in 24 hours after application to ED.There were 6 (15.4%) patients in the third group who were severely exposed were hospitalized; 2 patients were admitted to the adult intensive care unit, 3 patients to the pediatric intensive care unite and 1 patient to the pulmonary medicine department. No patient was diagnosed as bronchitis, ARDS and/or acute lung edema. Invasive or non invasive airway support (as intubations, CPAP or BIPAP) was not necessary. All the patients in this group were initially treated as in the first group. Metoclopramide, ranitidine, inhaler salbutamol and antibiotic measure combination were also used appropriately. Only one patient received teophyline measure in addition to this combination. No patients died.  Discussion  Chlorine is a highly toxic gas well known for mortality and morbidity since its discovery in 1772 [16] . The basic mechanism of toxicity is related to the solubility of chlorine in the water, because elemental Cl 2 maintains equilibrium with hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in aqueous solution (Cl 2 + H 2 O↔HCl + HOCl) or (Cl 2 + H 2 O↔2 HCl + [O -] ) [4, 5] . These chemical end-products cause damage to cellular proteins, resulting in direct tissue injury [17] .The medical literature is replete, from household or swimming pool exposures to industrial or chemical transportation accident reports [2, 4, 6, 9, 12, [13] [14] [15] [16] . Most unintentional exposures occur in the industrial field [5, 9, 16] . Transportation mishaps can release large quantities of Cl 2 gas into the air and trigger mass disaster incidents that can affect large number of adults and children together [9, 18] . The wide availability of chlorinated compounds as household disinfectants and swimming pool chlorinators makes these agents potentially hazardous to a larger segment of the population, including children [4, [6] [7] [8] [9] .In most of the reports, patients' ages ranged similarly but pediatric population was not as crowded as in our series [9, 15, 19] . In a review of 216 patients who were exposed to chlorine gas, Mrvos et al [19] reported that they were between 12 and 81 years old. Also Guloglu et al [9] reported that population age range in their study was between 3 months and 75 years of age and 50.9% of the cases were children and adolescents. Agabiti et al [15] report was similar with Mrvos et al and Guloglu et al. They reported 282 patients and 134 (47.5%) were children.In the present study, children's population ratio is high because our data include the children who were transferred to Ministry of Health Children's Hospital. The main accident involved 129 more patients, mostly adults, transferred to other hospitals in the same city. Children/adult ratio would be different if all the victims were included in this study.Asthma, smoking habit, atopic persons and chronic exposure to chlorine gas were reported to be predisposing factors or conditions worsening the scene in many reports [8, 9, 11, 16, 18, 20] . In the presented series, there were only six smokers and one asthmatic child. Three of the smokers and the asthmatic child were admitted to intensive care unit but these patient numbers were not enough for evaluating these factors.The authors do not know how much chlorine gas was released into the atmosphere when the chlorine tank exploded.With considerable consistency around the world, chlorine has a time-weighted average exposure standard of 0.5-1 parts per million (ppm) [11] , but Evans [16] reported that doses below the 0.5 ppm can cause tickling of the nose and throat, itching of the nose and cough, burning of the eyes, and dryness of the throat. The fatal dose ranges from 50 to 2,000 ppm. Although, different chlorine gas exposure ratios can cause different complaints [16] .Evans [16] also reported that even upper airway exposure from chlorine inhalation was predominant. However, exposures to concentration greater than 15 ppm are typically associated with lower respiratory effects. The patients exposed to Cl 2 inhalation acutely, can appear in different range of clinical symptoms from fatal asphyxia or severe acute respiratory syndrome to slight injury such as simple irritation of the conjunctivae or nasal mucosa [1, 8, 12] . However, the lungs can also be permanently affected and clinically manifested as a chronic suppurative cough, complicated by wheezes and breathlessness of variable intensity [13, 14] .In many reports the most prevalent complaints of intoxication cases, as reported in Sexton and Pronchik's study [21] , were skin, eye and throat irritations including pruritus, lacrimation, rhino rhea, conjunctiva irritation, oropharyngeal pruritus and irritation, cough, sore throat, laryngeal edema, dyspnea, and sometimes hoarseness and stridor, headache, chest pain, and anxiety [3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12-15, 19, 22] . In our series most prevalent symptoms were cough (alone) and cough together with dyspnea. Cough and dyspnea mostly accompanied one another.Agabiti et al [15] reported that eye irritation was observed in 50.0%, nose and throat problems in 54.5%, and respiratory symptoms in 71.6% of the children in their study group. The corresponding values among adults were reported as 61.9, 73.0, and 66.7% respectively. Moulick et al [12] noted that 42% of the patients had eye irritation, 29.2% headache, 26.8% abdominal pain, and 24.3% vomiting. Guloglu et al [9] had found 60.4% dyspnea and 17% cough and dyspnea in their series.The authors did not find any skin or severe eye irritation in the patients. But respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms were similar with the literature.Physical examination following exposure to high concentrations may reveal decreased breath sounds, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxia, wheezing, crackles (ARDS/noncardiogenic pulmonary edema) and crepitation (associated with pneumomediastinum) [23] . In previous studies, Guloglu et al [9] reported that; 27.4% of their patients had expiratory wheezing, and only one had expiratory wheezing, cyanosis, tachycardia, and extrasystoles, 71.6% were normal. In our series, physical examination findings, normal patients' ratios, and results of ABG analyses were similar. However, ECG's, CXR findings were normal contrary to the literature.A baseline CXR should be obtained if the patient is symptomatic and respiratory functions should be monitored, including ABG and pulse oxymetry [17] . Chest radiographs can be normal, or they can sometimes show diffuse nodular opacities, patchy consolidation, pulmonary edema, and signs of vascular congestion. Radiographic abnormalities may appear late as lung injury develops and progresses. Persistent hyper reactivity and airflow obstruction may manifest radiographically as air trapping. The role of computerized tomography in evaluating lung injury is not established [24] . The priority in acute exposures to high doses of Cl 2 should be removal of person from the hazardous environment [5, 17, 25] . The goal of decontamination is to decrease further exposure to victims and to prevent secondary contamination of health care workers [26] . Immediate treatment of exposure, as with any toxic inhalation, should focus on the airway [25, 26] . Patient with significant ocular symptoms (e.g., pain, photo-phobia, and vision changes) should have their eyes irrigated with plenty of water or saline solution. The eyes should be examined for corneal abrasions [17, 26] . Also, for dermal injuries are caused by the caustic nature of the chlorine gas, contaminated clothing should be removed, followed by irrigation with plenty of water [5, 17, 26] .Guloglu et al [9] reported that they preferred and recommended humidified O 2 and ß agonist combination applications to be the supportive therapy in their study group because of trachea-bronchitis and broncho-constriction and/ or pulmonary edema and Reactive Airway Dysfunction Syndrome effects of chlorine gas. Treatment implication was same in Akdur et al [14] case report of a 26 years old woman who was diagnosed as pneumomediastinum due to chlorine intoxication. They also used methyl-prednisolone and death was not reported. In 282 cases reported by Agabiti et al [15] , intravenous cortisone and humidified O 2 were used in some cases, particularly in those admitted to hospital. No patient received nebulized sodium bicarbonate treatment.A few studies have used animal models, which involved systemic or inhaled corticosteroid administration treatment immediately following high-rate chlorine exposure. Gunnarsson et al [3] used a porcine model of Cl 2 inhalation and demonstrated that the immediate use of inhaled beclomethasone improved hypoxemia, pulmonary vascular resistance, and survival. In a similar study with ventilated pigs, Wang et al [27] reported that the timing of inhaled corticosteroids may be an important factor in the management of chlorine intoxication. The same authors [3, 27] demonstrated that the combination of an inhaled ß 2 agonist followed by a nebulized corticosteroid provided a greater improvement in Cl 2induced lung injury than the administration of each agent alone. The above studies showed improved pulmonary and cardiovascular function but no effect on mortality [3, 27] .Nebulized sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 ) has also been suggested as a therapy for chlorine exposure. The proposed mechanism of the action is the neutralization of the formed acids in the respiratory tissues. Cellular damage from oxy-gen free radical formation is not addressed by this therapy [17, 26, 28, 29] . Bosse GM [28] reported in his retrospective case review of nebulized NaHCO 3 treatment of chlorine intoxication that 45.58% of patients clearly improved after using of bicarbonate. But there are not enough animal experiments about nebulized NaHCO 3 therapy which will show the efficacy.Against all, Russell et al [30] reported that there was no specific antidote for the treatment of casualties caused by exposure to chlorine, phosgene, or mustard; therefore, management is largely supportive. He also reported that, clinical data on corticosteroid treatment efficacy, which has been given in casualties because of accidental exposure to chlorine; were inconclusive because of the numbers of patient were inefficient and the indications for administration were unclear. Similarly, Fleta et al. [13] reported that the criteria for administration of treatment are not clear and thus the efficacy of treatment can not be ascertained.Supplemental humidified oxygen, intravenous corticosteroids, bronchodilator combination and symptomatic supportive therapy were the main treatment choices in our series, similarly to the most of the literature. Applying too much steroids in our series can be a result of arbitrary decisions. Also, there is no scientific evidence for empiric use of antibiotics.Patients with acute lung injury and/or upper airway burns may require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Positive end expiratory pressure may be useful in enhancing oxygenation. Since pulmonary edema may be delayed, patients with significant symptoms should be admitted for observation and further symptomatic care for 24 hours. Asymptomatic patients may be discharged home with close follow up [17] .Based on published reports, most patients who are exposed to an isolated Cl 2 inhalation, recovered completely [16, 27] . However, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, obstructive disease, restrictive disease, ARDS, pneumomediastinum has been reported in survivors [1, 8, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .Evans [16] had reported in his review that the reasons of variable outcomes of individuals were high level exposure, minute ventilation, and host characteristics such as pre-existent asthma or ongoing smoking.In our series, in spite of different or arbitrary treatment modalities, there were no deaths and all patients' symptoms and physical examination findings were resolved. This result, in spite not being very explanatory, may be an effect of early systemic steroid treatment.  Study limitations  This study revealed the first most crowded accidental chlorine gas exposure in Turkey. Therefore authors could not find enough similar national study to compare. The patients were classified into three groups, but couldn't compare in term of determine the significant differences such variables as exposure rate and age groups, and exposure rate and gender, because the reasons of groups' having small patient number and don't have heterogeneity and number similarity among groups.Also, all patient treatments were not designed based on the literature, they were accepted completely arbitrary and authors could not classify the patients according to received treatments.The important part of patients didn't present for follow up because of socio-cultural reasons. This aspect affected our ability to gather information about long term prognosis. Furthermore, authors were not able to reach the patients' medical data, who presented to other Ministry of Health Government Hospitals. We are not also aware of patients who were thought to be normal and had not been transferred from the scene of the accident by EMS. All of these can be the important factors in statistical and outcome evaluation.  Conclusions  All exposed individuals in authors' study have shown complete resolution of their symptoms. The authors recommend that non symptomatic or slightly exposed patients do not need any treatment or may be treated symptomatically. Combined humidified oxygen and bronchodilators are still the best treatment option in addition to symptomatic supportive measures. Animal experiments which research efficacy of different agents and their combinations on chlorine toxicity are necessary.  								1
22973452	Human Anti-CCR4 Minibody Gene Transfer for the Treatment of Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3433438/	BACKGROUND: Although several therapeutic options have become available for patients with Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL), no therapy has been curative. Recent studies have demonstrated that CTCL cells overexpress the CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, a xenograft model of CTCL was established and a recombinant adeno-associated viral serotype 8 (AAV8) vector expressing a humanized single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-Fc fusion (scFvFc or “minibody”) of anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) h1567 was evaluated for curative treatment. Human CCR4(+) tumor-bearing mice treated once with intravenous infusion of AAV8 virions encoding the h1567 (AAV8-h1567) minibody showed anti-tumor activity in vivo and increased survival. The AAV8-h1567 minibody notably increased the number of tumor-infiltrating Ly-6G(+) FcγRIIIa(CD16A)(+) murine neutrophils in the tumor xenografts over that of AAV8-control minibody treated mice. Furthermore, in CCR4(+) tumor-bearing mice co-treated with AAV8-h1567 minibody and infused with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), marked tumor infiltration of human CD16A(+) CD56(+) NK cells was observed. The h1567 minibody also induced in vitro ADCC activity through both mouse neutrophils and human NK cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, our data demonstrate that the in vivo anti-tumor activity of h1567 minibody is mediated, at least in part, through CD16A(+) immune effector cell ADCC mechanisms. These data further demonstrate the utility of the AAV-minibody gene transfer system in the rapid evaluation of candidate anti-tumor mAbs and the potency of h1567 as a potential novel therapy for CTCL.	Introduction  Cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are a clinically heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative malignancies characterized by the clonal accumulation of mature and skin-homing memory T cells. Mycosis fungoides (MF), which is the most common and indolent form of CTCL, accounts for 50%-60% of CTCL cases [1] ; primary cutaneous CD30 + lymphoproliferative disorders, more specifically primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL) -the second most common CTCL, accounts for circa 30%; and Sézary syndrome, which is an aggressive leukemic variant of CTCL, affects approximately 5% of patients. These patients exhibit significant immune dysfunction [2, 3] because of the global dysregulation of T cells, which is due to an unknown etiology [4, 5] . Bacterial sepsis is the terminal event in most patients with advanced cancer. Current therapies for patients with advanced CTCL, including its leukemic variant, are only palliative, and extensive long-term remissions are rare. The poor 5-year survival rate of these patients receiving existing therapies clearly emphasizes the need for the development of new targeted therapies in this fatal disease [6] .Over the past few years, several studies have described the expression of chemokine receptors in the skin and blood of CTCL patients, including the uniformly high expression of CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) [7, 8, 9, 10] . CCR4 is highly expressed in both leukemic CTCL including Sézary syndrome and in MF, both in the very early stages (patch and plaque stages) of the disease and in large cell transformations [7, 8, 10, 11, 12] . It is also expressed on circa 60% of PC-ATCL cells [1] . In a recently published consensus article regarding the classification of CTCL, it is clear that CCR4 is expressed in the vast majority of CTCL cells, regardless of their histological subtype [1] . On the other hand, expression of CCR4 is limited amongst non-malignant cells [13] . It is not present on neutrophils, monocytes, or B cells [14] . It is absent on naïve T cells, and present on fewer than half of all memory T cells [15] . expression of CCR4 by tumor cells is associated with their skin involvement, CCR4 also has an important role in normal and tumor immunity [13, 14] . CCR4 is expressed at high levels on T regulatory cells (Tregs) that can migrate to tumor cells that secrete the CCR4 chemokines CCL17 and CCL21 to facilitate evasion from immune surveillance [16, 17] . High expression of the these CCR4 ligands has been detected in CTCL lesions [11] , breast cancer [16] , ovarian cancer [17] and oral squamous cell carcinoma [18] . Thus, targeted therapy against CCR4 may be an attractive treatment option for these malignancies, not only to directly kill the CCR4 + tumor cells, but also to overcome the suppressive effect of CCR4 + Tregs on the host antitumor immune response.Monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based immunotherapies have become the standard therapy in an increasing number of human cancers [19, 20] . Tumor targeting with a human mAb directed against tumor-associated markers, such as CCR4, might provide a powerful therapeutic strategy against CTCL. In this study, we used recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated antibody gene transfer into SCID-BEIGE mice to evaluate the effectiveness of h1567, a novel humanized anti-CCR4 mAb to inhibit CCR4 + tumor cell growth and increase survival. The CCR4-specific antibody gene was packaged into an AAV vector and then delivered by a single direct intravenous (i.v.) injection which leads to the endogenous synthesis and durable expression of therapeutic antibody levels for months. Intravenous delivery of this h1567 minibody-encoding AAV vector allowed for rapid and accurate assessment of its therapeutic potential, thereby avoiding ex vivo manipulations involved in the production and purification of therapeutic mAbs.In vivo studies using therapeutic mAb gene transfer after CCR4+ tumor cell implantation demonstrated the potent antitumor activity of the mAb h1567. In addition, the in vivo effector cells that mediate tumor cell killing through h1567 Fc binding to Fcc receptors, namely FccRIIIa (CD16A), were delineated. These studies suggest that mAb 1567 can serve as an effective antibodydirected therapy for immunodepleting malignant CTCL cells and may minimize collateral damage to the already compromised immune system. Furthermore, in the context of anti-cancer mAb therapies that require frequent and repeated administration, this AAV-based therapeutic antibody gene transfer strategy might serve as an alternative platform for their delivery.  Results  In vitro and in vivo Expression of AAV8-encoding Anti-CCR4 h1567 A modified scFvFc minibody format was used as the antibody moiety in the AAV8 vector, in which the V domains of heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains of the humanized scFv h1567 were fused to the coding region of the hinge and constant domains 2 and 3 (CH2 and CH3) of the human IgG1 heavy chain, to yield bivalent binding to the target molecule hCCR4 (Figure 1a ) (DK. Chang et al., in press). The resulting recombinant AAV8 vector was used for both in vitro protein synthesis and virus production for in vivo antibody gene delivery. In a pilot dosing study, nude mice received a single injection of two different concentrations of AAV8-h1567 via intravenous tail vein injection. Serum h1567 minibody levels were followed for 15 weeks. H1567 minibody levels rose for the first 2-3 weeks, reaching levels of circa 65 and 96 ug/ml for the low (0.8610 11 vg/mouse) and high (2.0610 11 vg/mouse) vector doses, respectively and then through the remaining weeks of the study leveled off at near peak levels for the high dosed vector and circa 1/3rd that level (,35 ug/ml) for the low dosed vector ( Figure S1 ). Because 2610 11 vg per mouse gave higher serum levels of h1567, this vector concentration was used in the subsequent in vivo studies.CCR4 + Mac-1 tumor cells grow well in SCID-BEIGE mice and therefore we established a SCID-BEIGE/Mac-1 xenograft tumor model to evaluate the efficacy of AAV8-h1567 therapeutic minibody gene transfer. In SCID-BEIGE mice treated with a single intravenous tail vein injection of the AAV8 vectors, a timedependent increase in serum concentrations of the control 11A and h1567 minibodies, reaching steady state levels of circa 50 ug/ ml after 7-14 days and remaining at those peak levels through day 28, the last day of the study ( Figure 1b) . The control 11A is a irrelevant minibody that is directed against SARS Spike protein [21] . To determine whether the AAV8-minibody transduction in vivo could result in production of properly folded scFvFc, protein A-purified minibodies recovered from serum of SCID-BEIGE mice three weeks following intravenous delivery of AAV8 vectors were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting. As shown in Figure 1c , when examined under reducing conditions, the 11A and h1567 minibodies recovered from both in vitro and in vivo sources showed bands at the expected size for scFvFc, circa 60 kD. Analysis under non-reducing conditions showed dimer formation (mol wt circa 120 kD), thereby confirming that the minibodies were divalent in vitro and in vivo ( Figure 1c ). In addition, the ease of recovery of the AAV8-derived minibodies from serum using affinity purification on protein A, their reactivity on Western blot with the anti-human Fc antibody, and their stable dimer formation confirms the proper folding and structural integrity of their CH2-CH3 domains (Figure 1c and 1d ).Binding Activity of h1567 Minibody in Serum Following AAV8-mediated Gene TransferTo determine the functional integrity of the AAV8-derived scFvFc minibodies, sera obtained from mice 14 days after in vivo AAV8 transduction were examined for the level of binding to CCR4 by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 1e , the secreted h1567 minibody in the mouse serum could specifically bind to the CCR4 + Mac-1 cells and CCR4 + 293T cells but not to parental 293T cells, indicating that the scFv domain was correctly folded and that it retained full antigen-binding activity. Irrelevant 11A minibody, which served as a negative control, did not bind to CCR4-expressing cells.  Treatment of Pre-established Tumor-bearing Mice with AAV8-h1567  The therapeutic effects of AAV8-h1567 gene transfer were next evaluated in vivo in SCID-BEIGE mice that carried subcutaneously implanted Mac-1 tumor xenografts. Groups of 4 mice were given a single intravenous injection of AAV8-h1567 or control AAV8-11A vector on day 7 after tumor inoculation and tumor volume was assessed twice weekly. As shown in Figure 2a , a single injection of AAV8-h1567 resulted in significantly reduced tumor growth compared with AAV8-11A treated mice or PBS control treated mice (P,0.01 at day 18, P,0.0005 at day 21). Mouse survival was monitored for up to 2 months. Tumor-bearing mice treated with AAV8-h1567 significantly outlived (P,0.005) mice treated with AAV8-11A or untreated mice ( Figure 2b ).  Mechanisms of Tumor Cell Killing by h1567 in SCID-BEIGE Mice  Since SCID-BEIGE mice lack T and B lymphocytes as well as functional natural killer (NK) cells, it is possible that the CCR4 + Mac-1 tumor cells were eliminated by h1567 through neutrophildependent ADCC as neutrophils are intact in SCID-BEIGE mice and they express FccRIIIA receptors which have been shown to mediated ADCC [22, 23] . Tumor sections were excised 21 days after AAV8 gene transfer and analyzed histologically for expression of Ly6G, a member of the Ly-6 family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins expressed on murine neutrophils [24, 25] . Immunostaining of tumors sections with neutrophil-specific Ly-6G mAb confirmed infiltration of neutrophils into tumors treated with AAV8-h1567 (Figure 2c , upper-left and middle panels) but not with AAV8-11A (Figure 2c , lower-left and right panels). Quantification of the neutrophil infiltration demonstrated a marked accumulation of Ly-6G+ staining cells only in the h1567 treated mice (Figure 2d) .To further assess the h1567-mediated, mouse neutrophildependent tumor cell killing, in vitro ADCC assay was carried out using purified SCID-BEIGE mouse neutrophils and h1567 minibody. Coculturing Mac-1 cells with mouse neutrophils in the presence of h1567 at the effector to target ratio of 80:1 resulted in significant neutrophil-mediated ADCC as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from Mac-1 cell (Figure 2e ). Control 11A minibody was not able to induce neutrophilmediated cytotoxicity. These in vitro results correlate with the observed anti-tumor activity in vivo and suggest that the antitumor activity of the h1567 minibody in this CTCL murine model is mediated, at least in part, through Fcc receptor IIIA (CD16A) engagement on mouse neutrophils to induce ADCC effector functions.  Mechanism(s) of h1567 in vivo Tumor Killing in Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC)-engrafted Mice Bearing Pre-established CCR4-positive Tumors  The therapeutic CTCL model was further extended to evaluate the role of human effector cells in tumor cell killing using bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of luciferase expressing CCR4 + Mac-1 cells established by retroviral transduction. Ten SCID-BEIGE mice that were grafted with 1610 6 CCR4 + Mac-1 cells and developed equivalent sized tumors as detected on day 7 by BLI were divided into two groups. Eleven days after initial tumor cell inoculation, the AAV8-minibody vectors were administered intravenously. Next, human PBMCs (hPBMCs) were given by intraperitoneal injection 7 days after AAV vector administration. As shown in Figure 3a , treatment with AAV8-h1567 and hPBMCs resulted in substantial tumor growth inhibition compared to AAV8-11A plus hPBMC treated mice. Quantitative monitoring of tumor growth by in vivo BLI correlated with visible tumor growth, further confirming the tumor growth inhibition effect of AAV8-h1567 compared with control group (Figure 3b) . A significant difference was observed between the control AAV8-11A and therapeutic AAV8-h1567 groups on days 40, 42, and 45 after tumor inoculation by caliper measurement and by days 25 and 38 by BLI (Figure 3a and b) . Real-time whole-body BLI of a representative mouse showed that tumor growth was considerably inhibited in mice treated with AAV8-h1567 compared with control mice over the treatment period ( Figure 3c) . Analysis of micro-computed tomography/positron emission tomography (mCT/PET) images also revealed tumor growth inhibition with AAV8-h1567 treatment compared with the control group. While both AAV8-h1567 and AAV8-11A showed primary tumor growth 28 days after tumor inoculation, the tumor cells became much more locally invasive in the AAV8-11A treated group and showed increased metabolic activity as indicated by the accumulation of the PET tracer 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in whole-body images of mice (Figure 3d) .To further assess the in vivo mechanisms of tumor cell killing in the AAV8-h1567 plus human PBMC treated group, the role of human NK cells, which also express FccRIIIA receptors, was evaluated. In the AAV8-h1567 treatment group, a substantial increase in tumor-infiltrating human NK cells was observed, as shown by the intense CD56 immunostaining compared with control 11A treated mice (Figure 4a) . Quantitative color deconvolution analysis showed a significantly increased staining in the mouse group treated with AAV8-h1567 compared with the control group treated with AAV8-11A (P,0.01; Figure 4b ).Human NK cell-mediated ADCC activity was also evaluated in vitro using purified human NK cells as effector cells. As shown in Figure 4c , human NK cells were able to kill Mac-1 target cells in the presence of h1567 in a dose dependent fashion. Control 11A minibody showed only very low levels of killing. As both mouse neutrophils and human NK cells express FccRIIIA receptors (CD16A) on their surface that can bind h1567, these in vitro and in vivo data strongly support that h1567 mediated killing occurs, at least in part, through FccRIIIA engagement and activation of immune cell effector functions.  Discussion  In this study, an AAV8-based therapeutic antibody gene transfer model was developed to evaluate a novel humanized anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody h1567 as a therapeutic drug candidate against CTCL. The SCID-BEIGE mice that were used to establish this CTCL model lack T and B cells and functional NK cells [26] . High level, durable expression of the h1567 minibody was achieved after a single intravenous injection and significant anti-tumor activity against CCR4 + Mac-1 cells was seen in two animal treatment studies. These results provide the first in vivo evidence that mAb h1567 may be clinically active against CTCL cells and suggest that further studies should be undertaken to investigate its clinical efficacy.Remarkable among the findings of this study is that a single intravenous tail vein treatment with AAV8-h1567 minibody resulted in a dose dependent increase in serum minibody levels that steadily increased over a two week period and remained at near peak levels through the end of this 15 week study ( Figure S1 , Figure 1b ). The integrity of the minibodies was demonstrated biochemically in vitro and in vivo by several parameters including their CCR4 + binding activity, stable dimer formation and ease of recovery by protein A chromatography ( Figure 1 c and 1d) . This scFvFc minibody format may be ideal for experimental AAV8 delivery since conventional mAb expression is derived from heavy and light chain genes, and it can be difficult to achieve the balanced expression of two genes within a single AAV vector that has a small packaging capacity (less than 5 kb), although a 2A selfprocessing peptide and furin cleavage have been successfully used to drive the expression of full-length rat IgG [27, 28] . For cancer immunotherapy, scFvFc minibodies appear to be promising because they have been shown to be functionally comparable with full-length IgG and have been successfully used to treat various tumors in preclinical studies [29, 30, 31] . As an added benefit, along with their bivalent antigen-binding avidity and intact antibody effector functions, they comprise a single polypeptide chain that does not require balanced heavy and light antibody chain heterocomplex associations and have a smaller molecular weight for better tissue penetration compared with whole IgG molecules [32] .The functional integrity of the h1567 minibody was also shown by its potent in vivo anti-tumor and in vitro killing activities. In the first treatment study (model 1), marked inhibition of Mac-1 tumor cell growth and increased survival was seen (Figure 2a and b ) even though these SCID-BEIGE mice have profound immune cell defects including lack of T and B cells as well as impaired macrophage and NK cell effector functions [26] . Further IHC staining of the paraffin-embedded tumor tissues revealed a predominant infiltration of Ly-6G + CD16A + neutrophils only in the h1567 minibody but not control 11A minibody treated mice (Figure 2c) . Furthermore, in vitro ADCC assay using purified mouse neutrophils as an effector cells demonstrated that h1567 induced significant lysis of CCR4 + Mac-1 cells, while no lysis was seen with 11A ( Figure 2e) . These results support the view that neutrophil-mediated ADCC is involved in anti-tumor activities following AAV8-h1567 gene delivery in the SCID-BEIGE CTCL mouse model.The therapeutic SCID-BEIGE CTCL model was further extended to evaluate the role of human effector cells in tumor cell killing. In the second treatment study (model 2), AAV8-h1567 gene delivery together with human PBMCs was evaluated and a significant inhibition of CCR4 + Mac-1 tumor cell growth was again seen (Figure 3) . The therapeutic effect of the h1567 was monitored using tumor size measurements and BLI. In comparison with the measurement of tumor volume, BLI analysis enabled earlier tumor detection and revealed extensive cell death in response to h1567 treatment (Figure 3c ). The addition of microPET and CT images provided three-dimensional analysis of the primary tumor and further evaluation of the effectiveness of the AAV8-h1567 treatment in vivo. PET imaging indicated invasive tumor cell infiltration into surrounding tissues which was not seen in the h1567 treated mice (Figure 3d) .The FccRIIIA receptor (CD16A) is the dominant FccR involved in human NK cell-mediated ADCC. Treatment of CCR4 + Mac-1 tumor bearing mice with AAV8-h1567 and human PBMCs resulted in a marked increase in the number of tumorinfiltrating human CD56 + NK cells, suggesting that CD16A which is expressed on human NK cells is involved in this tumor cell killing through it's interaction with the Fc portion of h1567, a finding that has been experimentally confirmed through Fc mutagenesis studies (data not shown). Moreover, in vitro ADCC studies with purified human NK cells demonstrated a concentration dependent killing by h1567 (Figure 4c) . Thus the unifying observations from both treatment studies strongly suggest that the in vivo anti-tumor activity of h1567 is mediated, at least in large part, by ADCC through engagement of FccRIIIA on mouse neutrophils (model 1) and human NK cells (model 2). Since Fc gamma receptors (FccRs) of different types are present on a variety of effector cell populations, including NK cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils [33, 34] , it is possible that FccR engagement on other immune effector cells, not investigated in this study could also be involved.MAb therapy for advanced CTCL has been proposed [3] and numerous trials with alemtuzumab (anti-CD52) have shown modest to moderate clinical effects [35, 36, 37] . A recent trial with low dose alemtuzumab has shown complete remission in 50% of patients with refractory leukemic forms of the disease and without infectious disease complications although it was found completely ineffective in the treatment of MF [6] . A mAb to CD4 (GenMab) has been designated an orphan drug for the treatment of MF by the FDA [38] . While both approaches are designed to eliminate CTCL cells, there can be significant adverse effects from either treatment. CD52 is expressed by virtually all T and B cells, and the elimination of all CD4-positive cells has well-known negative consequences [39] . Clonal malignant T cells in these CTCL patients express uniformly high levels of CCR4, but variable to low levels of other skin homing addressins, including CLA, CCR10 and CCR6. CCR7, which is also uniformly highly expressed on leukemic variants of CTCL with T CM phenotype, is not expressed on the phenotypic T EM cells that are found in MF skin lesions [7] . Thus, only CCR4 is uniformly expressed on all forms of CTCL and has a restricted expression pattern on normal T cells, including Tregs [40] . Indeed, a subset of malignant T cells in some CTCL have been shown to act as CCR4 + Tregs to suppress antitumor responses and may fuel disease progression [41] . A therapeutic mAb that could preferentially target all forms of the disease and reverse Treg mediated immune suppression would be a major advance in the effective therapy of CTCL. The activity of mAb1567 in abrogating Treg mediated suppression of T effector cell function is described elsewhere (DK. Chang et al., in press). MAb KM0761, is another humanized anti-CCR4 mAb that has shown promising results in CTCL animal studies [42] and in clinical trials for refractory Adult T-cell leukemia (ATLL) and peripheral T cell lymphoma (PLCL) where good clinical activity without severe adverse side effects was seen [43, 44] . Our data support further exploration of the clinical potential of therapeutic mAbs that target CCR4 in CTCL.In summary, the results of the present study have validated the utility of an AAV8-based therapeutic minibody gene transfer platform for the rapid experimental evaluation of mAbs for the treatment of human cancer. Furthermore, this study showed that the AAV8-h1567 minibody inhibited the primary CCR4 + tumor burden, suppressed local metastasis and prolonged the survival time in tumor-bearing SCID-BEIGE mice. We remain hopeful that additional studies will support this humanized mAb1567 moving from bench to bedside.   Cells  The human skin-tropic Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell line Mac-1, which was originally isolated in the laboratory of Marshall E. Kadin at Harvard Medical School [45] , was cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.06 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 500 mg/ml G418. Immunophenotyping of the Mac-1 cell line showed the expression of all known tumor-specific chemokine receptors, including high levels of CCR4, CCR7, and CXCR4. This MAC-1 cell line was stably transduced with a luciferase encoding retrovirus. HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). All cells and cultures were maintained at 37uC in a 5% CO 2 humidified incubator. Human PBMCs obtained from the Dana-Farber Blood Center were purified by a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation as described in the general protocol of Miltenyi Biotec Inc. (Auburn, CA). Mouse neutrophils were isolated from SCID-BEIGE mouse blood by Percoll density gradient centrifugation, as described [46] . Human NK cells were isolated from human PBMC using the NK cell isolation kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Miltenyi Biotec, CA).  Construction of AAV8 Vector Encoding anti-CCR4 Humanized scFvFc h1567 mAb  To construct the scFvFc h1567 minibody expression cassette, the scFvFc h1567 gene was PCR-amplified from a plasmid coding for the humanized anti-human CCR4 antibody that is derived from heavy and light antibody chains of mAb 1567 (R&D Systems, Inc) previously cloned in our laboratory (DK. Chang et al., in press) and inserted into the AAV-cloning vector pTRUF (obtained from the University of Iowa Viral Vector Core) at the restriction sites of Sfi1 and Not1. Consequently, to efficiently direct the expression and secretion of the single chain mAb, the pTRUF vector was modified by inserting the human IgG VH4 leader sequence and the Fc sequence (hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains) of the human IgG1 flanked by 145-bp and AAV2-inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) (Figure 1a ).  Viral Vector Production  Recombinant AAV8 viral vectors were produced using a helper virus-free system with some modifications [47] . Low-passage human HEK 293 cells were cotransfected by linear polyethylenimine (Polysciences) with three plasmids: the AAV cis-plasmid pTRUF encoding the human mAb gene expression cassette flanked with ITRs; the AAV-packaging plasmid p5e18 (2/8) containing AAV2 rep and AV8 cap genes; and the Ad helper plasmid pXX6-80 containing the VA RNA, E2, and E4 genes required for AAV propagation (obtained from Dr. Jim Wilson, University of Pennsylvania) [48] . At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested, and the AAV virus extracted by freezing and thawing the cells. Subsequently, AAV was purified by two sequential iodixanol density gradients, concentrated, then desalted by centrifugation through Biomax 100-K filters (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Viral titers were determined as genome copy titers (vg), by quantitative real-time PCR using primers and probe speicific for AAV vector pTRUF [49] . Forward primer (59-TCTGAGTAGGTGTCATTC-TATTCTGGG-39) is located at the end of the 39-poly(A), and reverse primer (59-CACTAGGGGTTCCTAGATCTCTCCC-39) is at the beginning of the 39 inverted terminal repeat (ITR). The probe (59-TCTTCCCAATCCTCCCCCTTGCTGTC-3; FAM/TAMRA) is located in between.Larger quantity of the AAV serotype 8 vectors encoding scFvFc 11A, control minibody specific for SARS [21] , and scFvFc h1567 were produced at Harvard Gene Therapy Initiative (Harvard Institute of Medicine, Boston, MA) and used in the animal studies.   Optical Imaging  Mice were monitored for tumor development and progression by both caliber measurement and Xenogen BLI. The latter was initiated for the monitoring of tumor growth 7 days after tumor implantation, which was repeated once a week. Mice were anesthetized with 3.5% isoflurane in an induction chamber, which was followed by the intraperitoneal administration of 50 mg/ml D-luciferin. For imaging, mice were maintained under 1.5% isoflurane anesthesia that was delivered through a nose cone. Whole body images were repeatedly acquired until the maximum peak of photon number was confirmed during various exposure times (10 s-1 min). Data were quantified using the time point that gave the highest photon number during the scanning time and analyzed using the Living Imaging software (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA).  CT/PET Imaging  PET/CT scans were performed at the Harvard Medical School Imaging Core Facility. Mice were fasted for 12 h before the 18 F-FDG injections, but provided water ad libitum. For 18 F-FDG injection and imaging, mice were anesthetized using 2% isoflurane. The animals were then intraperitoneally injected with 7.4 MBq (200 mCi) of 18 F-FDG, allowed to regain consciousness, and then kept at 37uC until imaging. Imaging was started 30 min after the intraperitoneal injection. Mice were imaged in a chamber that minimized positioning errors between PET and CT to less than 1 mm. Image acquisition time was 10 min. Images were analyzed using AMIDE software [50] . All regions of interest were defined on fused PET/CT images to ensure reproducible positioning.  Protein Expression and Purification  HEK 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were transfected with the AAV-coding plasmid containing the minibody-expressing constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Three days after transfection, the minibodies were purified from the supernatants with protein A sepharose affinity chromatography. The in vivo production of AAV8-minibodies was generated by i.v. injections into SCID-BEIGE mice as described above. Levels of minibodies in the serum were measured in duplicate using a human IgG ELISA quantitation kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, TX).  Western Blot Analysis  Western immunoblotting was performed on protein A column purified samples containing in vitro synthesized minibodies and in vivo AAV8-derived minibodies. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions and electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using the iBLot dry blotting system (Invitrogen). After blocking with 5% skim milk overnight, the blot was probed with an APconjugated human IgG-Fc antibody that was diluted 1:30,000 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Excess conjugate was removed by five washes with Phosphate buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). The detection of protein was performed by incubating the membrane with BCIP/NBT alkaline phosphatase substrate (KPL).  Flow Cytometry Analysis  The biological activity of the in vivo AAV8-derived h1567 minbodies was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for binding activity. Mac-1 cells or 293T-CCR4 cells were washed with PBS supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (PBS-B) and then incubated with in vivo produced h1567 for 1 h at room temperature, which was followed by incubation with antihuman IgG-Fc conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Flow cytometric analysis was performed using BD FacsCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and FlowJo data analysis software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR).  Immunohistochemistry and Quantification of Cell Staining  Immunohistochemical staining was performed at DFCI/Harvard Cancer Center Research Pathology Core. For qualitative and quantitative immunohistochemical analysis, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained with antibodies directed against Ly-6G on the surface of mouse neutrophils and human CD56 antigen on human NK cells. The stained slides were then scanned using the Aperio ImageScope (Aperio Technologies, Inc., Vista, CA), and full tumor sections were selected for quantitative analyses. The percentage of positively stained cells in the entire tumor sections was calculated using a color deconvolution algorithm.In vitro Antibody-dependent Cell Cytotoxicity Assay ADCC was performed using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay method, according to the CytoTox96 non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay procedure specified by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). Mouse neutrophils purified from SCID-BEIGE mouse or purified human NK cells from PBMC was used as effector cells and CCR4+ Mac1 tumor cells were used as target cells. Briefly, purified SCID-BEIGE mouse neutrophils or NK cells were plated at a density of 1610 4 cells per well in a roundbottom 96-well plate in the presence of h1567 or 11A minibodies.After 1 h of incubation, freshly prepared effector cells were added at an effector-target cell ratio (E:T) of 80:1 (mouse neutrophils) or 2:1 (human NK cells). After 2 h incubation at 37uC, supernatants of each well were recovered by centrifugation at 3006g for 5 min. LDH activity in the supernatant was determined by measuring absorbance at a wavelength of 490 nm. The cytotoxicity (%) was calculated according to the following formula:where E is the LDH release by effector-target coculture, SE the spontaneous release of the LDH from the effector cells, ST the spontaneous release of the LDH from the target cells and M the maximum release of the LDH from the target cells incubated with lysis solution (10% Triton-X). All measurements were done in triplicate.  Statistical Analysis  Statistical analyses were performed using 2-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc tests and unpaired 2-tailed t-tests using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Figure S1 Dose dependent expression of h1567 anti-CCR4 minibody.

23362418	Key Findings and Lessons from an Evaluation of the Rockefeller Foundation's Disease Surveillance Networks Initiative	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3557955/		  T he Rockefeller Foundation has a long history of providing support for disease surveillance in Asia, globally, and more recently in Africa (1Á3). Most recently, from 2007Á2012, the Foundation provided $22 million in support for the Disease Surveillance Networks (DSN) Initiative with the goal of contributing to the mitigation of disease outbreaks by supporting transnational and inter-disciplinary networks aimed at strengthening national, regional, and global disease surveillance and response systems. Specifically, the DSN Initiative aimed to build individual and institutional capacity to conduct disease surveillance and response efficiently and effectively; build bridges between disease surveillance networks and international agencies to increase the effectiveness of global response systems; and strengthen connections between animal health, human health, and environmental health through a ''One Health'' approach.The underlying hypothesis of the Initiative was that robust trans-boundary, multi-sectoral and crossdisciplinary collaborative networks lead to improved disease surveillance and response. In 2009Á2010, the Rockefeller Foundation undertook an independent evaluation of the Initiative, with a focus on the Mekong Region in Asia, Eastern and Southern Africa, and with global partners involved in the Initiative. Evaluation teams led by the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Tropical Medicine and Public Health Network (SEAMEO TropMed), the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute and African Public Health Research Centre, and the University of Washington assessed the validity of the underlying hypothesis and sought evidence of achievements, challenges, and lessons related to DSN formation and sustainability, capacity, tools, and transdisciplinary approaches (Text Box 1). Evaluation teams collected different types of data: (i) through field visits and interviews with key stakeholders; (ii) from a detailed analysis of Foundation portfolio grants; and (iii) through an innovative network analysis of the growth and connectivity of regional and global networks.Text Box 1. Intended outcomes of the Rockefeller Foundation support to the Disease Surveillance Networks (DSN) Initiative Outcome 1: Networks: Trans-boundary disease surveillance networks in Southeast Asia, and in Eastern and Southern Africa are formed, sustained, and evolve in order to enable disease surveillance practitioners to collaborate, share information, and learn how to more effectively address disease threats. Outcome 2: Capacity: Disease surveillance practitioners and their institutions strengthen, apply, and distribute technical and communication skills in disease surveillance to more effectively address disease threats. Outcome 3: Tools: Disease surveillance practitioners have access to Á and use Áimproved tools and methods to effectively and efficiently monitor, share and report information; and respond to disease threats. Outcome 4: Transdisciplinary Leadership in One Health: Policy makers, human health and veterinary practitioners take a trans-disciplinary approach to policy and practice in animal and human health while emphasizing ''One Health'' principles at global, regional and local levels. In commissioning the independent evaluation, the Foundation was interested in knowing whether the Foundation's work in disease surveillance was relevant to current global and regional trends and challenges in disease surveillance; whether it was efficiently and effectively used to improve skills and capacity for early detection and response; whether it was helpful to containing infectious disease outbreaks, thereby saving lives and livelihoods; and whether it is sustainable in the longer term.This article discusses key findings of the evaluation and implications for those involved in strengthening the field of disease surveillance. The evaluation represents the only formal set of evaluations conducted thus far on any of the Connecting Organizations for Regional Disease Surveillance (CORDS) networks.  Evidence of Achievements  Evidence collected during the evaluation indicates that the Initiative made great progress towards achieving its intended outcomes. Very broadly, with its partners, the Initiative provided vision and support that helped to establish new fields of practice in One Health, as well as global health diplomacy; built substantial capacity through targeted high quality grantee support; and fostered trust among key stakeholders. These efforts were facilitated by the generation of new knowledge in the application of networking to promote global health and in the governance of sub-regional networks; and by the elaboration and adoption of innovative Information Technology (IT) tools for surveillance and response. Specific findings are described below.Effectiveness and Sustainability of the Networks (Intended Outcome 1) The evaluators found conclusive and compelling evidence that effective and sustainable disease surveillance networks have been well established in Asia (notably the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance [MBDS] network) (4) and that promising networks are emerging in Africa (5Á6). Field visit and interview data indicate that networks supported by the Rockefeller Foundation DSN Initiative work have demonstrated effectiveness in reporting and containing outbreaks such as dengue, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and influenza. Stakeholders on every level validated the relevance and utility of the networked approach to disease surveillance. The regional network structure is seen as one that promotes the sharing of knowledge, resources, and best practices and thereby improves country-level efficiency in adopting effective surveillance and response systems. Network structures are also seen as a way of distributing capacity and assuring timely access to technical capacity in resource poor settings. Finally, they are seen as a way to build deeper and more extensive global, regional, and local ties between disease surveillance organizations and countries. These ties not only increase access to knowledge sharing, but they also create new pathways for the flow of critical information. Major factors driving the success of regional DSNs in Asia and Africa include: trust; transparency; a cooperative spirit; and partners with a sustained vision of a strong informal network. Government ownership, leadership and political will are also essential for success.As shown in Figs. 1 and 2 , a systematic network mapping analysis of the DSN Initiative presence in the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Global Outbreak and Alert Response Network (GOARN) shows that a small number of DSN grantees act as hubs in the larger network, connecting dozens of organizations to the global disease surveillance community and forming additional connections between organizations and countries already represented. In addition, many countries with minimal network representation benefit from organizational ties with DSN grantees. Fig. 1 shows individual disease surveillance grantees of the Rockefeller Foundation DSN Initiative prior to their involvement with the Initiative, with grantees not being well connected either to GOARN or to existing regional networks. Fig. 2 shows the growing connectedness between Initiative grantees and other organizations and countries. With Initiative support, grantees are connected both geographically and thematically with key players in disease surveillance at the global, regional, and local levels.Not only has connectedness increased, but also critical networks at local and regional levels have become stronger as a result of the DSN Initiative. Border crossings are considered the most critical areas for containing the spread of highly infectious diseases and pandemics from country to country. Yet, they are often the most isolated and with least capacity in the whole disease surveillance system. As shown in Fig. 3 , from 2004 to 2010, local cross-border surveillance sites in the six countries of the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS) network increased from four to 24, covering most of the critical trade routes (4).  New Capacity (Intended Outcome 2)  A second intended outcome of the DSN Initiative was to build capacity to more effectively address infectious disease threats. Portfolio, field visit, and interview data indicate that the Initiative supported activities that contributed positively and substantively to building individual, institutional, and network capacity in epidemiology, surveillance, and outbreak investigation and response. Specifically, the Initiative supported the provision and, with local partners, development of training, thought leadership, curricula, tools, technical support, and forums for learning, sharing, and developing knowledge and best practices. Additionally, Initiative support has facilitated substantial interaction not only among different networks, but also among different sectors (e.g., animal and human health, livestock, agriculture, transportation, security, immigration). For example, MBDS is cited by network participants, peers, and partners as being fundamental in promoting the sharing of knowledge, resources, and best practices to improve the Mekong countries' surveillance and response systems. As another example, the East Africa Integrated Disease Surveillance Network (EAIDSNet) and Southern African Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance (SACIDS) are jointly testing mobile phone surveillance tools (See Text Box 2 in [6] ).  New Tools (Intended Outcome 3)  Grantees of the DSN Initiative asked for, helped to develop, and piloted a wide range of new and innovative tools for real time transmission of clinical observations and expert advice using mobile technologies, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and web-based platforms. While most tools were well received and proved to be useful, some need more time for integration because of varying technical and cultural practices.  Transdisciplinary Leadership in One Health (Intended Outcome 4)  The inclusion of One Health as a central focus of the Initiative was perceived to be highly relevant to the challenges in the field of disease surveillance, especially given that the animal and human health disciplines have operated in silos for decades. The One Health concept is now widely known by local, regional, and global practitioners and has received funding from other major donors (e.g., U.S. agencies, the Asia Pacific Emerging Disease Framework [APSED] and other WHO regional frameworks) as a result of extensive efforts by Initiative partners and grantees to communicate the concept and its practical application. For example, the recent USAID Emerging Pandemic Threats Program fund of $400 million is built directly on the work of Initiative grantees and their partners (7) .  Overall Impact  The evaluators concluded that the Initiative has had significant impact on the field of disease surveillance policy and practice at both regional and global levels, particularly through its support of regional networks in Asia and through its early application of One Health principles in Africa and worldwide. In Asia, the Initiative contributed significantly to containing outbreaks in the Mekong Basin countries by supporting changes at the provincial, district, and village levels that helped to prevent the spread of several different outbreaks at different times and in different locations, saving lives and lessening the negative impact on the livelihoods of some of the world's poorest people. The Initiative has ensured its continued relevance at both regional and global levels not only by being an early adopter of the One Health perspective, but also by listening to its partners and network members, shifting its focus over time in response to changing needs and trends in human/animal health, and embracing the growing need for health diplomacy.Initiative grantees' policy reach extends beyond One Health. The regional disease surveillance networks supported by the Initiative and described in this supplement have become key players in developing a wide range of regional and global policies and in the collaborative implementation of those policies. For example, the Asian Development Bank modeled its Greater Mekong investments on Initiative work. Some of this reach can be credited to the Rockefeller Foundation's long history of work in the field of public health and its credibility and perceived leadership among development partners in linking theory, research, policy, and practice. Indeed, it was the Foundation's history of work in public health that served as a solid rationale for its involvement in the DSN Initiative.  Challenges for the Rockefeller Foundation  The Evaluation highlighted several key challenges faced by the Initiative and lessons learned and revealed areas where the Foundation needs to strengthen its own systems and strategies (7Á9). First, despite gains in capacity in skills and practical knowledge, there is uneven documentation in both the peer-reviewed and non peerreviewed literature of the work of the Initiative. Second, Foundation information systems were unable to provide timely and complete information on grantee outputs. Third, efficiency and sustainability would be enhanced by coordination with other large funders and partners. For example, the simultaneous growth of networks such as WHO's Global Outreach Alert and Response Network, the Global Laboratories Directory and Network, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) were not planned to interoperate with the DSN grantees, limiting opportunities to efficiently work and grow together. Fourth, a formal exit strategy to guide the Foundation when concluding the work of the Initiative was not put into place early enough. Finally, monitoring and evaluation practices within grants were informal and not well documented.  Recommendations  The evaluation teams made detailed recommendations in three main categories for the Foundation's work in Asia, Africa, and globally (7Á9): (i) ensure sustainability of the substantial gains made by the Foundation's grantee partners; (ii) promote the One Health concept and practice; and (iii) capture the lessons and achievements of the Initiative and communicate these widely.In response to these recommendations, the Foundation convened all DSN grantees in April 2011 in Nairobi, Kenya, to consolidate the experience and learning of the Initiative, disseminate evaluation findings, and consider the needs of the field going forward. The Foundation also supported the legal institutionalization of MBDS to ensure continuity of the work in Asia and provided further time-bound support to SACIDS. In addition, in partnership with the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), Fondation Mérieux and the Skoll Global Threats Fund, the Foundation supported the legal institutionalization of CORDS to ensure its sustainability. Finally, the Foundation provided transition support for its One Health work, with the expectation that this will come to fruition and be highlighted at the Prince Mahidol Award Conference in Bangkok, 2013, where the theme is ''A World United Against Infectious Diseases: Cross-Sectoral Solutions.''  Conclusion  In conclusion, the evaluation of the Disease Surveillance Networks Initiative was an important undertaking within the Foundation. Lessons learned have been shared internally and are being applied to the current and future work of the Foundation. The results demonstrated the value and merit of the Foundation's investments in supporting disease surveillance networks and other grantee work in this portfolio, resulting in a successful application to the Board of Trustees of the Foundation for additional funding to support sustainability among key partners. Sustainability of the progress achieved and relationships nurtured through the DSN Initiative is important to the Foundation, especially as internal efforts are directed elsewhere. Building on the clear evidence of ongoing relevance, motivation, and sustained engagement in the networks by members and partners, and solid interest from other funders, the Foundation has supported institutional independence of MBDS and CORDS.  							1	
24787145	Validation of three geolocation strategies for health-facility attendees for research and public health surveillance in a rural setting in western Kenya	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4102101/	Understanding the spatial distribution of disease is critical for effective disease control. Where formal address networks do not exist, tracking spatial patterns of clinical disease is difficult. Geolocation strategies were tested at rural health facilities in western Kenya. Methods included geocoding residence by head of compound, participatory mapping and recording the self-reported nearest landmark. Geocoding was able to locate 72·9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 67·7–77·6] of individuals to within 250 m of the true compound location. The participatory mapping exercise was able to correctly locate 82·0% of compounds (95% CI 78·9–84·8) to a 2 × 2·5 km area with a 500 m buffer. The self-reported nearest landmark was able to locate 78·1% (95% CI 73·8–82·1) of compounds to the correct catchment area. These strategies tested provide options for quickly obtaining spatial information on individuals presenting at health facilities.	INTRODUCTION  Many infectious diseases show microepidemiological geographical variation. Outbreaks of (emerging) infectious diseases may be geographically confined or start in small pockets that later give rise to larger outbreaks [1] [2] [3] [4] . For endemic infectious diseases with stable disease transmission, considerable geographical heterogeneity in the intensity of transmission has been described [2, [5] [6] [7] [8] . Geographical variation for both epidemic and endemic infectious disease occurrence has important public health consequences. Identifying regions with higher disease burden can facilitate costeffective prioritization of control efforts [9] [10] [11] . Within regions, identifying areas of persistent and intense transmission may prevent outbreaks of disease that spread from these areas and support disease elimination strategies when overall disease occurrence has declined [2, 12, 13] . To allow spatial targeting of disease control efforts, attributing a geographical location to each disease occurrence is ideal, and the minimum number required for accurate monitoring is likely to be disease specific [9, 14, 15] .Given adequate address information, automated geocoding software packages can generate accurate spatial coordinate data for a large proportion of individuals [16, 17] , thereby providing a basis for the spatial analysis of disease transmission [18] [19] [20] . In circumstances where formal address data are unavailable or privacy concerns limit the use of precise spatial locations, other approaches have been used to obtain geographical information on incident cases. Catchment areas of, for example, community pharmacies or general practitioners have been used for describing spatial patterns in disease occurrence [6, 15, [20] [21] [22] . In areas with well-developed public health infrastructure, catchment areas tend to be well defined and sufficiently small to allow a meaningful attribution of localities to clinical cases based on the facility they attended [20, 22] . Geolocation approaches are likely to have less utility for resource-poor settings where formal address systems are commonly unavailable and where health-facility catchment areas are relatively large and poorly defined [5, 23, 24] . Alternative approaches to geolocation strategies are needed in such settings.Two of the most commonly used geolocation strategies for rural resource-poor environments are distributing compound ID cards after an enumeration exercise or actively visiting compounds and geolocating the area of residence for individuals of interest [25] . Although these methods provide accurate spatial information, they are not operationally attractive outside research settings [10, 21, 25] . Approaches that can be implemented without the need for house-to-house visits would facilitate the incorporation of spatial information into routine data collection and public health planning at the local level. If this can be done with sufficient precision it would support the identification of local-level disease heterogeneity [5, 18, 25] .Here, we examine the accuracy and precision of three approaches to geolocate health facility attendees in a rural area of western Kenya: geocoding on name of head of compound, participatory mapping using satellite imagery, and attributing participants to the catchment area of the self-reported nearest landmark.  Study site  The study was conducted in a rural area of Rachuonyo South district, Nyanza Province in the western Kenyan highlands that spans about 300 km 2 .There is one main road that runs through the area and the landscape consists of rolling hills and several large rivers (Fig. 1) . The population mostly comprises people from the Luo ethnic group whose main occupation is subsistence agriculture. Compounds typically comprise extended families living in proximity to their fields or in multi-unit structures in the few, more urban, market centres [26] .Five rural health facilities were identified whose catchments overlapped with community-based crosssectional surveys being performed (Fig. 1) [27] . Cross-sectional malaria surveys in the health facilities were conducted in October 2011 and in July 2012 to coincide with the bimodal seasonal peaks in malaria transmission. Four of the five health facilities were sampled during both surveys. One facility was replaced for the second year to maximize overlap with the ongoing community work. All patients and accompanying individuals attending the outpatient clinic were recruited for the survey. A questionnaire was administered to all consenting participants to obtain information on malaria indicators and their area of residence, as described below. Tracing individual compounds from health-facility attendees is a laborious and costly exercise because of the large catchment areas and inaccessible terrain and could therefore not be completed for all attendees. For operational reasons, following the facility survey, 30% of participants were randomly selected and traced to their compounds, to validate the geolocation strategies being tested. Compounds were mapped using a GPS receiver.  Method 1: Geocoding  A system of geocoding was developed to match 'postal addresses' to an existing spatial database. In this setting in rural Kenya, compounds are known by the name of the compound head, usually the patriarch of the family. Individuals have three names, two given and one family name. Names of the compound head were collected as part of the questionnaire at the facility. Names were matched to an existing database of names of compound heads with associated spatial coordinates collected as part of a large cross-sectional survey in the area. This community survey sampled about one third of the population [27] . As not all compounds were sampled during the community survey, the names of the three nearest neighbours were also collected at the facility to increase the probability of finding a match. This method would be useful in areas that have existing and updated registries with accompanying spatial information and could easily be applied to all scales, depending on the availability of baseline data.Analysis was restricted to those compounds located in the area of the community survey. Names from the two databases were matched using Levenshtein's distance algorithm [28] for string matching using Stata v. 12.1 (StataCorp, USA). Possible matches, where the matching probability was 580%, were checked manually. Matches were discarded if: (a) there was more than one compound head with the same name in either database; (b) if only one of the three names was recorded; or (c) if all three names were provided but at least one of the names did not match. This process was repeated for the names of the nearest neighbours. All likely matches were plotted in ArcGIS v. 10.1 (ESRI, USA) and the distance between the actual geolocated compound and the matched compound from the community survey was calculated.Compounds from the health-facility survey were considered successfully located if they were <250 m from the corresponding compound in the community survey. This resolution was a pragmatic choice as it was deemed an acceptable balance between accuracy and spatial resolution, as this area would only likely comprise 2 or 3 compounds.Of the geolocated participants, 519 lived within the area of the community cross-sectional malaria survey and could be used for geolocation. Of the 328 matched compounds, 56% were successfully located using the head of compound. Of the participants that were matched, 72·9% were correctly located to within 250 m (95% CI 67·7-77·6, median distance 36·2 m). Possible reasons for why more people were not correctly matched may include people not being familiar with the full names of their neighbours or reporting different heads of compound for the same   Method 2: Participatory mapping  The second method assessed was participatory mapping, and was similar to the recently published 'map-book' exercise [25] and involved producing poster-sized, high-resolution satellite images (Quickbird; Digital Globe, USA) of each facility catchment area (Fig. 2) . Locations of health facilities, schools, markets and other key landmarks were labelled on the image and a reference grid consisting of 2 × 2·5 km 'blocks' was superimposed on the area [27] . Each block comprised 20 'cells', each measuring 500 × 500 m. Each block/cell combination was given a unique numeric identifier. The system (including size of polygon) was selected because it was familiar to the field workers and would provide them a better frame of reference for facilitating the exercise. As part of the participant questionnaire, the interviewer would explain the main features of the satellite map and with the participant, would attempt to locate the residence on the map and record the corresponding cell identifier. Due to the spatial resolution required to locate compounds, this approach is most applicable to local scale but could be scaled up if satellite imagery was indexed into a book-format instead of a poster.Locations of participants followed to their compounds were plotted in ArcGIS and were classified as correctly located based on the participatory mapping exercise if they fell within the reported cell. To account for the likely edge effect with compounds located just outside a grid cell being considered incorrect, the proportion of compounds correctly identified within 500 m (one cell) or 1000 m (two cells) surrounding the reported block/cell was also calculated.The distance between the edge of the cell/buffer and the incorrectly located compounds was calculated in ArcGIS to determine the mean error associated with the approach.Using the participatory mapping approach, 64·9% (95% CI 61·2-68·4) of 695 participants who attempted the mapping exercise were successfully located to the appropriate 2 × 2·5 km block (Table 1) . When a 500 m buffer in all directions around the block was included, the proportion correctly located improved to 82% (95% CI 78·9-84·8) at the block level and from 12·4% (95% CI 10·0-15·0) to 57·1% (95% CI 53·3-60·8) at the cell level.However, 135 (16·3%) participants did not participate in the mapping exercise. Reasons for refusal were not recorded, but there were no differences in sex or age distributions in the populations who did and did not participate in the exercise. Of those willing to locate their residence, 61·5% were female compared to 58·9% in the unwilling group (P = 0·6). Similarly, the mean age in the adult populations in those unwilling to locate their residence was slightly higher at 37·9 years compared to 35·3 years in those that did attempt the exercise, although the difference was not significant (P = 0·3).For compounds that were incorrectly located, the median distance to the correct block was 489 m (IQR 229-1036 m), 1036 m (IQR 737-1737), and 1737 m (IQR 1179-2728) for the block only, >500 m buffer, and >1000 m buffer, respectively. The median distance of compounds incorrectly located from the identified cells was 539 m (IQR 236-1095 m), 1055 m (IQR 737-1644) including a 500 m buffer, and 1588 m (IQR 1200-2180 m) including a 1000 m buffer. Moreover, the proportion of people that were correctly identified to a specific block or cell significantly varied per facility (block only, P = 0·007; >500 m, P = 0·003; >1000 m, P < 0·0001).  Method 3: Nearest self-reported landmarks  The final method tested was to see if participants resided in the catchment of self-reported nearest landmarks. This approach is the most flexible and could be easily applied at all scales, given a database of the relevant landmark with accompanying spatial information is available. At the health facility, each participant was asked to name the nearest health facility, primary school, market and church to their compound. Combinations of responses were also assessed using overlapping catchment areas to increase the precision of the approach. Locations of compounds were plotted using ArcGIS and a compound was considered to be correctly located if it fell within the catchment area or intersecting catchment areas that matched the response provided at the facility.Catchment areas for each type of landmark were estimated based on both Euclidian distance (straightline) and cost distance [29, 30] . There were some missing coordinates for certain reported schools. Therefore, analysis was restricted to participants who reported residing near the schools with known coordinates. Euclidian distances were calculated using the ArcGIS Euclidian distance tool in the spatial analyst package to delineate catchment areas for both health facilities (Fig. 3a) and primary schools (Fig. 3b) .A cost-distance function to account for factors that may either impede or facilitate travel was also used to delineate landmark catchment areas. Given the gently undulating topography of the study area, it was assumed that ease and speed of travel between compounds and relevant landmarks is determined either by the presence of roads (facilitating travel) or by the presence of rivers (impeding travel). Roads and rivers in the study area were digitized using highresolution Quickbird satellite multispectral imagery at 2·8 m resolution sharpened with a 60 cm resolution panchromatic image. Roads were classified into four categories: (1) tarred roads where the likely maximum speed is 80 km/h; (2) roads that are not tarred but where vehicles travel at a likely maximum speed of 40 km/h; (3) roads that are not tarred but accessible to a vehicle or motorbike with likely maximum speeds of 20 km/h; (4) paths not likely traversed by a vehicle but by motorbike with likely maximum speeds of 10 km/h. For all other surfaces, including walking paths or fields, a maximum speed of 5 km/h was assumed [23] . Rivers were classified as barriers to movement except where they were intersected by a road or path. The cost-distance models for both health facilities (Fig. 3c ) and primary schools (Fig. 3d) were created using IDRISI software (Clark Laboratories, USA) and imported into ArcGIS for analysis.The mean error for both methods was calculated as the distance between the border of the catchment and the location of the incorrectly located compound. The distance between each compound and the centroid of each polygon could have been calculated. However, due to the irregular shape of many of the polygons, the distance to the centroid is not be an accurate reflection of the error rate in this approach as points that are far away from the centroid but located to the correct catchment area would generate a large error rate and be misleading.Analysis of self-reported nearest landmarks indicated that responses for nearest market tended to predominantly consider relatively large markets, rather than smaller, local markets. In addition there was too much variability in responses concerning the nearest church, the majority of which were small establishments whose spatial coordinates had not been recorded, to conduct meaningful analysis. For these reasons only data relating to the nearest health facility and primary school were retained.Overall, the nearest health facility and primary school were reported correctly 84·9% (95% CI 82·2-87·2) and 73·4% (95% CI 68·8-77·7) of the time, respectively, based on straight-line distance (median distance 1486 m, IQR 1008-2241 m). The use of the self-reported nearest primary school was able to locate 82·0% (95% CI 78·1-85·8) of participants' compounds to the correct Euclidian distance catchment area (mean area of 6·7 km 2 ) ( Table 2) with a median distance to the self-reported nearest school of 878 m (IQR 522-1234 m). The self-reported nearest health facility was able to locate 78·1% (95% CI 73·8-82·1) of compounds to an area of 12·3 km 2 . When the combination of responses was tested, the mean area reduced to 1·7 km 2 and 48·7% (95% CI 43·6-53·6) of participants' compounds were correctly located.Next, 77·1% (95% CI 74·1-80·0) and 78·1% (95% CI 73·8-82·1) of participants were located to the correct health facility and school catchments, respectively, using the cost-distance catchment area. The combined responses were able to locate individuals based on the combination of responses with 72·4% (95% CI 67·8-76·8) of compounds successfully located to a mean area of 3·7 km 2 (table 2). Of those individuals who did not reside in the catchment area of the reported nearest landmark, the mean distance away from the edge of the catchment area was 1252 m (IQR 261-1899 m) for catchments based on Euclidian distance and 496 m (IQR 174-605 m) using the cost-distance model.  Ethical considerations  This study was approved by the ethics committees of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM 5956) and the Kenya Medical Research Institute (SSC 1589). Individual informed consent was sought from all participants of the health-facility survey by signature or thumbprint accompanied with the signature of an independent witness. As defined in the Kenya national guidelines, participants aged <18 years who were pregnant, married, or a parent were considered 'mature minors' and consented for themselves [31] .  Data analysis  The proportion of study participants whose compounds were correctly located using each geolocation strategy of all participants that provided responses for each method and corresponding binomial 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. Mean error of each method was determined by calculating the distance between the actual location of the compound and edge of the identified area. Plotting the proportions for each approach against the mean area identified the optimum strategy: strategies located in the top left corner of the plot signified high precision and accuracy.  RESULTS  Across both surveys, 3034 people were enrolled of which 830 (27%) were able to be traced back to their compounds and included in the analysis. Those that could not be traced were mainly due to running out of time and inaccurate information provided at the facility. The participants that could not be traced were evenly distributed between years and facilities.  Optimal geolocation approach  Although not directly comparable due to the different scales, the results across all strategies showed a logarithmic relationship between mean catchment area and proportion of compounds correctly identified (Fig. 4) . Points that are located in the top left corner represent the optimal combination of low mean area (high precision) and a high proportion of people correctly located using that strategy (high accuracy). The results of this analysis suggest that using the location of the nearest primary school as well as the participatory mapping with buffer was the most promising method to geolocate rural health-facility attendees in this rural study setting.  DISCUSSION  A simple and operationally feasible way to identify the spatial occurrence of disease in rural areas where homes have no formalized address would be an extremely useful tool and could easily be employed as an operationally attractive approach to spatial disease surveillance in a wide range of settings around the world. A recent study has been conducted in Blantyre, Malawi in an urban setting [25] ; however, our study is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to examine different methods to geolocate health-facility attendees in a rural area and to gauge their precision. Although strategies are not directly comparable due to the different spatial scales, the current study showed that there are options available to obtain spatial information in areas where no formal postal network exists. Results have shown that it was possible to correctly locate close to 80% of participant compounds using either a participatory mapping exercise (to 2 × 2·5 km blocks with buffer) or by using information about the nearest primary school. This is similar to the level of detection of most geocoding strategies when applied in developed countries, although the spatial resolution is not as good [17, 32] . In this study, methods based on name-matching or participatory mapping to the 500 × 500 m cell level proved to be less accurate, but are capable of greater spatial precision.The ideal geolocation approach in a rural setting will ultimately depend on the information available, the objectives, whether it be monitoring for epidemics or planning for disease control interventions, and the required spatial precision/accuracy. The geocoding approach requires that an accurate and up-to-date list of names of compound heads is available, which is unlikely to be the case outside areas of active community-based research. The geocoding approach also relies on names recorded being complete and recorded consistently; a difficult task in busy facilities. There may also be challenges in obtaining correct information from people who may want to remain anonymous. Moreover, a systematic bias is inevitable as compounds whose head has a common name or is the head of multiple compounds will never be matched unless other variables are also considered. However, in areas where a complete database is available, through land registries for example, or if overall accuracy is less important, geocoding could provide a useful geolocation approach.The participatory mapping exercise also has notable limitations. It requires that a map of the study area be available and that there are personnel familiar with the area capable of interpreting satellite imagery. Key features must be identifiable on the map to help orient readers. Although the age difference here was not significant, younger generations may also be more map literate than older generations. High-resolution satellite imagery can be expensive to acquire, up to several thousand US dollars [25] ; however, free imagery with good resolution is becoming more widely available for even remote areas in rural and low-income settings and a similar exercise could be conducted using web-based platforms as is increasingly being utilized for disaster response [33] [34] [35] . Further, depending on the size of the area of interest, it may be possible to create a schematic map of the area using local knowledge [10] .To facilitate participatory mapping, a grid was superimposed onto the study area, leading to an edge effect whereby if a person was located just outside of the block/cell they would be classified incorrectly even though the error margin could be only a few metres. Edge effect will always be an important limitation that must be accounted for in any application of this methodology particularly when the focus is on locating residences at a precise spatial resolution. However, despite this limitation, this research has provided important insight into how the edge effect can be minimized and sensitivity increased by the addition of buffer zones. Other approaches could have been used including a hexagonal grid or larger clusters as was used in the study in Blantyre's urban slum area [25] . These approaches will likely reduce, but not completely eliminate the edge effect. Moreover, in this study, there was a significant difference in the proportion of people correctly located at each health facility and not every participant was willing to complete the exercise. This suggests that the familiarity of the interviewers with the area, their ability to read and explain the maps to local populations, and the time they have or choose to dedicate may be important determinants for success.The use of the nearest landmark approach requires that the location of the feature in question (e.g. church, school) be known. This could be done by visiting and mapping each site using a GPS receiver, or sites could be located on a map by someone familiar with the area. National databases of the locations of such landmarks are becoming more common and therefore this limitation may be less relevant; however, to be useful, databases must be up to date and include all government, faith-based, and private facilities. In this study, people only correctly located the nearest landmark around 80% of the time and the accuracy of this approach was dependent on the definition of catchment area used. The reporting bias may be due to factors such as spatial perceptions of 'closeness', the density of that type of landmark in the area, or reporting known or highly frequented landmarks rather than those that are closer. Other possible landmarks that could be used include nearest chief or assistant chief, nearest shop, or nearest local transport point. In terms of defining catchment areas, both methods produced similar results [36] . The analysis using the cost-distance catchment areas showed a lower error rate based on the distance from the edge of the catchment area suggesting that this approach may be more robust. However, the utility of this approach is limited to areas with digitized travel networks, access to the required software, and the expertise to create the cost-distance surface is required.The goals of the geolocation exercise will influence the optimum strategy. First, the ideal scale will depend on the spatial pattern of the disease and the size of the area of interest [5] . For example, if the objective was to identify foci of infections of a highly heterogeneous disease such as malaria in a low endemic or epidemic setting [7, 9, 20] then achieving higher precision would be essential. Conversely, if the distribution of sexually transmitted infections was being studied, less precision may be acceptable or even necessary to guarantee anonymity [20] . Second, the ideal strategy will depend on the purpose of geolocating cases. If it is for programmatic use such as passive public health surveillance, or to establish disease distribution at a regional or national level, then using the nearest health facility, with a larger mean catchment area may be sufficient. However, if greater precision and accuracy were required, for identification of foci for disease elimination or identifying where to implement control, for example, then knowing the exact boundaries of the catchment area or having a comprehensive postal network that can be geocoded to a high precision would be essential.There were some limitations to this study. First, it was only feasible to trace 27% of participants to their compounds. Although this provided a large sample, it is possible that if we could have traced all individuals, the results and the conclusions on the applicability of the techniques tested may have been different. However, as the sample was a random selection, the impact on the results is expected to be minimal. Similarly, spatial coordinates were only available for the government-run primary schools in the area, thereby restricting the sample to those residing near these schools. The limited number of school locations that were available as well as the lack of covariates such as size or perception of academic rigour to include as part of delineation of catchment areas likely influenced the size of catchment areas as calculated by both approaches. However, although altered catchment area boundaries would impact both the precision and accuracy of the results, this is not likely to have a significant impact of the results.Spatial monitoring of health-facility data has strengthened public health programmes in developed countries and facilitates conducting research with passively collected data [6, 37] . However, the ability to efficiently geolocate individuals residing in areas where no formal address network exists or where the settlement pattern is not conducive to matching individuals to specific localities is currently lacking, particularly in areas around the world where infectious disease transmission persists [5, 38] . The geolocation strategies tested as part of this research exemplify alternative options for obtaining spatial information from health-facility patients in a setting that is typical for much of rural sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the world. Easily collected spatial information can supplement both passive and active disease surveillance to detect foci of transmission, enables the detection of outbreaks in a timely manner, and facilitates tracking of how disease spreads through the population over time [37, 39, 40] . If validated in other parts of the world, these results indicate that recording the nearest primary school or implementation of a participatory mapping exercise at rural health facilities offer potential strategies to facilitate spatial analysis of disease dynamics. Further research is needed to demonstrate their utility in a range of settings and their operational viability before formal testing in a broader operational context.  		1					1	
25671116	Public, environmental, and occupational health research activity in Arab countries: bibliometric, citation, and collaboration analysis	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4322552/	BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to analyze quantity, assess quality, and investigate international collaboration in research from Arab countries in the field of public, environmental and occupational health. METHODS: Original scientific articles and reviews published from the 22 Arab countries in the category "public, environmental & occupational health" during the study period (1900 – 2012) were screened using the ISI Web of Science database. RESULTS: The total number of original and review research articles published in the category of "public, environmental & occupational health" from Arab countries was 4673. Main area of research was tropical medicine (1862; 39.85%). Egypt with 1200 documents (25.86%) ranked first in quantity and ranked first in quality of publications (h-index = 51). The study identified 2036 (43.57%) documents with international collaboration. Arab countries actively collaborated with authors in Western Europe (22.91%) and North America (21.04%). Most of the documents (79.9%) were published in public health related journals while 21% of the documents were published in journals pertaining to prevention medicine, environmental, occupational health and epidemiology. CONCLUSION: Research in public, environmental and occupational health in Arab countries is in the rise. Public health research was dominant while environmental and occupation health research was relatively low. International collaboration was a good tool for increasing research quantity and quality.	Background  Public, environmental and occupational health is an important medical discipline. Studies and research in this field can shed light on the current health situation, future health challenges, epidemiology of diseases, health policies, and standards of healthcare in any particular country. Therefore, assessment of the research activity in this field is important for several reasons. First, it enables healthy policy makers to aware of the national health status, health indicators, and health challenges facing the country [1, 2] . Second, it reflects the contribution of the country to global scientific literature [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Third, it reflects the extent of the country's collaboration with international investigators in the field of health research which is an important tool in improving national research activity and quality [10, 11] . Some authors described the field of public health as multidisciplinary, high-benefit, but undervalued and that researchers and practitioners need to influence the development of public health research within individual countries to promote public health research area [12] .Many health issues in Arab countries are considered serious and research and collaboration in these health issues is a key factor in facing and solving these health issues. For example, North Africa, Middle East, and Gulf area will have the second highest increase in percentage of people with diabetes mellitus in 2030 compared to other parts of the world [13] . According to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), 6 out of the world's top ten countries for highest prevalence (%) of diabetes are in the Middle East and North Africa Region -Kuwait, Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates [14] . A recently published review article indicated that the overall estimated prevalence of hypertension among Arabs was 29.5% which is higher than that reported from the USA and sub-Saharan African [15] . Another recent study indicated that prevalence of hypertension among Arab American is 36.5% which is higher than the overall worldwide estimates of hypertension prevalence [16] . Furthermore, reports from some Arab countries indicated that hypertension is being under-treated and mostly uncontrolled [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Several studies reported that the prevalence rate of obesity in Arabic region is high [24] [25] [26] . Arab countries have been the source of some fatal infectious diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome which was initially diagnosed in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). There was an outbreak of polio in Syria that made international agencies to call for ceasefire to accomplish polio vaccination campaign [27] . Another example is the cholera outbreak in Baghdad after the second gulf war [28] . According to World Health Organization (WHO), conservative communities like Arab countries have the fastest rate of increase in the number of HIV infections and the lowest coverage with antiretroviral therapy [29] . Highly pathogenic and serious viral infections like avian flu virus, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are still an important risk of morbidity and mortality and pose a real threat for some Arab countries like Egypt [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Similarly, serious parasitic infections like malaria, schistosomiasis and trypanosomiasis constitute major health, social and economic challenge for Egypt, Sudan, Yemen and other Arab countries [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Zoontic infections, like brucellosis and hydatid disease, are also present in several Arab countries and pose a continuous health challenge [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . In addition to all of this, there is evidence that serious and common infectious agents in Arab region, like Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus and some gram-negative bacilli are developing multiple drug resistance which is a true future public health challenge at regional and global level [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] .Several studies about public health situation, challenges and future aspects of health systems in Arab countries have been published [55] [56] [57] . Similarly, several studies in environmental and occupational health risks in Arab countries have also been published [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] . However, up to the authors' best knowledge, no reports about the quantity and quality of public, environmental and occupational health from Arab countries had been published [64] [65] [66] [67] . Bibliometric studies are important because they can be used to obtain data and draw a picture about the state of research in any particular field in any particular country. Several international bibliometric studies in the field of public, environmental and occupational health have been published but none was published from Arab countries [67] [68] [69] . Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze the quantity and quality of research published in "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health" category in Arab countries. These disciplines are joined in one category in Web of Science (WoS) database which we used in data extraction methodology. This category encompasses all journals in the fields of public health, occupational health, environmental health, prevention medicine, and epidemiology. Few years ago, this category was called "Preventive and Occupational Medicine, Epidemiology and Public Health". Several bibliometric analysis were published about various medical fields from Arab countries but none was published about public, environmental and occupational health [3, 70, 71] . Our study comes in line with several recent articles published in Lancet journal that described the health situation in Arab countries and strongly encouraged researchers to publish in this field [29, 72] . Therefore, such study will shed light on the current and future "Public, Environmental, and Occupational Health" status in Arab countries. Furthermore, the results of the study will help public health advocates, environmentalists, toxicologists and people in politics as well to decide on future research in this field and how to allocate funds for researchers in this field. In addition, the momentum for research activity needs to be maintained through continuous analysis of publications from researchers in the region to provide feedback to academic, health institutions and education planners. Finally, in Arab countries, health priorities are changing [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] which necessitates periodic assessments of health challenges and progress in health research especially when political and humanitarian challenges are dominating the scene in many Arab countries [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] .  Methods  The data used in this study were based on the ISI Web of Science, which is one of the world largest databases of peer-reviewed literature. The WoS databases provide authoritative, multidisciplinary coverage from more than 12,000 high impact research journals worldwide [84] . Web of Science was developed by Thomson Scientific and is well known for its annual report about journal impact factor which is an important measure of the quality and influential power of publications. Web of Science is easy to use and has a simple and advanced search tools. With the advanced search tool, a list of codes can be used to achieve the required objective of the search. One of the codes in WoS advanced search is "WC" which refers to Web of Science Category. There are more than 100 categories for selection and one of which is "public, environmental, and occupational health". Few years ago, this category was called "Preventive and Occupational Medicine, Epidemiology and Public Health" because it encompasses journals in all fields listed in the category. In addition to the above character of the advanced search tool in WoS, detailed citation analysis of the results of the advanced search can also be easily obtained. A comprehensive analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of various databases including Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus is presented by Falagas et al. [85] . In contrast to PubMed, Web of Science covers most scientific publication and not only the medical and biomedical publication as in the case of PubMed. Furthermore, Web of Science covers the oldest publications and its records go back to 1900. A major disadvantage of PubMed is the fact that it does not provide citation analysis and therefore does not allow for qualitative analysis of published literature [85] . In the current study, the objective of the study was to assess the quantity and quality of public, environmental and occupational health related research from Arab countries. One of our objectives is qualitative analysis which cannot be carried out by PubMed. Furthermore, although public/environmental/ occupational health is a medical subject, research in this field could have been carried out and published in nonmedical journals which make PubMed less suitable for this purpose than WoS. Finally, WoS has journal categories that would facilitate the accomplishment of the objective of this study. Such journal categories are not available through PubMed but available through Scimago, which is a portal that includes the journals contained in the Sco-pus® database (Elsevier B.V.).In . Palestine was excluded from search keys because the Web of Science database does not recognize Palestine as an independent state yet. However, we used city keys as a search strategy to extract data pertaining to research output from Palestine and then the results of the 2 search strategies were combined and analyzed. The search keys for Palestine looked like this: (WC = (Public, Environmental & Occupational Health) AND CI = ((Nablus) OR (Jenin) OR (Ramallah) OR (Bethlehem) OR (Tulkarem) OR (Abu dis) OR (Gaza)) AND CU = (Israel)). Furthermore, to increase the accuracy of results, research was refined and limited to original research articles and review articles because they represent the original research activities, while other types of documents like editorials, conference proceedings, and others were excluded. The time frame for the result was set as 1900 -2012. Of course, this does not mean that there will be publications from Arab countries as early as 1900. However we set this date to retrieve as many publications as possible. The 2013 and 2014 years were excluded because they are still open for new journal issues. Finally, the authors would like to state that using this methodology will not retrieve 100% of the literature published in the field of public, environmental and occupational health in Arab countries simply because there are some international and regional health journals that are not indexed in ISI web of science. For example, Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal is one of the regional journals in the field of public health in which many Arab researchers did publish; however, documents published in this journal were not counted because it is not indexed in ISI Web of Science.The Web of Science database generates a count of the total number of original articles, total citations, and the value of the h-index (highly cited index). The h-index represents the number of citations received for each of the documents in descending order, for example: h-index of 10 means that there are 10 items that have 10 citations or more [86, 87] . Publication activity was adjusted for Arab countries, categorized by population size and gross domestic product (GDP), which was retrieved from the online databases of the World Bank [88] . An adjustment index (AI) was calculated using the following formula: AI = [total number of publications for the country/GDP per capita of the country]*1000, where the GDP per capita = GDP/population of the country [9, 89, 90] . Scientific output was evaluated based on a methodology developed and used in other bibliometric studies [91] [92] [93] . The collected data were used to generate the following information: (a) total and trends of contributions to research during all previous years up to the set date of data analysis (December 31th, 2012); (b) Arab countries research productivity and collaboration patterns; (c) journals in which Arab world researchers published; and (d) the citations received by the publications.  Ethical approval  The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at An-Najah National University does not require submission of an IRB application for such study. The IRB considered that there is no risk for human subjects in such publications since the data are based on published literature and did not involve any interactions with human subjects.  Statistical analysis  Data from ISI Web of Science were exported to Microsoft Office Excel® and then transferred to the Microsoft word program. The measurements of bibliometric analysis (e.g. countries, cited articles, institutions) were converted to the rank order using the standard competition ranking (SCR). We took into consideration the top 10 ranking in each item. If the measurements of bibliometric analysis have the same ranking number, then a gap is left in the following ranking numbers. The journal's impact factors (IF) were evaluated using the Journal Citation Report (JCR; Web of Knowledge) 2012 science edition by Thomson Reuters (New York, NY, USA).  Results  The total number of documents retrieved was 4673. The language used in most of the published documents was English (4433; 94.86%). The annual number of published documents indicated that research activity remained low but steadily increasing. A sharp upward increase in research activity was seen after 2002 ( Figure 1 ). Areas of research interest of the 4673 published documents were mainly tropical medicine (1862; 39.85%) followed by environmental sciences/ecology (592; 12.67%) and infectious diseases (330; 7.06%). Table 1 shows top 10 research areas of published documents from Arab countries in the field of public, environmental and occupational health. Analysis of data based on each country's productivity showed that Egypt (1200; 25.86%) had the highest quantity of published documents followed by KSA (738; 15.79%) and Sudan (602; 12.88%). More than half (54%) of public, environmental and occupational health research from Arab countries came from Egypt, KSA, and Sudan (Table 2 ). Further analysis of research activity using number of population and national income to standardize results showed that Somalia, Egypt, and Sudan had the highest productivity as measured by adjustment index ( Table 2 ). The total number of citations of documents from Arab countries, at the time of data analysis (June 8th, 2014), was 51779 with an average citation of 11.08 per document. Of the 4673 documents considered for the h-index, 67 had been cited at least 67 times at the time of data analysis. Analysis showed that documents published from Egypt had the highest h index (51) followed by those published from Sudan (43) and KSA (32) .Collaboration between Arab countries and non-Arab countries in public, environmental and occupational health research was evident. All published documents (100.00%) from Somalia were made possible through collaboration with international authors. Iraq and Algeria had the lowest collaboration with 32.00% of Algerian published documents and 29.77% of Iraqi published documents were made through collaboration with non-Arab investigators. The study identified 2036 (43.57%) documents with 141 countries in Arab-non-Arab country collaboration analysis. Arab countries actively collaborated with authors from the United States of America (n = 910, the highest number recorded), followed by the England (n = 371), and France (n = 228) ( Table 3) . By region, Arab countries collaborated most with countries in Western Europe (22.91%) followed by North America (21.04%). Table 4 lists top 10 journals in which public, environmental and occupational health research documents were authored or co-authored by investigators from Arab countries. More than half of the top 10 journals were in the field of tropical medicine. One journal of the top 10 is in French language while the others were in English language. Analysis showed that a total of 481 (10.29%) documents were published in epidemiology journals, 103 (2.2%) were published in preventive medicine journals, 467 (9.99%) documents were published in environmental journals, and 105 (2.24%) were published in occupational health journals. The remaining documents (3736; 79.94%) were published in journals pertaining to public health.Finally, analysis of most research productive institutions in Arab countries showed that University of Khartoum with 343 documents (7.43%) ranked first followed by American university of Beirut and King Saud University with 292 (6.25%) and 270 (5.78%) documents respectively. The world health organization is an active partner in research in Arab countries in the field of public, environmental and occupational health. A total of 141 documents were co-authored by investigators from WHO. Furthermore, investigators from ministries of health from various Arab countries were present in 248 documents suggesting active participation of governmental bodies in public health research. Table 5 showed the top 10 productive institutions in public, environmental and occupational health in Arab countries.  Discussion  In this study, we analyzed a total of 4673 documents published from Arab countries in the field of public, environmental and occupational health. These documents were extracted from ISI web of science database. Despite certain points of weaknesses of ISI WoS in this regard, our study does give a clear picture and a close approximation of the quantity, quality, citation analysis, and international collaboration in research activity of documents in the field of public, environmental and occupational health in Arab countries. Furthermore, this study does establish a baseline data for future analysis and comparison in the field of public, environmental and occupational health. This becomes important given the political instability and reform going on in many Arab countries.Our study showed that all Arab countries, including countries like Somalia, have made variable contribution to public, environmental and occupational health research. The contribution of Arab countries to the field has been noticeable and evident all through the past years with particular growth after 2000. Interest of all Arab countries in this field indicates that governments and researchers are aware of the importance of public, environmental, and occupational health problems in Arab countries and are willing to address such problems. However, some Arab countries like Egypt and KSA have made the greatest research efforts. It was not surprising that Egypt and KSA were in the top of the list in quantity of research publications in the field of public, environmental, and occupational health. Similar findings were obtained when other medical fields were investigated and analyzed using bibliometric analysis [3, 89] . Based on our findings, countries with high national income or large population size, as was observed for Egypt and KSA; have the highest quantity of research output. It was surprising to us that Sudan came on the third position regarding the quantity of research publications. Actually Sudan came second when publication quality was measured by hindex. Furthermore, when data were re-calculated using adjustment index, Sudan was still among the top productive countries in the field of public, environmental and occupation health in Arab countries. Our data also indicated that University of Khartoum was top productive institute in the Arab world regarding research activity in this field. Several reasons could be cited for this. First, Sudan and Egypt showed high percentage of documents with international authors. Another potential reason for Sudan and Egypt to be among top leading countries in research in this field is the high prevalence of tropical parasitological diseases in these two countries [94, 95] . A final word here is the score of Somalia in AI which was the highest among all Arab countries. This is easily explained by the finding that all publications from Somalia were with international collaboration particularly physicians visiting Somalia with non-governmental organization or through the world health organization team based in Somalia and African countries.Researchers in Arab countries mainly collaborated with researchers from the United States of America, England and France. This may be due to the fact that most Arab academics and researchers were educated and trained in Europe and USA and few have academic or research ties with Asia, Africa, Latin America and other world regions. International collaboration is considered an advantage to Arab investigators. Actually, some Arab investigators had built research bridges with leading public health journals like Lancet and have succeeded in publishing series of articles regarding health situation in certain Arab countries [96] [97] [98] [99] . A study showed that investigators with international collaborations produce higher quality articles compared with those who do not [43] . Furthermore, a study showed that highly cited articles are usually authored by a large number of scientists and often involving international collaboration [100] . Highly cited articles positively contribute to the h-index of the individual author and to the institution and country [101] [102] [103] [104] . A study indicated that opportunities provided by The Lancet seem likely to encourage research and publication by individuals Arab investigators who have not traditionally had many chances to compete internationally [105] .In our study, we used citation analysis to measure the quality of publications from Arab countries. Citation is one of the key indicators of research quality and researchers need to be aware of mechanisms that might enhance citations of published articles. Therefore, Arab researchers in the field of public, environmental and occupational health should be encouraged to build bridges with other local, regional and international researchers in order to increase citations and therefore quality of their publications. This will improve research capacity and will reflect positively on the current and future health research in Arab world. The h-index was developed to overcome the main disadvantages of other bibliometric indicators, such as total number of papers or total number of citations. The h-index simultaneously measures the quality and quantity of scientific output. The h-index is one of the most commonly used indicators of research quality. However, h-index has certain disadvantages. For example, different databases can give different values of h-index and therefore each database has pros and cons when measuring the h-index [106] [107] [108] . Criticisms have also been addressed to the use of h-index as a marker of publication quality and citation. For example, the h-index does not consider the context of citations, the number of authors in the document, and gives equal values for book citation and research citation. Therefore, the h-index has lesser predictive accuracy and precision than mean citations per paper, although this is controversial [109, 110] . In our study, the h-index and mean citation per document were relatively high suggesting that publications from Arab countries have international audience and read and cited by other researchers. The h-index is commonly used to measure the performance of investigators and scientists and is based on the scientist's most cited articles and the number of citations that they have received in other publications. However, the h-index can also be applied to measure the performance of a group of scientists, such as a department or university or country, or a peer reviewed journal [111] [112] [113] .Research areas of published documents in the field of public, environmental and occupational health from Arab countries was mainly in tropical medicine. Actually tropical medicine, infectious diseases and parasitological research areas constituted more than 50% of the published documents from Arab countries. Furthermore, the results of our study showed that journals in the field of tropical medicine have a good share from public, environmental and occupational health publications from Arab countries. Interest in research regarding tropical diseases in Arab countries is expected given the high prevalence of such diseases and their heavy health impact on several Arab countries [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] .It is noteworthy that some Arab authors have succeeded in publishing in high-quality journals like Bulletin of the World Health Organization. International collaborations might have helped Arab researchers to publish in journals with a high IF. Definitely, most Arab investigators are keen to publish in high impact journals. However, due to lack of funding, lack of training, lack of national research policy in most Arab countries hinder many Arab investigators to publish in high impact journals. The advantage of publishing in leading and high impact journals is attraction of large audience from international bodies and consequent funding and collaboration. Actually, some leading health journals took the initiative and encouraged many Arab researchers to publish through sponsoring annual regional conferences and subsequent publication of submitted abstracts into special issues [119] .As was expected, the documents in public health field has the greatest share of publications while those pertaining to occupational, environmental, prevention medicine and epidemiology constituted approximately 20% of the total publications. A study in developing countries indicated that occupational health research is neglected in these countries and researchers in developing countries in the field of occupational health should focus less on the workplace and more on the worker in his or her social context [120] . Actually, occupational injuries in some Arab countries have been reported to be high [62] . One potential reason for this neglect of occupational health research in Arab countries is the lack of experts or lack of awareness about the importance of this discipline [121] .Finally, it is important to mention here that several bibliometric studies about public health in general were published from non-Arab countries. One study showed that USA is leading the world in the fields of Preventive Medicine, Occupational/Environmental Medicine and Epidemiology, and the contribution of USA researchers to the field of Public Health is outstanding. On the other hand, less developed world regions are still lagging behind in the field and governments should support researchers in order to improve scientific production and advancement of knowledge in their countries [67] . A second study from India indicated that public health research output is increasing in India but the distribution of research topics and the quality of research reports continue to be unsatisfactory and that health policy makers need to address deficits in public health research in order to reduce the very large disease burden in India [69] . A third study in Africa showed regional variation in research output in the field of public health. The authors of the study indicated that this might assist policymakers to facilitate the advancement of public health research in different regions of Africa, and could be useful for international organizations in identifying needs and to allocate research funding [66] .  Limitation  This study is not without limitations. First of all, we used ISI WoS category criteria for data extraction. Articles published in journals not categorized in the public, environmental and occupational health category were not included. Furthermore, journals that were not indexed in ISI WoS were not counted in the analysis. For example, research reports published in Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal were not counted because this journal is not indexed in ISI WoS. Furthermore, the methodology developed in this article did not distinguish between public, environmental and occupational health.In addition, some international journals do not recognize countries like Palestine as an independent state and publications from Palestine may be affiliated with Israel as a country. Therefore, some publications from Palestine might be missed from our analysis.  Conclusion  This study, to the best of the authors' knowledge, is the first detailed analysis of research output in the field of public, environmental and occupational health from Arab countries. This paper's main goals was to direct attention and open the doors for a scientific discussion among professionals and academics to direct research in this field to bridge the gap and increase visibility of health problems in Arab countries. Health policy makers in Arab countries should identify gaps in public health research and allocate funds to carry out studies to fill these gaps. It is hoped that such a study will serve those who draw future plans regarding public health to direct research into research areas mostly needed based on the changing political and social atmosphere in the Arab world. Both communicable and non-communicable disease problems need to be made visible to the international health organizations as well as governmental health bodies in Arab countries in order to set priorities for funding and financial allocations. Furthermore, this study should enable academics and investigators to search for most potential international investigators who share the same public health interest in order to cooperate successfully in research and publications. International publications should be directed toward making serious and common health problems in Arab countries more visible to internal and external audience in order to take an action by those in the authority. Definitely, topics like environmental health and preventive medicine need to be over emphasized, not only at the research level but also at the academic and governmental levels. The present data show a good start and promising rise for research activity in public health in Arab countries. However, research output in environmental and occupational health is still low. Studies in the field of preventive medicine as well as epidemiological studies in Arab countries are particularly needed. Investing in more international and national collaborative research projects should be highly encouraged. One potential method to broaden such international cooperation is through academic scholarships, exchange visits of graduate students as well as investigators. Establishing national specialized institutions for public, environmental and occupational health at the level of the entire Arab world is helpful and will make cooperation, even among Arab countries themselves, stronger and better. Such a public health institution could cooperate with the World Health Organization in increasing awareness regarding recent public health problem in the Arab world and could establish research connections with international researchers and could issue a specialized journal that will be the voice of public health specialists in Arab countries.  	1							
26078201	Antiviral activity of silymarin against chikungunya virus	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4468427/	The mosquito-borne chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes chikungunya fever, with clinical presentations such as severe back and small joint pain, and debilitating arthritis associated with crippling pains that persist for weeks and even years. Although there are several studies to evaluate the efficacy of drugs against CHIKV, the treatment for chikungunya fever is mainly symptom-based and no effective licensed vaccine or antiviral are available. Here, we investigated the antiviral activity of three types of flavonoids against CHIKV in vitro replication. Three compounds: silymarin, quercetin and kaempferol were evaluated for their in vitro antiviral activities against CHIKV using a CHIKV replicon cell line and clinical isolate of CHIKV of Central/East African genotype. A cytopathic effect inhibition assay was used to determine their activities on CHIKV viral replication and quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to calculate virus yield. Antiviral activity of effective compound was further investigated by evaluation of CHIKV protein expression using western blotting for CHIKV nsP1, nsP3, and E2E1 proteins. Briefly, silymarin exhibited significant antiviral activity against CHIKV, reducing both CHIKV replication efficiency and down-regulating production of viral proteins involved in replication. This study may have important consequence for broaden the chance of getting the effective antiviral for CHIKV infection.	  Phylogenetic analysis shows that CHIKV has three genotype variants; West African, East/Central/ South African (ECSA) and Asian 8 . Malaysia had its first outbreak in late 1998 at the suburb Klang in the state of Selangor and the CHIKV was identified as Asian genotype. Localized outbreaks and clustered cases were reported in Larut Matang, Lama, Perak. The ECSA genotype virus caused outbreaks after 2006. In early 2008, together with the neighboring Singapore, the epidemic in Johor began. This spread throughout states in Peninsular Malaysia and in 2009, many cases occurred in Selangor, Melaka, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang states and peaked in Kelantan, Kedah, Terengganu, Perlis and Sarawak 4, 9, 10 . From April 2008 until March 2010, over 10,000 cases were reported in these nationwide outbreaks, although there were no fatalities 11 .The main mosquito vectors for CHIKV are A. aegypti and A. albopictus 3, 4, 7 . A. aegypti was a primary vector for the outbreak that happened in Kenya, Comoros, Africa and Asia, but the ' Asian Tiger Mosquitoe' A. albopictus was the main vector for the Reunion and subsequent Indian Ocean outbreak 12 . Vector switching to A. albopictus became predominant due to the substitution of Alanine residue 226 to Valine residue in the CHIKV E1 protein (A226V) 13 . This convergent mutation seems to be due to the selective pressure as the impact of different and new environment or ecosystem.Extensive studies continue around the world to find an effective cure, safe antiviral treatment or vaccine for CHIKV infection. In one study it was shown that chloroquine phosphate, an antimalarial drug, can decrease the intensity or duration of pain, and number of joints involved. However, the effectiveness of chloroquine to treat chronic symptoms could not be evaluated due to the lack of adequate control patients with these symptoms 14 . The synergistic effect of ribavirin with interferon alpha 2B against CHIKV infection was reported only in an in vitro study 6 . It has been shown that arbidol strongly interferes with the early stages of CHIKV infection by targeting the cellular membrane. However, it is only a potent inhibitor against in vitro CHIKV infection 15 .Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds that are present in different plants, foods and drinks. Flavonoids are well known for their different biological properties including: antimicrobial activity, anti-inflammatory activity, anti-allergic activity, and cytotoxic antitumor activity 16 . Quercetin has antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV) type-1, respiratory syncytial virus, pseudorabies virus, parainfluenza virus type 3 and Sindbis virus, a type member of genus Alphavirus. The mechanism of actions of quercetin includes: enhancing the antiviral activity of interferon, binding to viral proteins, and interfering with viral nucleic acid synthesis by binding to the viral polymerases. Another flavonoid, kaempferol is active against HSV, human coronavirus and rotavirus replication 17 .Silymarin, extracted from milk thistle (Silybum marianum), was shown to inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) in both in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting HCV entry, RNA synthesis, viral protein expression and infectious virus production; in addition it also acts by blocking of the virus cell-to-cell spread 18 . It becomes our concern to explain the definition for the nomenclature of 'milk thistle extract' , 'silymarin' and 'silibinin' since the findings that will be discussed further involve these three important terms. In brief, the initial extract of the crushed milk thistle seeds made up of 65-80% silymarin and 20-35% fatty acids, such as linoleic acid. Silymarin itself, is a complex of more than 7 flavonolignans (silybin A, silybin B, isosilybin A, isosilybin B, silychristin, isosilychristin and silydianin) and 1 flavonoid whereas silibinin is a semi-purified, commercially available fraction of silymarin, with an approximate 1:1 mixture of 2 diastereoisomeric compounds, silybin A and silybin B which are also referred to in the literature as silibinin A and B 19 .Here we evaluated in vitro antiviral activity of quercetin, kaempferol and silymarin against a clinical isolate of CHIKV. Our results support the antiviral properties of silymarin as a promising compound for further investigations towards the development of an anti-CHIKV drug.  Results  Cytotoxicity of flavonoids. The MTS assay was used to determine cytotoxicity of each flavonoid for Vero and BHK cells. The CC 50 value of each compound was calculated (Table 1 ). There was no observed Antiviral activity assay. Primary screening. Different non-cytotoxic concentrations of silymarin, kaempferol and quercetin were tested on CHIKV-infected Vero cells to find the effective compound. A CPE inhibition assay was used at 48 hpi. It was shown that 100 μ g/ml of silymarin significantly inhibited the CHIKV-CPE presentation (P = 0.0007) (Fig. 1a) . This finding was not unexpected as silybin (also known as silibinin) is one of the components of silymarin and has been shown to possess anti-CHIKV activity 20 . In contrast, the highest concentrations of quercetin and kaempferol only exhibited 25% CPE inhibitory activity (Fig. 1a) . The results of CPE inhibition assay were further confirmed by using MTS assay (Fig. 1b) .Silymarin inhibits early post-entry stages of CHIKV replication. From analyzed compounds only silymarin was able to suppress CHIKV mediated cytotoxicity. Therefore it was chosen for a time-of-addition assay performed with aim to determine which stage of virus infection cycle this compound affected.As it is shown in Fig. 2 the inhibition was most efficient when silymarin was added at 2 hpi. The time-dependence of inhibitory effect of compound is coherent with hypothesis that its anti-CHIKV activity may be due inhibition of some early, but probably post-entry, step of CHIKV replication cycle. Anti-entry assay has also been performed and the result has clearly shown that there is no antiviral activity of silymarin against CHIKV at the anti-entry phase (Fig. 3 ).  Evaluation of antiviral effect of silymarin using CHIKV replicon cell line. The CHIKV replicon  cell line contained non-cytotoxic replicon of CHIKV which, in addition to the virus replicase proteins, expresses also puromycin acetyl transferase, EGFP and Rluc markers 20 . In this system the Rluc activity is proportional to viral replicon RNA replication. It was found that 100 μ g/ml of silymarin suppressed the activity of Rluc marker expressed by the CHIKV replicon by 93.4% (Fig. 4) . The inhibition was highly significant (P = 0.016) confirming that silymarin affects post-entry steps of CHIKV infection. This data also indicates that silymarin can interfere with CHIKV RNA replication by affecting the viral replicase system. Interestingly, in previous study 20 IC 50 of silybin, one of the major components of silymarin, was estimated as 59.8 μ M (approximately 30 μ g/ml). Compared to this silymarin was somewhat more efficient as nearly three-fold inhibition was observed at 25 μ g/ml indicating that other components of silymarin likely contributed to its anti-CHIKV activity.  Silymarin interferes with post-entry stages of CHIKV infection in a dose dependent manner.  To confirm the post-entry antiviral activity of silymarin against CHIKV a virus yield assay using qRT-PCR was used. The CHIKV RNA copy number in supernatants of cells treated with each concentration of inhibitor and that from the control cells was interpreted and depicted (Fig. 5 ). There is a significant reduction of CHIKV replication as treated with increasing concentrations of silymarin (P = 0.0199), Silymarin exhibits a statistically significant (P < 0.05) dose-dependent inhibition on the Rluc activity produced by BHK-CHIKV-NCT replicon. The Rluc activity was measured at 48 h post treatment. Vehicletreated (0.1% DMSO) cells were used as control ("0") concentration). Data from triplicate assays were plotted and analyzed from a non-parametric correlation (Spearman) two-tailed test (Graph Pad Prism Version 5, Graph Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). as compared to the vehicle control treated cells. Based on this data it was calculated that silymarin had IC 50 = 16.9 μ g/ml with Selectivity Index (SI) of 25.1. Taking into account that adding silymarin 2 hpi showed significant inhibitory effect against CHIKV replication confirms that silymarin acts at the post-entry stage of CHIKV infection. In contrast, in similar assay neither kaempferol nor quercetin showed any significant inhibitory effect against CHIKV replication (Fig. 5) . As it is shown in Fig. 5 , 100 μ g/ml of silymarin can inhibit the CHIKV yield by more than 99%.To evaluate whether the silymarin also affects the CHIKV protein synthesis, a series of western blot analyses were performed using lysates of the CHIKV infected and silymarin treated Vero cells (Fig. 6 ). As it is evident from constant levels of β actin, silymarin treatment did not result in protein degradation and, at used concentrations, the compound was not toxic for the Vero cells. In contrast, dose-dependent reduction of amounts of nsP1, nsP3 and E2 proteins was observed (Fig. 6) indicating that silymarin limited CHIKV replication and virus-encoded protein synthesis within the treated cells.Silybin interferes with early post-entry of CHIKV infection in dose-dependent manner. Questioned by whether the silymarin effects on the CHIKV replication are influenced by the fractions it is made up of, since the study done by Pohjala L. et al., 2011 has proved that the silybin (one of the silymarin fraction) can suppressed the activities of Rluc marker gene expressed by the CHIKV replicon, we have evaluated the effect of silybin against CHIKV intracellular replication. Hence, silybin was tested for its early post-entry activity and we confirmed its anti-CHIKV activity in a dose-dependent manner with the IC 50 of 69.7 µg/ml, which is higher than the IC 50 of silymarin. This result makes us to conclude that the activity of silymarin against CHIKV replication might also be enhanced by other components or fractions that made it up.  Discussion  Considering the crippling pains that persist for weeks and even years due to CHIKV infections and the absence of antiviral treatment for the virus, the search for effective antiviral compounds is imperative. Due to their known broad spectrum anti-viral activity and low toxicity, we evaluated three flavonoids as viable candidate compounds 21 . From these compounds only silymarin was identified as the flavonoid with significant anti-CHIKV activity. It was considered that it has potential for future development as its use results in ≥ 70% reduction of CHIKV infection based on CPE inhibition and MTS assays (Fig. 1) . Remarkably, the effective concentration of silymarin was much lower than MNTD. In contrast, neither kaempferol nor quercetin showed significant antiviral activity against in vitro replication of CHIKV in both assays.To quantify the copy number of viral RNA released (most probably in form of genomic RNA packed into virions) from infected cells were used qRT-PCR and amplified part of nsP3 encoding region of CHIKV genome. Since nsP3 which is involved in the negative-strand and subgenomic RNA synthesis, the quantification of the negative-strand RNA reflects the active viral replication, we selected the nsP3 as the gene target for qRT-PCR to quantify the virus load during replication [22] [23] [24] [25] . Our data demonstrated that treatment with silymarin results in effective reduction of number of released viral genome indicating reduction of viral RNA synthesis and/or virion formation and release.In post-adsorption assay silymarin taken at 100 μ g/ml resulted in ≈ 99% inhibition of CHIKV replication. We therefore performed a time-of-addition assay using this concentration of silymarin to determine the stage of infection where the silymarin treatment results in biggest antiviral effect. The result was consistent with our data from post-adsorption assay; hence it can be concluded that silymarin is most effective if it is added shortly after virus infection (2 hpi). The reason for lower anti-CHIKV activity of pretreatment with silymarin could be due to the half-life of silymarin which based on previous bioavailability study is less than 4 hours 26 , although, there is no data available on in vitro half-life or stability of silymarin which might be interesting for future studies.As our findings were consistent with hypothesis that silymarin effect on post-entry stages of CHIKV dose response analysis was also performed using a CHIKV replicon cell line where no virus entry or exit takes place. Again, it was found that silymarin is able to suppress the activity of Rluc marker expressed by CHIKV replicon. This finding is consistent with that from previous assay and confirms that silymarin suppresses CHIKV RNA replication and does it in dose-dependent manner. The Rluc, expressed by CHIKV replicon, is fused to nsP3 protein of the virus. Accordingly, reduction of Rluc activity indicates reduced amounts of nsP3-Rluc protein in CHIKV replicon cell line.To further confirmation of anti-CHIKV activity of silymarin, we have shown the effect of silymarin on viral protein synthesis in CHIKV infected cells (Fig. 5) . Again decrease of viral protein synthesis was observed. This effect could be due to inhibition of CHIKV RNA replication and/or transcription. However, as in virus expression and replicon cell lines the synthesis of viral RNAs and proteins are coupled further study is necessary to evaluate the direct effect of silymarin on inhibition of newly synthesized CHIKV proteins. It is possible that some of non-structural proteins of CHIKV represents direct target for silymarin. The possibilities include nsP1 protein, which is involved in the synthesis of the negative strand of viral RNA and RNA capping, and nsP3 protein, that is another component of the viral replicase complex. Down regulation of E2 expression may represent consequence of suppression of replication (directly or via inhibition of ns-protein(s)). However, this down regulation is clearly relevant from point of view of development of effective antiviral as E2 protein is one of the important virion glycoproteins and is essential for receptor binding. Interestingly, a previous study showed that silymarin can inhibit the expression of NS5B of hepatitis C virus (HCV) which is catalytic subunit of HCV replicase 26 . Although, the hepatoprotective property of silymarin in the context of blocking HCV infection based on in vivo studies is another important criteria for this compound to be considered as a therapeutic candidate for hepatitis C 19, 27, 28 .This study represents an important first report on the anti-CHIKV properties of silymarin. Previously other flavonoids such as apigenin, chrysin, naringenin and silybin, which are also one of components of silymarin, are known to be inhibitors of viral replication mainly through affecting important cellular elements for CHIKV replication 20 . However, inhibitory properties of silymarin are somewhat different from that of silybin. Thus our data for silymarin warrants further mechanistic studies to characterize the antiviral properties of all its components and other flavonoid compounds and head-to-head comparison of their antiviral effects at lower concentrations/ different conditions so that the best option of anti-CHIKV can be determined.  Conclusion  In summary, our study showed that silymarin exhibited significant in vitro antiviral activity against CHIKV. It suppressed post-entry stages of viral replication, most likely CHIKV RNA replication significantly with a dose dependent manner. Coherent with this the expression of proteins, needed for RNA replication, and also expression of viral structural E2 protein were down-regulated. In contrast to silymarin it was found that quercetin and kaempferol are unable to suppress CHIKV replication and accordingly are not good candidates for anti-CHIKV drugs. These findings warrant future mechanistic, in vivo anti-viral, toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies as part of the process for evaluation of silymarin as a potential anti-CHIKV therapeutic.  Materials and Methods  Virus and cells. The CHIKV isolate used in this experiment was a clinical isolate from an outbreak in Johor in 2008 coded as MY/065/08/FN295485. It belongs to the ECSA genotype and has the A226V mutation in E1 protein 29, 30 . BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney) and Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were used in this study. Vero cells have been widely used in the in vitro antiviral research for example in the antiviral testing for the chikungunya virus, human enterovirus 71 and Coxsackievirus A16 31, 32 . Both cell lines were cultured using Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, Gibco, NY, USA) containing 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin-streptomycin, and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 .The CHIKV MY/065/08/FN295485 strain was propagated in BHK-21 cells and harvested after full cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed. Virus stock titer was determined by the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) methods 33 ; then the obtained stock was aliquoted and stored at -70 °C. During the time of virus propagation and antiviral assay the FBS concentration of the cell culture medium was reduced to 2%. Vero cell line was used for further experiments such as MTS assay and antiviral assays.The CHIKV replicon cells 20 were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Gibco, NY, USA) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2% tryptose-broth phosphate and penicillin-streptomycin, and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 .Flavonoids. Silymarin, quercetin and kaempferol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and stored in − 20 °C for future use. Stock solution was diluted with EMEM and was filtered through a syringe filter with 0.2 μ m pore size (Millipore, MA, USA) at the time of use; DMSO concentration in working solutions prepared on EMEM was kept at 0.1%.  MTS  (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) assay (Promega, WI, USA) was performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of tested compounds against Vero cells and BHK21 cells according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, monolayers of Vero cells were grown in 96-well plate and were treated with different concentrations of each compound in triplicate together with negative control (media containing 0.1% DMSO). The plate was then incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 for 48 hours before the MTS assay was performed. Treated and control cells were kept for two days at 37 °C, under similar conditions and duration until used for antiviral activity assay. After two days post-treatment, MTS solution was added to the cells and incubated for 4 hours at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 prior to absorbance detection at 495 nm wavelength using Infinite 200 Pro multiplate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). All experiments were conducted in triplicate. The half maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) for each compound was determined through this assay using Graph Pad Prism 5 (Graph Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, 2005). Antiviral activity assays. Primary assay for antiviral activity. A monolayer of Vero cells were grown in 96-well plate in EMEM containing 2% inactivated FBS. The tested compounds were added to the wells in triplicate together with CHIKV at an MOI = 1. The plate was then incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 for 48 hours. The assay was conducted in duplicate for each concentration of each compound. After two days, the plate was viewed under the microscope and the degree of cytopathic effect (CPE) as measure of virus replication inhibition was expressed as the percent yield of virus control (% virus control = CPE experimental group/CPE virus control × 100). The results were confirmed by performing the MTS assay (Promega, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. All experiments were repeated three times independently. The statistical analysis on percentage of CPE inhibition was performed by using the Gaussian populations (Pearson) two-tailed assay.Anti-entry assay. The procedure of the anti-entry assay was modified and performed according to Lee RCH et. al., 2013 34 . Monolayers of Vero cells were grown in 96-well plate with EMEM supplemented with 10% inactivated FBS. The Vero cells were then infected with CHIKV and the plate was incubated for 1 hour at 4 °C. Non-adsorbed virus was then washed with 1xPBS. Tested compound was added in different concentrations and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 for 2 hours. The plate was again washed with 1xPBS and treated with citrate buffer (pH = 3) to inactivate the non-internalized virus, before the plate was again washed with 1xPBS. The EMEM supplemented with 2% inactivated FBS was added into every wells and the plate was incubated for 48 hours at 37 °C with 5% CO 2.CHIKV replicon cell line based assay. Monolayers of CHIKV replicon cells were prepared in 96-well white plate (Corning Inc, NY, USA) and treated with different concentrations of tested compounds. After 48 hours incubation at 37°C with 5% CO 2 the activity the Renilla Luciferase (Rluc), expressed by CHIKV replicon, was detected using Renilla luciferase assay (Promega, WI, USA) performed according to the manufacturer's protocols. The luminescence signal was then measured using the GloMAX 20/20 Luminometer (Promega, WI, USA), plotted against the log transformation of the concentrations of compounds and a sigmoidal curve fit with variable slope was created to obtain the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value for each compound by Graph Pad Prism 5 (Graph Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, 2005). Data were represent as the means ± standard error of the mean (SEM) from triplicate assay from three independent experiments. The statistical analysis to determine the correlation between the concentration of silymarin and the Rluc activity was performed by using non-parametric correlation (Spearman) two-tailed assay.Time-of-addition assay. In this experiment, a monolayer of Vero cells were grown in 96-well plate in EMEM containing 2% inactivated FBS. The wells (in triplicate) were designated as − 2, − 1, 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8-hour, that they are named according to the time of CHIKV (MOI = 1) infection. As for − 2 hour, Vero cells were treated with 100 μ g/ml of silymarin. The plate was then incubated for one hour at 37 °C with 5% CO 2. One hour later, − 1 hour wells were also treated with 100 μ g/ml of silymarin. At the 0 hour, all wells except the control wells were infected with CHIKV and again incubated for one hour at 37 °C with 5% CO 2. After 2-hour incubation and for every 2-hour after incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO 2, 100 μ g/ml silymarin were added to − 2, 4, 6 and 8 hour wells respectively. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 for 48 hours.The supernatant of the treated and control wells (treated with 0.1% DMSO was used as vehicle control) were collected two days post-treatment and analyzed using qRT-PCR. The half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) of silymarin was calculated using Graph Pad Prism 5 (Graph Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, 2005). All data are from triplicate assay from three independent experiments.Quantitative reverse transcription PCR(qRT-PCR). A qRT-PCR assay was used to quantify the CHIKV RNA copy number. For this amplification of 136 base region of nsP3 encoding sequence was performed as described by Chiam and colleagues 35 . The primers were nsP3-F(5'-GCGCGTAAGTCCAAGGGAAT-3') and nsP3-R (5'-AGCATCCAGGTCTGACGGG-3'). The cDNA was first generated from the RNA extracted from the supernatants (QIAGEN, Germany) of the previous assays plate, using nsP3-R primer and Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The unincorporated primers were then digested with 20U of Exonuclease I (New England Biolabs, USA). The qRT-PCR was performed with a Step-OnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, USA) with 2 × Power SYBRGreen PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies, USA), following the manufacturer's protocol, and using serially diluted standards. Cycling parameters were 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The amplified product was verified by melting curve analysis. The statistical analysis to determine the correlation between the RNA copy number and the silymarin concentration was performed by using the Gaussian populations (Pearson) two-tailed assay.Western blotting. Vero cells at the density of 3 × 10 6 cells were seeded into a 75 cm 2 flask in EMEM containing 2% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. The next day, each flask was infected with CHIKV inoculum at an MOI = 1, placed on a rocker for 30 minutes, and then incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 for 2 h. Then each flask was treated with different concentrations (100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25 μ g/ml) of the trial compound, control flasks were treated with solutions containing 0.1% DMSO. All the flasks were then incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 until the appearance of CPE in the vehicle control. Once CPE was observed, cells were scraped, washed with PBS and lysed using 300 μ l of 1% Triton X100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 4 °C for 45 min. Cellular debris was pelleted out by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. A Micro BCA TM Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) was used to quantify the protein concentration for each sample. Lysate containing 100 μ g of protein were denatured using SDS-loading buffer and proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE in 12% gels. The gels were then equilibrated in Towbin buffer (0.025 M Tris, 0.192 M glycine 20% methanol) for 10 min and proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane using the Bio-Rad wet transfer system (Bio Rad, San Francisco, CA). For detection of nsP1 and nsP3, membranes were blocked with 1X PBS 1% Casein Blocker (Bio Rad, San Francisco, CA) for 1 h at room temperature on a shaker. The blots were rinsed three times with 1X PBS Tween20 before being incubated with primary anti-CHIKV nsP1, anti-CHIKV nsP3 or anti-CHIKV E2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies in 1% casein solution. The blots were then washed three times with 1X PBS Tween20 for 15 min each time. This was followed by incubation with the secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 1 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker. Membranes were washed three times with PBS containing Tween 20 for 15 minutes each time. For the loading control, separate blots containing the same samples were incubated with primary anti-β-actin mouse monoclonal antibody conjugated with HRP (Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA) dissolved in 1% Casein for 1 hour at room temperature on shaker. The blots were then washed three times with 1X PBS Tween 20 for 15 minutes each time.

27095520	Structural characterization of recombinant IAV polymerase reveals a stable complex between viral PA-PB1 heterodimer and host RanBP5	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4837377/	The genome of influenza A virus (IAV) comprises eight RNA segments (vRNA) which are transcribed and replicated by the heterotrimeric IAV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp). RdRp consists of three subunits (PA, PB1 and PB2) and binds both the highly conserved 3′- and 5′-ends of the vRNA segment. The IAV RdRp is an important antiviral target, but its structural mechanism has remained largely elusive to date. By applying a polyprotein strategy, we produced RdRp complexes and define a minimal human IAV RdRp core complex. We show that PA-PB1 forms a stable heterodimeric submodule that can strongly interact with 5′-vRNA. In contrast, 3′-vRNA recognition critically depends on the PB2 N-terminal domain. Moreover, we demonstrate that PA-PB1 forms a stable and stoichiometric complex with host nuclear import factor RanBP5 that can be modelled using SAXS and we show that the PA-PB1-RanPB5 complex is no longer capable of 5′-vRNA binding. Our results provide further evidence for a step-wise assembly of IAV structural components, regulated by nuclear transport mechanisms and host factor binding.	  Structural studies of RdRp from the human infecting influenza A (human-IAV) strains in contrast, have been limited to date, partly due to difficulties to produce recombinant H3N2 or H5N1 polymerases. Nonetheless, a cryo-EM reconstruction was recently obtained of a truncated influenza A/H5N1 polymerase 13 . In the present article, we identify PB2 as the main bottleneck hampering complete recombinant polymerase expression in our insect cells expression system. Moreover, we present the characterisation of several constructs of human-IAV RdRp, including the biologically relevant PA-PB1 heterodimer in solution. The titration measurements against the 5′-and 3′-vRNA promoters show a strong sub-nanomolar affinity of the PA-PB1 heterodimer towards the 5′-vRNA whereas the specific binding of the 3′-vRNA requires the presence of PB2. By applying our co-expression strategy, we show that the previously proposed PA-PB1-RanBP5 import complex can be purified, which we characterise using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Biochemical analysis of this complex reveals a role for RanBP5 in hindering 5′-vRNA binding. Taken together, these data provide evidence for a cellular RdRp assembly pathway following a sequential and conditional process of assembly.  Results  PB2 is a key limiting factor for recombinant expression of the heterotrimer. Polyproteins are naturally used by certain viruses to structure their proteome 14, 15 . Recombinant polyproteins mimicking viral polyproteins have recently emerged as a powerful tool to express protein complexes for functional characterisation as well as structural determination (reviewed in 16 ) . Using this strategy 17 , soluble and active heterotrimeric RNAdependent RNA-polymerases of influenza B virus (IBV) and bat influenza A (bat-IAV) virus could be produced, crystallized and the structure determined at high resolution 5, 6 . We have applied a similar strategy to the RdRp of two human-IAV strains, A/Victoria/3/1975(H3N2) and the highly pathogenic A/Viet-Nam/1203/2004(H5N1). The three genes of each heterotrimeric complex were combined with Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease and Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP) in a single large open reading frame (ORF). Each gene was separated by a DNA sequence encoding for a peptide segment comprising a short serine/glycine linker and a TEV protease cleavage site ( Fig. 1a and supplementary Figure 1 ). The constructs were optimized for recombinant expression in insect Deposits feature total lysate after freeze/thaw (T), supernatant after centrifugation (S), resin flow through (Ft) and the primary elution fraction (E). After migration on a 12% SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred on PVDF membrane. Primary antibodies targeting human-IAV PB2 (rabbit IgG) and human-IAV PB1 (mouse IgG) have been used. Revelation was performed with secondary goat antibodies coupled with Alexa Fluor 532 (λ exi = 632 nm, λ emi = 647 nm) and Alexa Fluor 633 (λ exi = 531 nm, λ emi = 554 nm) targeting mouse and rabbit H + L domains respectively, using a Typhoon Trio imaging system (GE Healthcare). After integration of the raw data, PB1 and PB2 revelation are visible in red and green respectively. Black and white signal of PB2 is also shown (bottom) to highlight the PB2 truncations. The upper bands appearing in green/yellow, correspond to unprocessed polyproteins.Scientific RepoRts | 6:24727 | DOI: 10.1038/srep24727 cells using the MultiBac system 18, 19 . During expression, the TEV protease cleaves the polyprotein co-translationally, resulting in a stoichiometric assembly of the RdRp that can then be selectively purified using an affinity nickel resin. The production of the polyprotein is monitored using the fluorescence of two reporter proteins: CFP encoded within the polyprotein reports directly on recombinant protein yield, while YFP, integrated in the baculovirus genome, monitors virus performance 19 . The ratio of YFP/CFP in our system is a highly useful criterion to determine recombinant polyprotein translation efficacy of the different constructs. Table 1 summarizes the results obtained with all constructs tested. Several attempts were made to express the H3N2 polymerase heterotrimer (construct number 12, Table 1 ). Although YFP and CFP can be detected and quantified, CFP values were extremely low compared to YFP with a YFP/CFP ratio of 50, the highest observed for any polyprotein constructs that we expressed. No clear bands were observed on western blot using specific PA, PB1 and PB2 antibodies. Similar results were obtained with the H5N1 RdRp polyprotein, indicating failure of these recombinant expression experiments for these full-length IAV heterotrimeric polymerases. As a comparison, using the same strategy, the YFP/CFP ratio for the expression of IBV or Bat-IAV heterotrimer was close to 20, similar to the ratios we obtained for the expressions of constructs 13 and 15 (i.e. without most of PB2).In order to understand the difference between the expression of the human-IAV and IBV polymerases, we designed new constructs with a C-terminally truncated PB2 based on available structural information. These were PB2(1-36) 20 , PB2(1-116) 21 and based on the cap-binding domain 22 , PB2(322-483). Expression and purification experiments were undertaken on constructs 15, 17 and 18, all of which all have full-length PA, PB1 and truncations of PB2 extending to residues 116, 320 and 483 respectively (Fig. 1b) . As the PB2 extension increases beyond residue 116, we observed a loss of expression of the polyprotein, thus identifying a critical region in PB2 that limits yield. This can first of all be observed through the monitoring of YFP/CFP reporter genes during expression (Fig. 1c) . YFP fluorescence values reach a similar plateau for all constructs whereas CFP values are reduced significantly for constructs 17 and 18. Moreover, after nickel resin pull-down on lysates from an equal amount of cells, we observed by western blot (Fig. 1d ) decreased intensity bands of not only PB2 but also PB1, indicative of an overall expression loss. Polyprotein size increase alone could not explain the reduced expression because other control constructs (19 and 20) with additional protein sequences beyond PB2 residue 116 conserve lower YFP/CFP ratios. Furthermore, replacing the PB2(1-116) by another large protein such as RanBP5 (residues 1-1115) generates a construct with a lower YFP/CFP ratio than construct 15. The analysis of the amino acids sequences of PB2 does not provide more indication on the real nature of this phenomenon (supplementary Figure 2 ). To determine whether this "loss-of-expression" phenomenon results from our polyprotein expression strategy, which combines PA-PB1 and PB2 in one ORF, we generated a MultiBac baculovirus co-expressing a PA-PB1 fusion and PB2 from an independent expression cassette 23 . This strategy also resulted in high YFP/CFP ratios (≥ 35), even though the CFP gene was only fused to PA-PB1. These results identify PB2, especially when extended beyond the residue 116, as the bottleneck for expression of complete human-IAV RdRp.Dissecting the heterotrimer. In order to identify a minimal active core of the human-IAV polymerase, we have systematically dissected the heterotrimeric complex for further characterisation using the polyprotein strategy. The expression of PA-PB1 increases significantly when PB2 is totally removed (compare constructs 1 and 13/15; Table 1 ). The same observation is made after removing the endonuclease domain (i.e. PA-Nter; compare constructs 14 and 13/15). After purification, PA-PB1 forms homogeneous monomeric and stable particles (Fig. 2b) whereas the complexes with PB2 (constructs 15 and 16) give rise to dimers in solution (Fig. 2a) . The dimers are stable enough to withstand salt concentrations up to 2 M NaCl during purification, but the SEC elution peaks are broad suggesting that the oligomerization process is quite dynamic. By adding vRNA promoter-like molecules (e.g. the IAV panhandle) 24 , we found that the dimers dissociated into monomeric RNA:protein complexes. We were able to show that the truncated PA-PB1 (construct 1) and the PA-PB1-PB2 (construct 14) exhibit expected polymerase activities. The endonuclease activity is similar to that of the isolated PA-Nter domain (supplementary Figure 3 ), can be inhibited by the same point mutation (i.e. PA-E80A) or compound (i.e. DPBA) and shows comparable dependency on manganese 25, 26 . The constructs are also functional in RNA synthesis. Upon addition of a mixture of IAV panhandle, NTPs and [α -32 P]-UTP, both truncated PA-PB1 and PA-PB1-PB2 are able to generate an 80-nucleotide long product plus other minor products in absence or in presence of ApG (supplementary Figure 4) .We have also shown that further N-terminally truncating PA and/or C-terminally truncating PB1 has no impact on the expression of the corresponding polyproteins (constructs 1 to 11). The heterodimer PA-PB1 can be purified with or without the N-terminal domain of PA (i.e. PA-Nter; compare constructs 1 and 2). However, as soon as the PA-hinge (residues 200-260) is removed, PB1 becomes insoluble. This implies that the PA-hinge linking the Nter-and Cter-domains of PA is crucial for the stability of PB1. However, it is not sufficient in itself since the C-terminal region of PA also interacts with the N-terminal part of PB1 27,28 and cannot be deleted either (compare constructs 2 and 5 to 11). PB1 can be shortened on its C-terminus but when purifying the construct 4 (i.e. PB1 until amino acid 560), only PA-Cter remains soluble. Thus, the minimal construct required to obtain soluble PB1 is construct 3 with PA from 197 to 716 and PB1 from 1 to 660. All the PA-PB1 constructs without the N-terminal domain of PA form dimers in solution (supplementary Figure 5 ) and adding vRNA-like molecules has no incidence on the dimerization.Over all the constructs tested, crystals have only been obtained using construct 2 (PA from 197 to 716 and PB1 from 1 to 686). Crystals grew in a few days in low PEG content solutions. They diffract poorly, with diffraction limited to typically ≈ 10 Å.PA-PB1 dimer exhibits high-affinity interaction with 5′-vRNA but requires PB2 for binding 3′-vRNA. All influenza RNA segments have the same organization, a central coding region flanked by 2 un-translated regions containing the highly conserved and complementary 5′-and 3′-ends [29] [30] [31] . The viral polymerase specifically interacts with both the 5′-and 3′-ends, as recently visualized in crystal structures 5, 6 , and uses them as a promoter 1-3 . During their biochemical characterisation, we have seen significant effects of vRNA-like RNA molecules on the stability and/or the oligomeric state of most of the constructs. The initial RNA molecule used was the 80-nt panhandle 24 from which we made the 5′-vRNAp corresponding to the 5′-end (5′-AGUAGAAACAAGGGUA) and it's 3′ equivalent called 3′-vRNAp (AUACCCUGCUUUUGCU-3′). By thermal shift assay experiments, a 10 °C stabilisation was observed when 5′-vRNAp was added to all the constructs, whereas when 3′-vRNAp was added, the effect was less significant and dependent on the construct. Similar data had already been published 32 .We used fluorescence anisotropy to measure the interaction between our truncated polymerase constructs and the conserved vRNA ends by following the fluorescence polarization increase of a fluorescently labelled RNA when it binds the polymerase. For this purpose, we used 5′-vRNAp and 3′-vRNAp, both labelled with fluorescein amidite (FAM) at the opposite extremity of the putative interaction, i.e. at the 3′-end for the 5′-vRNAp and vice versa ( Fig. 3 and Table 2 ). At 300 mM NaCl, the Kd for the 5′-vRNAp are similar (sub-nanomolar) for both constructs 1 and 14, whereas for the 3′-vRNAp, a Kd of 36 nM for the construct with PB2 is obtained (Fig. 3a ) and no binding was observed for the construct without PB2 (Fig. 3c ). As the estimated Kd for the 5′-end was in a range below the working concentration and beyond the sensitivity limit of the fluorescence anisotropy measurement, another method was required to determine the 5′-vRNAp affinity. Filter binding assays (FBA) were then therefore used for precise Kd determination (Fig. 3b) . With the corresponding radioactive probes, we found values of 0.2-0.4 nM for the 5′-end. For the 3′-end, the Kd was 100-fold higher and critically dependent on the presence of PB2. Salt concentration is also an important parameter. We show different binding characteristics at 150 and 300 mM NaCl of the PA-PB1 towards different RNAs. The Kd value of PA-PB1 for the 5′-end remains sub-nanomolar in the range of 150 to 300 mM NaCl. In contrast, at 150 mM NaCl, 3′-vRNAp binds to PA-PB1 with the same affinity than for a poly-UC (Fig. 3c) , and so is non-specific. All relevant titrations were performed at 300 mM NaCl to prevent non-specific affinity measurements. Recently published affinity data 33 working at 500 mM NaCl likewise consistent with very high affinity of the 5′-vRNAp towards IAV polymerase but this study failed to measure 3′-vRNAp binding within the nanomolar range, indicating that 3′-vRNAp binding is also tightly influenced by salt concentration. Whereas PB2 and NP use importins-α 9,34-37 , PA and PB1 are conjointly imported as a preformed heterodimeric submodule by the importin-β RanBP5 10, 12, 38 . Having confirmed the existence of a stable PA-PB1 complex we sought to demonstrate its interaction with RanPB5. The human IPO5 gene which encodes for RanBP5, was expressed in insect cells. After purification, RanBP5 forms a homogeneous monomeric sample (Fig. 2c ) that has been used in mixing experiments with freshly purified PA-PB1(1-686) followed by SEC-MALLS-RI experiments. The two samples were mixed in stoichiometric ratio and incubated before size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Both RanBP5 and PA-PB1(1-686) were eluted in the same single peak, but MALLS-RI indicated a molecular weight corresponding of a mixture rather than a stable ternary complex (supplementary Figure 6 ). We then attempted to produce a PA-PB1(1-686)-RanBP5 heterotrimer by the self-processing polyprotein strategy. A long ORF encoding for the trimeric complex was created by inserting the IPO5 gene downstream of the PB1(1-686) coding sequence (Table 1, construct 21) . Remarkably, from this polyprotein construct, PA-PB1 co-purifies with RanBP5, forming a homogeneous and stable heterotrimer (Fig. 2d) . (Fig. 4a) shows a visually adequate correlation with the CRYSOL curve which uses the bat-IAV polymerase structure (PDB id: 4WSB) as a model. To evaluate the statistical similarity between experimental intensities and those computed from a model has been derived. The high chi 2 values are observed for this dataset, due to a noisy SAXS curve. A slight deviation of the fit is observed above a q range of 0.8 nm −1 , suggesting conformational differences between the scattering curve and the crystal structure coordinates. Ab-initio modelling was performed using 15 DAMMIF models which were averaged by DAMAVER. Averaged model correlation with the diffusion curve was then checked using the damstart file as a starting envelope for DAMMIN. The polymerase DAMAVER envelope (Fig. 4a) appears as a pear shaped structure in which the homologous model can be fitted. Additional envelope volume is visible close to the endonuclease domain, implying that it adopts multiple conformations in solution.Using the same methodology, we determine RanBP5 to be a monomer in solution with a measured Mw of 144 kDa close to the theoretical Mw of 126 kDa (Table 3 karyopherin Kap121 40 to be the closest homologue available for RanBP5 (30% sequence identity over 1027 residues). CRYSOL curve fitting using the apo form of Kap121 (PDB id: 3W3T) against the diffusion curve reveals important structural and conformational differences between the two structures (Fig. 4b) . However, envelope modelling confirms an elongated structure of RanBP5 in solution, comparable in size with yeast Kap121 in the crystal structure. curves with the ab-initio DAMMIN curve fit (blue) using the Damstart (DAMAVER) as an initial constraint and the CRYSOL fit (red) of the closest homologous X-ray structure. The MONSA fit is also shown for PA-PB1-RanBP5 in black. The Chi 2 , to evaluate the statistical similarity between experimental intensities and those computed from a model, are also shown. On the right, the homologous PDB structure of PA-PB1(1-686) from Bat-IAV polymerase is depicted in cartoon and fitted in both the DAMAVER and the MONSA generated envelops of PA-PB1(1-686) which are depicted in grey. PA is coloured in blue, PB1 in green and the NLS of PB1 in magenta. The DAMAVER and MONSA envelop of RanBp5 is coloured in purple. As a comparison, the atomic structure of Kap123P (pdb is: 3W3T) is depicted in cartoon with a sky blue colour alongside the DAMAVER envelop of RanBP5. All envelopes and models are adjusted at the same size scale.Scientific RepoRts | 6:24727 | DOI: 10.1038/srep24727 presence of a stoichiometric 1:1:1 PA-PB1(1-686)-RanBP5 complex in solution. MONSA builds ab initio shapes using the scattering curves for complexes together with those of their individual components 41 . MONSA was used to perform the ab-initio modelling of the complex PA-PB1(1-686)-RanBP5 (supplementary Figure 8) . It separately uses the PA-PB1(1-686) and RanBP5 diffusion curves (Fig. 4a,b) in combination with that of PA-PB1(1-686)-RanBP5 to propose a consensus dual envelope (Fig. 4c) . Model fitting was performed against the three experimental curves and matches all 3 curves with similar quality. With this ab-initio modelling we also find a comparable envelope for PA-PB1(1-686) like the one produced with DAMMIF/DAMAVER. RanBP5 on the other hand displays a different envelope suggesting conformational differences between the unbound and bound forms of RanBP5. The model suggests a close interaction between the two proteins, RanBP5 (violet envelope) interacts with PA-PB1(1-686) (grey envelope), suggesting molecular contacts well beyond those of the proposed PB1 nuclear localization signal (NLS) containing domain, which the crystal structure shows is a mobile and solvent exposed β -ribbon 6 . This model further supports the hypothesis that RanBP5 may play a chaperone function for PA-PB1 prior to assembly with PB2 in the nucleus to complete the polymerase.RanBP5 regulates the binding of the 5′-vRNAp. The PA-PB1 complex not only exists as a stable submodule but can moreover recognise the 5′-vRNAp with a high affinity and acts as a replicase and endonuclease on its own, without PB2 present. The current model predicts the NLS of PA-PB1 to be present within PB1 (residues 187-211) 12 , at the end of a beta-strand located parallel to the vRNAp binding sites, indicating a potential link between the binding to RanBP5 and/or the binding to vRNAp.Subsequently to measuring the sub-nanomolar Kd of PA-PB1(1-686) and PA-PB1-PB2(1-116) to the 5′-vRNAp, an identical experiment was performed with the PA-PB1(1-686)-RanBP5 complex (Fig. 3d) . The association curve clearly shows a complete loss of binding affinity towards the 5′-vRNAp when RanBP5 is present, both at 300 mM and 150 mM NaCl. Using SEC-MALLS-RI experiments, we have shown that an excess of 5′-vRNAp does not induce any complex dissociation of the PA-PB1(1-686)-RanBP5 trimer (supplementary Figure 9 ). Taken together, these experiments suggest that RanBP5 binding obscures the 5′-vRNAp binding site, thus blocking specific 5′-vRNAp binding.  Discussion  Expression of full-length IBV and bat-IAV polymerases has been successfully achieved using a polyprotein approach, resulting in atomic resolution structures by X-ray crystallography 5, 6 . In marked contrast and unexpectedly, efficient expression of active full-length human or avian IAV polymerase at yields high enough for structural studies has not been reported to date, irrespective of the method used. Our studies identify PB2, and notably residues 120 to 250 as responsible for this poor expression. Interestingly, attempts by a different research group to reconstitute a full IAV polymerase (e.g. full IAV polymerase expression/purification for structural studies) likewise failed beyond the N-terminal PB1 interacting domain of PB2 13 . Furthermore, the recent bat-IAV, IBV and ICV RdRp crystal structures have shown that PB2 can adopt a plethora of conformations, demonstrating how dynamic PB2 is within the heterotrimer [5] [6] [7] 42, 43 . The reason why PB2 hinders polyprotein expression is not clear at the moment. We speculate that the extended fold of the PB2 region 1-250 is unstable unless bound to one side of PB1 5,6 and thus may require chaperones to maintain its stability prior to assembly onto PA-PB1. Of note, Hsp90 has been shown to stimulate influenza virus RNA synthesis 44 and the nuclear import of the subunits 35 . Moreover, Hsp90 inhibitors reduce influenza virus replication in cell culture 45 . We have shown previously that provision of co-factors in trans can ameliorate the quality and quantity of target proteins expressed in the baculovirus/insect cell system 46, 47 . Provision of Hsp90 and the other chaperones, within the polyprotein or in trans on the baculovirus backbone, may provide a powerful handle to overcome the bottleneck of human-AIV polymerase production. Furthermore, although the cellular context between viral infection and the expression of recombinant proteins is different, it cannot be excluded that the polyprotein interferes with the cellular innate immunity. IAV RdRp, and PB2 in particular, has been shown to regulate host anti-viral response through the binding to IPS-1 and the inhibition of interferon β production 48 .PA-PB1 can be produced as a stable submodule and forms a discrete heterodimer in solution. Dimerization of PA-PB1 heterodimers can appear when either the endonuclease is removed or the N-terminal of PB2 is added which may indicate that the superstructure formation could be artificially induced by truncations of the full-length polymerase. PA-PB1 can specifically bind to the 5′-vRNAp with sub-nanomolar affinity in solution. In contrast, 3′-vRNAp binding requires the presence of PB2 and is within the low nanomolar range, indicating a much stronger preference of the polymerase towards the 5′-vRNAp. These results are consistent with the high-resolution crystal structures in which the 5′-vRNAp binding site is located between the PA and PB1 subunits 5,6 . The 3′-vRNA, on the other hand, interacts with all three subunits suggesting a sequential vRNAp binding mechanism.Our results corroborate key steps of influenza polymerase assembly 10, 38, 49 . Purification of stoichiometric complexes using the polyprotein strategy confirms that PA-PB1 can exist as a preformed and stable submodule, independently of additional host factors, with PA acting as a putative "chaperone" for PB1. Our data also shows that PA-PB1 is functional in RNA synthesis, which has interesting physiological implications. Moreover, we demonstrate here that the PA-PB1(1-686) heterodimer can assemble with RanBP5 into a stable, heterotrimeric complex that can be purified in vitro. This likely corresponds to the import complex for these two subunits, although other chaperones such as HSP90 may be co-imported 35 . In contrast to PA-PB1 with RanBP5, we failed to reconstitute a binary PB2-importin-α complex using the polyprotein strategy even though functional and structural data show that PB2 nuclear import depends on the importin-α pathway, through a direct interaction between the PB2 C-terminal domain that contains the NLS 8, 9 . This is probably partly due to an inherent instability of isolated IAV PB2 in insect cells but could also reflect the lack of sufficient chaperones, co-chaperones or other unidentified factors that stabilise PB2. Furthermore, cytoplasmic expression of PB2 appears to destabilise many cellular processes 50, 51 . We also still do not know the reason for the difference in the import pathway usage between the PA-PB1 submodule and PB2. The lack of high expression levels of fully assembled PA-PB1-PB2 heterotrimers unfortunately currently limits our efforts to elucidate the structure of the complete human IAV polymerase at atomic resolution. Nevertheless, docking of bat-IAV and IBV crystal structures into the PA-PB1(1-686)-RanBP5 SAXS envelope suggests that assembly of PB2 onto the PA-PB1-RanBP5 complex might be possible, based on steric considerations. Indeed RanBP5 could even facilitate trimer assembly perhaps concomitantly with Ran-dependent dissociation from PA-PB1. In contrast, RanBP5 profoundly affects the ability of PA-PB1 to bind vRNA. We show that whereas the 5′-vRNA is specifically recognized by PA-PB1 with high affinity, this is abolished in the ternary complex with RanBP5. This again suggests that RanBP5 disassociation may be coupled to assembly of the polymerase with the promoter RNA. In any case, only when PB2 associates is the polymerase able to associate with the 3′-vRNA end, consistent with the crystal structures 5, 6 . But surprisingly, the affinity of the heterotrimer for 3′-vRNA is in the same order of magnitude than the affinity of NP for RNA substrates (Table 2) , revealing a potential competition between the complete polymerase heterotrimer and the nucleoprotein.We demonstrate here for the first time that the polyprotein expression strategy can be used not only to co-express subunits that form a stable complex, but also to successfully reconstitute interactions with downstream partner proteins in vivo in the expression host for direct purification and functional characterisation. Functional studies on IAV RdRp reveal that vRNAp promoter binding is completely abolished when PA-PB1(1-686) is bound to RanBP5, suggesting a possible role for RanBP5 in maintaining PA-PB1 in an inactive form during nuclear import. This discovery holds a promise for influenza research as it provides a novel point of therapeutic intervention for targeting and inhibiting influenza virus during assembly of its active components. We anticipate that compounds which block polymerase/RanBP5 binding or release may prove to be highly efficient, broad spectrum antiviral inhibitors in the treatment of influenza, in particular for patient groups where classical vaccination strategies fail.  Molecular biology.  To avoid expression of alternative proteins, all the genes used for this work are synthetic genes, codon optimised for insect cells expression. The DNA coding sequences of A/Victoria/3/1975(H3N2), the highly pathogenic A/Viet-Nam/1203/2004(H5N1) polymerase subunits and human IPO5 have been ordered to GeneArt (ThermoFisher Scientific), optimized for the expression in insect cells. Cloning has been achieved following the supplier procedures (New England Biolabs). The pPBAC plasmid was used for the polyprotein constructs 16, 18 . Few constructs have been expressed using pFastBac-HTB (Life Technologies). vRNA-like molecules (i.e. IAV panhandle) 24 have been produced and purified using classical in vitro transcription protocols 52,53 . Expression and purification. Large scale suspension cultures expressing polymerase fusion constructs were prepared using High Five insect cells grown in Express Five media (Life Technologies) at 0.5 × 10 6 cells/mL infected at 0.2% (V/V) with the baculovirus mother solution. Cultures were maintained at 0.5-1 × 10 6 cells/mL until proliferation arrest (24-48 h after infection). Following the proliferation arrest YFP and CFP measurements were performed every 12 h until a fluorescence plateau was reached (72-96 h after infection). Cultures were then spun down at 800 g for 10 min and cell pellets were stored at − 80 °C.Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 300 mM NaCl and 2 mM β -mercaptoethanol) per 500 × 10 6 cells in the presence of EDTA-free anti-protease cocktail (complete from Roche). Lysis was performed with two cycles of freezing (− 180 °C)/thawing (26 °C) after which 10% of glycerol were added to the lysate before centrifugation (45 min, 40 000 g, 4 °C). After retrieval of the clarified lysate, 30 mM of imidazole pH 8.0 were added before loading on Ni-NTa superpose resin (Quiagen). After flowing the lysate through the resin, three wash steps with 10 column volumes (CV) of buffer A (lysis buffer with 30 mM imidazole), 10 CV of wash buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 1 M NaCl, 10% glycerol and 2 mM β -mercaptoethanol) and 10 CV of wash buffer A were performed. Elution of the bound complex was performed with 300 mM imidazole. Elution fractions containing polymerase were then pooled together and directly injected on a 5 mL Hitrap heparin resin (GE healthcare) which had previously been equilibrated with 5 CV of buffer A. After binding to the resin, a 5 CV wash was performed with buffer A before eluting with a 40 mL salt gradient on a FPLC system. The elution peak corresponding to stoichiometric polymerase assemblies was then pooled and injected on an S200 (GE healthcare) size exclusion chromatography equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM β -mercaptoethanol. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to the desired concentration using a 100 kDa concentrator. Once concentrated the protein prep could be stored by addition of 20% glycerol and flash freezing in liquid nitrogen.NP was purified using the protocol described in 54, 55 . it. After air-drying, the samples were observed in a T12 FEI electron microscope and images were taken using an Orius SC1000 CCD camera (Gtan Inc., Pleasanton, CA).  SAXS analysis.  All datasets were collected on BM29 (ESRF). The initial trials using direct sample measurement showed a slight concentration dependency of the Guinier estimated Rg. Online SEC-SAXS was therefore used for all experiments in order to limit the contribution of partially aggregated, oligomeric or dissociated protein to the experimental curve. The experimental setup consists of a High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system connected to an analytical S200 increase column (5/150 GL, GE Healthcare) followed downstream by the SAXS sample capillary. SAXS measurements were performed every second with a Pilatus 1 M detector at distance of 2.87 m allowing a q range of 0.03 to 4.5 nm with a wavelength of 0.01 nm. Following data collection, experimental curves were subtracted and analysed using Primus (ATSAS) or Scatter (Bioisis) programs suits 56 . To verify the molecular mass, the Rambo and Tainer method was used 39, 57 . Rg predictions using the Guinier extrapolation were plotted against the elution volume to select the most monodisperse part of the protein elution peak. SAXS datasets within this zone were then scaled and averaged to produce one unique I(q) curve. GNOM 58 was then used to produce a P(r) function which was subsequently used by DAMMIF 59 to generate 15 ab-initio models. DAMAVER 60 was then used to generate an average model. Consistency of the DAMAVER averaging with the original experimental curve was assessed by using DAMMIN 41 and using the damstart.pdb envelope as a starting model. Homologue PDB structure comparison was assed using Crysol 61 . Multiple diffusion curve ab-initio modelling was performed using Bunch 62 . Homologue structure fitting within the DAMAVER envelope was performed with Chimera 63 and curve representations using Graphpad (Prism).Fluorescence anisotropy assay. Equilibrium RNA binding experiments were performed with the following vRNA set synthetized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT): 5′-vRNAp (5′-pAGUAGAAACAAGG GUA-FAM3′), 3′-vRNAp (5′FAM-AUACCCUGCUUUUGCU-3′) and polyUC (5′-pUCUCUCUCUCU CUCUCUC-FAM3′). 5′-vRNA sequences were synthetized with a 5′-mono phosphate and labeled with 6-FAM in 3′OH. 3′ vRNA were labeled with FAM in 5′. Polymerase constructs was titrated into fluorescently labeled RNA using the buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM β -mercaptoethanol plus 150 mM or 300 mM NaCl) at room temperature. Initial reactions were performed with 2-4 nM of RNA with an initial volume of 600 μL to limit the dilution effect of protein addition (< 5%). Anisotropy measurements were undertaken using a PTI fluorometer equipped with automated polarizers. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 494 and 521 nm, respectively. 50 anisotropy measurements with a 1 second integration time were performed per titration point.Filter Binding Assay. Equilibrium RNA binding experiments were undertaken with the same vRNA set synthetized by IDT. vRNA were labeled with 32 P in 5′ using the T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Double filter binding was used following the previously established protocol 64 . Protein concentration was titrated against constant concentrations of vRNA (≤ 0,01 nM) within a final volume of 200 μL using the standard protein buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM β -mercaptoethanol). 180 μL were then filtered on two membranes using a 96 well Whatman Minifold dot-blot apparatus. The first membrane was Protran BA 85 membrane (Whatman) to retain the polymerase and the second one is a nylon Hybond-N + membrane (Amersham Bioscience) to retain unbound nucleic acid. Both membranes were pre-incubated 1 h at room temperature within the protein buffer prior to use. After blotting, another 180 μL of protein buffer were run through the membranes to wash any unbound RNA before letting the vacuum dry the dot-blots for 30 seconds. Both membranes were then dismounted from the dot-blot apparatus and exposed to a storage phosphor screen (BAS storage phosphor screen, GE Healthcare) overnight. Revelation of the phosphor screen was then performed with a Typhoon Trio imaging system (GE Healthcare). Dot blot phosphorescence intensity was integrated using the Image J software. A derived bound ratio was then calculated using the following formula (1):Where I bound is the integrated intensity of protein/RNA complex which is retained by the protran membrane and I free is the unbound RNA retained by the nylon Hybond-N + membrane.Binding assay data analysis. RNA binding curves were plotted with the subtracted anisotropy or Bound RNA ratio as a function of the protein concentration. Sigmoidal binding curves were fitted to the data using GraphPad (Prism) with the following two equations:(1) For the anisotropy titrations, [vRNA] ≈ Kd. Assuming a 1/1 stoichiometry the following equation (2) Where ∆ A is the change in subtracted anisotropy, ∆A T the total change of subtracted anisotropy. R T is the total vRNA concentration, E T is the total polymerase concentration at each given point and Kd is the dissociation constant.(2) In the case of filter binding assay, a single site isotherm was used as we consider that [vRNA]  Kd. This equation (3) therefor assumes an effective equality between the free polymerase concentration and the total polymerase concentration.   T T d T d  Where ∆Br is the change in binding ratio, ∆Br T is the total change in binding ratio. E T is the total polymerase concentration at every point in titration and Kd is the dissociation constant. Standard error calculations for the apparent Kd within a given condition were calculated through triplicate data measurement.  					1			
27430948	Subcellular redistribution and sequential recruitment of macromolecular components during SGIV assembly	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003786/	Virus infection consists of entry, synthesis of macromolecular components, virus assembly and release. Understanding of the mechanisms underlying each event is necessary for the intervention of virus infection in human healthcare and agriculture. Here we report the visualization of Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) assembly in the medaka haploid embryonic stem (ES) cell line HX1. SGIV is a highly infectious DNA virus that causes a massive loss in marine aquaculture. Ectopic expression of VP88GFP, a fusion between green fluorescent protein and the envelope protein VP088, did not compromise the ES cell properties and susceptibility to SGIV infection. Although VP88GFP disperses evenly in the cytoplasm of non-infected cells, it undergoes aggregation and redistribution in SGIV-infected cells. Real-time visualization revealed multiple key stages of VP88GFP redistribution and the dynamics of viral assembly site (VAS). Specifically, VP88GFP entry into and condensation in the VAS occurred within a 6-h duration, a similar duration was observed also for the release of VP88GFP-containing SGIV out of the cell. Taken together, VP088 is an excellent marker for visualizing the SGIV infection process. Our results provide new insight into macromolecular component recruitment and SGIV assembly.

INTRODUCTION  In human, viral infection causes severe infectious diseases and death such as SARS and H5N1 (Li et al., 2004; Ge et al., 2013) . In animal husbandry, viral infection perhaps represents the greatest challenge that results in a massive or complete loss in fish and shellfish aquaculture (Walker and Winton, 2010) . Viral infection involves several major steps of viral entry, replication, assembly and release (Dimmock et al., 2007) . Understanding of these processes and underlying molecular mechanisms is necessary to develop antiviral drugs and approaches in human healthcare and animal production.More than 25 virus species have been described in diverse fish species of aquaculture importance, 9 of which are listed by the Office of International Epizootic as highly infectious and notifiable viruses (http://www.oie.int). The highly infectious Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) was first isolated in Singapore from the diseased brown spotted grouper (Epinephelus tauvina) as a novel member of genus Ranavirus in the family Iridoviridae (Qin et al., 2001) . In natural and farmed habitats, SGIV infection causes serious systemic diseases and massive death in wild and farmed groupers as well as many other marine teleosts (Qin et al., 2003) . In cell cultures, SGIV infection induces paraptosis in its natural host species but apoptosis in non-natural hosts Yuan et al., 2013) . The SGIV genome is a circular double-stranded DNA of 140,131 bp and predicts 162 protein-encoding genes or open reading frames (ORFs) (Song et al., 2004) . According to the timing of expression after entry into the host cells, SGIV genes fall into three major groups, which are immediate-early (IE), delay early (DE) and late groups (Williams et al., 2005; Teng et al., 2008) . Generally speaking, IE and DE genes are thought to encode regulatory proteins and key catalytic enzymes involved in cellular immune response, cell-cycle control and apoptosis, whereas late genes often code for viral structural proteins that participate in virion formation in a particular cellular compartment called the viral assembly site (VAS) (Chen et al., 2006; Xia et al., 2009) . In order to study the viral protein subcellular distribution, the SGIV IE genes of orf086 and orf162 (Xia et al., 2009; Xia et al., 2010) , DE gene orf136 (Huang et al., 2008) and late gene orf019 were overexpressed in host cells with fused EGFP tag respectively. It revealed that the forced expressed protein encoded by these IE and DE genes was distributed in the cytoplasm, but the protein encoded by the late gene condensed in the VAS at the late stage of SGIV infection. These distribution patterns were further verified with immunofluorescent staining, which demonstrated the reliability of using the ectopically expressed fusion protein to analyze the subcellular location of the viral protein.We make use of medaka (Oryzias latipes) as a model to study virus-host interactions in fish. Medaka is a laboratory fish and holds many genetic resources and toolboxes to study their functions in cellular processes and viral infection. This fish has many stem cell lines (Hong et al., 1996 (Hong et al., , 1998 Hong et al., 2004b; Yi et al., 2009) , which are susceptible to infection by aquaculture-important viruses such as the spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV), viral nervous necrosis virus (VNNV) and SGIV (Yuan et al., 2013) . More specifically, medaka has given rise to haploid embryonic stem (ES) cell lines that are capable of whole animal production by semicloning ) and susceptible to SVCV, VNNV and SGIV (Yuan et al., 2013) . Therefore, medaka represents a unique organism for haploid genetic screening for host factors that viruses use for infection in fish, as has recently been demonstrated for the identification of human genes essential for influenza A infection in a near-haploid cell line (Carette et al., 2009) . SGIV assembly in VAS is a key step in the viral infection cycle. The assembled viruses are subsequently matured and released as infectious pathogens. This study was aimed to identify a molecule that is suitable for visualizing dynamic processes of SGIV assembly and release in a living cell. The SGIV late gene encoded protein VP088 was identified as a putative myristylated envelope protein (Zhou et al., 2011) . We overexpressed this protein in host cells and show that the transgene expression of VP88GFP, a fusion between VP088 and green fluorescent protein (GFP), does not compromise the ES cell properties and susceptibility to SGIV. More importantly, VP88GFP shows the dynamic distribution in subcellular compartments. Specifically, the fusion protein disperses evenly in the cytoplasm and undergoes aggregation and redistribution after SGIV infection, which allows for real-time visualization of VAS dynamics in living cells. These results suggest that VP088 plays an important role in SGIV assembly and represents a suitable fusion partner for the production of GFP-tagged recombinant SGIV towards screening for drugs and host factors that control SGIV infection in medaka haploid ES cells.  Production of transgenic HX1 cells  The SGIV VP088 encoded by orf088 was chosen as a marker to visualize viral infection in cell culture. This protein is expressed late during SGIV infection in grouper cells and represents a putative SGIV envelope protein (Zhou et al., 2011) , which is conserved in several iridoviruses (Fig. S1 ). The gene of orf088 was inserted in frame ahead of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in pGFP, resulting in p88GFP (Fig. 1A) , which expresses VP88GFP, a fusion protein of 746 amino acid residues between VP088 and GFP (Fig. S2) .The medaka haploid ES cell line HX1 was chosen as a cellular model to study the SGIV infection process, because it offers a unique opportunity for genetic screening for molecular virus-host interactions and readily detectable cellular properties such as the ES cell phenotype, pluripotency expression and stable growth . The vectors of pGFP and p88GFP were separately transfected into HX1, producing stable transgenic clones of 88GFP-HX1 and GFP-HX1. On a Western blot analysis, GFP was detected as a band of about 27-kDa, and VP88GFP as a band of about 80-kDa (Fig. 1B) .  VP088 expression retains cellular properties  Upon transgenic expression in HX1 cells, VP88GFP was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C) , which is not different from GFP (Fig. 1D ). Expression of either VP88GFP or GFP did not alter the ES cell phenotype, since the transgenic cells displayed a round shape, little cytoplasm and prominent nuclei with large nucleoli (Fig. 1C '-E'), as has been reported for medaka diploid ES cell lines (Hong et al., 1996) and haploid ES cell lines including HX1 . Furthermore, stable growth of VP88GFP-expressing cells 88GFP-HX1 was similar to that of GFP-expressing cells GFP-HX1 (Fig. 1F ). Moreover, VP88GFP expression did not change pluripotency expression in HX1 cells, as the parental HX1 cells and their derivatives transgenic for VP88GFP and GFP all expressed pluripotency genes nanog and oct4, but not ntl, a differentiation marker (Fig. 1G ).  Dynamics of subcellular distribution of VP88GFP  As mentioned above, VP88GFP exhibited an even distribution in the cytoplasm, which became more evident at large magnification, where VP88GFP was found to be distributed almost evenly in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 2A) , and the virus inoculation procedure (at 0 hpi) did not alter the even distribution. After SGIV infection, VP88GFP altered subcellular distribution depending on intervals post infection. At 48 hpi, VP88GFP was highly condensed in the VAS, which resided close to the nucleus and was intensely stained by Hoechst 33342 due to the viral DNA ( Fig. 2B and 2C ). For comparison, GFP and mitochondria did not exhibit redistribution and localization ( Fig. 2A-C) . Taken together, VP88GFP shows uniform cytoplasmic distribution on its own and undergoes redistribution into the VAS in SGIVinfected HX1 cells.SGIV infection elicits cell death Yuan et al., 2013) . It has remained unknown when cell death occurs during SGIV infection. We examined this issue by using fluorescent nuclear dyes Hoechst 33342 and PI. Hoechst 33342 stains both live and dying/dead cells, while PI stains dying/dead cells only. HX1 cells shortly after SGIV infection were positive for Hoechst 33342 but negative for PI ( Fig. 3A ), suggesting they were living cells as expected. A similar staining was seen also in cells until 24 hpi with SGIV, when VP88GFP formed aggregates and the VAS became visible as a Hoechst 33342-stainable DNA-rich area near the nucleus (Fig. 3B ), implying cellular viability at this stage. Interestingly, VP088 remained predominantly in the cytoplasm when VAS was already visible, which demonstrates that VAS formation is independent on VP088. Apparently, the cells became positive for both Hoechst 33342 and PI at 36 hpi, when some VP88GFP aggregates were seen in the VAS (Fig. 3C ), indicating the onset of cell death detectable by this staining procedure. Staining with Hoechst 33342 and PI became more confined to the nucleus at 48 (Fig. 3D ) and 60 hpi (Fig. 3E ). By flow cytometry analyses, SGIV infection caused massive cell death in HX1 cells, with a minority of dead cells being necrotic (7.8%) and a majority being apoptotic (64.4%). Similar values were obtained in GFP-HX1 (8.3% and 66.1%) and 88GFP-HX1 cells (8.6% and 65.4%) (Fig. 4) , which indicates that the VP88GFP expression does not alter the cell death profile and pathways. Taken together, VP88GFP localizes into the VAS of SGIV-infected cells and the overexpressed VP88GFP does not change the cell death type of host.  Visualization of viral assembly  We wanted to analyze the subcellular redistribution of VP88GFP in SGIV-infected HX1 cells. To this, VP88GFP-expressing cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 for DNA in the nucleus and VAS, and they were continuously imaged for a period of 6 h starting at 48 hpi with SGIV. This revealed that VP88GFP became fully localized and highly condensed in the VAS within 6 h (Fig. 5 ). In the same time, the fully developed VAS disappeared as evidenced by a remarkable decrease in its viral DNA content and VP88GFP concentration ( Fig. 5H') . The dynamic process of VP88GFP redistribution is more evident in a time-lapse movie (Movie S1A and B). Taken together, VP88GFP shows biphasic redistribution relative to VAS formation and subsequent viral release from VAS, as summarized in schematic diagrams (Fig. 6) . Therefore, VP88GFP offers a marker to visualize the redistribution and recruitment of macromolecular components for SGIV assembly and SGIV release.  DISCUSSION  VAS also known as the "viral factory" is a dynamic cellular structure that forms late during the viral infection cycle and functions in key process of viral replication and/or assembly, and thus represents a target for intervention of viral infection (Novoa et al., 2005; Williams et al., 2005) . The VAS of SGIV is a unique subcellular component containing DNA and protein for virus assembly. This DNA gathering point locates at the perinuclear region of the host cell, which can be recognized with DNA staining (Xia et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2013 Visualizing Singapore grouper iridovirus assembly  RESEARCH ARTICLE  a consequence of virion releasing, which establishes, for the first time to our knowledge, a 12-h process for VAS formation and SGIV release in a host cell. Macromolecular assembly into complexes and cellular structures operates widely in the living system, ranging from viruses to higher eukaryotic organisms including plants and animals. The mechanisms underlying macromolecular assembly in normal and abnormal processes have attracted considerable attention. In this regard, VAS represents an excellent system to elucidate macromolecular assembly, because many, if not all macromolecular components for the VAS formation and ultimate assembly into virions within VAS are of viral origin and thus exogenous to host cells for clear identification. In this study, GFP-tagged VP088 serves an excellent marker for VAS visualization. Prior to SGIV infection, we revealed that GFP-tagged VP088 on itself is a cytoplasmic protein as intracellular expressed VP88GFP distributes evenly in the cytoplasm of a host cell. However, in SGIV-challenged cells, we have demonstrated that VAS formation is initiated before the condensation of VP088. Redistribution of VP88GFP is triggered by viral invasion and exhibits a distinct pattern by condensing in VAS, which is similar to the VAS related distribution of SGIV envelope protein VP19 , providing direct evidence that this protein is not required for VAS formation. On the contrary, reports indicated the distribution of non-structural proteins encoded by orf086 or orf162 has no colocalization with the VAS of SGIV (Xia et al., 2009; Xia et al., 2010) . These observations suggest that VP088 is indeed a structural protein of SGIV particles and this notion is also supported by a previous report that the VP088 has three putative transmembrane domains and located as a viral envelope protein (Zhou et al., 2011) . A closer inspection leads to a striking finding, which is the redistribution and sequential component recruitment for SGIV assembly in a host cell.After condensation in the VAS, VP88GFP becomes hardly detectable by fluorescence. This allows for two alternative explanations. One is its degradation after its involvement in maturation. The other is VAS disassembly due to the release of matured virions as its content. We prefer to the second possibility because the disappearance of VP88GFP from VAS accompanies the disappearance of viral DNA and the appearance of the VP88GFP signal in cytoplasmic areas other than VAS. This is also in accordance with VP088 as an envelope protein (Zhou et al., 2011) .Visualization of VP88GFP in this study reveals the dynamic processes of VAS formation and disassembly, which may be described in eight representative stages (Fig. 6) . VP88GFP disperses evenly in the cytoplasm, and the SGIV infection procedure does not alter this distribution pattern (Fig. 6A) . Upon SGIV infection, VAS formation occurs in the absence of VP88GFP, when VP88GFP undergoes aggregation (Fig. 6B) . During subsequent infection, this protein is first seen in the VAS (Fig. 6C) , which demarcates the onset of its entry into VAS and suggests sequential recruitment of VP88GFP for SGIV assembly. Meanwhile, the dead cell can be detected by PI staining. When the infection proceeds, VP88GFP becomes concentrated (Fig. 6D) and condensed in the VAS (Fig. 6E) . VP88GFP starts to appear outside the VAS (Fig. 6F) , suggesting VAS disassembly and virion release into the nearby cytoplasm. Ultimately, VP88GFP-containing SGIV virus particles spread throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 6G ) and finally release out of the cell membrane (Fig. 6H) , completing the infectious cycle. The host cells become dead by apoptosis and necrosis as evidenced by PI staining and nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 6D-H) . Viral infection brings about two major events, namely virus propagation and host cell response. SGIV causes host cell death by two pathways: One is non-apoptotic programmed cell death (PCD) as has been reported in its natural host species , the other is apoptosis as has been reported in non-natural host species and medaka HX1 cells in culture Yuan et al., 2013) . In this study, we have observed that SGIV induces not only apoptosis as a major death pathway but also necrosis at a detectable level.More importantly, one interesting observation is that the distribution of ectopic expressed VP88GFP changed after virus infection by aggregation and condensation into the VAS. However, our results here do not reveal the distribution process of viral genome itself encoded VP088 throughout the infection cycle. The gene encoding VP88GFP is inserted into the host genome together with a CMV promoter, but the VP088 is encoded by the genome of the infected virus. The gene copy numbers of them are different, and the expression of each protein is driven by a different promoter. Additionally, the timing of protein expression varied from each other. The VP88GFP is expressed before the virus infection, but the expression of VP088 is activated only after virus infection. Considering the above concerns, generation of a recombinant SGIV containing a GFP-tagged VP088 will resolve this issue in the future. Successful visualization of VAS dynamics with fluorescent protein tagged virus has been reported (Heath et al., 2001) . Future work is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying programmed aggregation and cell death commencement as well as the mechanism underlying SGIV infection-dependent redistribution of VP088 and the precise role that VP088 plays in SGIV assembly and release. The recently published study has illustrated the assembly and budding of SGIV with electron miscopy (Liu et al., 2016) and the details of how SGIV entry into host cells by labeling the SGIV particles with chemical dye (Wang et al., 2014) . In summary, VP088 is not cytotoxic and does not compromise the ES cell property, viral susceptibility and hostvirus interactions. This protein undergoes SGIV-dependent subcellular redistribution and shows sequential recruitment into the VAS for viral assembly. These features make VP88GFP an excellent marker for generating GFP-tagged recombinant SGIV for the experimental analysis and realtime visualization of SGIV infection.  Fish  Work with fish followed the guidelines on the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes of the National Advisory Committee for Laboratory Animal Research in Singapore and approved by this committee (permit number 27/09). Medaka was maintained under an artificial photoperiod of 14-h/10-h light/darkness at 26°C as described (Li et al., 2009; Hong et al., 2010) .  Plasmids  Plasmid p88GFP that encodes the fusion protein VP88GFP between VP088 and GFP was constructed by three-component ligation. Briefly, the orf088 coding sequence (CDS) was amplified by using primers orf088Eco (aagaattcaccATGGGCGCAGCGC) plus orf088-Hind (gcaagcttCTTTGCAGCTTC) from SGIV, and the gfp CDS was PCR-amplified by using primers GFPHind (gcaagcttGTGAG-CAAGGGCGAG) plus GFPXho (gactcgagTCACTTGTACAGCTCG) from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). The PCR products were digested with EcoRI plus HindIII (orf088 fragment) or HindIII plus XhoI (gfp fragment) and combined with EcoRI-XhoI double-digested pcDNA3.1 for ligation. Control plasmid pGFP was generated with an insertion gene of gfp between restriction sites of EcoRI and XhoI in pcDAN3.1. Correct constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Plasmid DNA was prepared with a Midiprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).  Cell culture and transfection  The medaka haploid ES cell line HX1 was maintained at 28°C in the medium of ESM4 as previously described (Hong and Schartl, 2006; Yi et al., 2010) . The grouper spleen cell line GS was maintained at 25°C in L15-medium (Leibovitz) containing 10% fetal bovine serum . Cell transfection was performed by using DNAfectin reagent (Applied Biological Materials, Richmond, BC, Canada) essentially as described (Hong et al., 2004a) . Briefly, 2 µg of plasmid DNA (p88GFP or pGFP) and 8 µL of DNAfectin reagent were mixed in 200 µL of pure DMEM. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the transfection mixture was added dropwise to cells in a 6-well plate containing 2 mL of DMEM. After incubation for 6 h at 28°C, the cells were grown in ESM4 for 48 h and subcultured in 10-cm dishes for clonal growth in the presence of 0.5 mg/mL of G418 (Hong et al., 1996) . The medium was changed every 5-7 days. Single colonies comprising GFP-positive cells were picked with 200-µL tips into 96-well plates and serially expanded into 88GFP-HX1 cells (p88GFP transfectants) and GFP-HX1 cells (pGFP transfectants) as described (Hong et al., 1996) .  Virus preparation and inoculation  SGIV (strain A3/12/98) originally isolated from the diseased brownspotted grouper (E. tauvina) was propagated in GS cells as described (Qin et al., 2003) . Briefly, SGIV was inoculated onto confluent GS cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of ∼0.1. Upon the appearance of apparent cytopathic effect, cells were harvested and centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 10 min at 4°C, the cell debris together with partial supernatant were collected and stored at −80°C until use. HX1 cells were infected similarly.  RT-PCR analysis  RNA isolation from cell culture and RT-PCR analyses were performed as described (Hong et al., 2004b; Yuan et al., 2013) . PCR was run in a 20-µL volume containing 10 ng of cDNA reaction for 25 (β-actin as a loading control) and 35 cycles (95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 20 s and 72°C for 1 min; other genes). PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels. Primers used are listed in Table S1 .  Cell growth assay  Cell growth was analyzed as described (Hong et al., 1996; Yi et al., 2009 ). Briefly, 10 5 of 88GFP-HX1 and GFP-HX1 cells were seeded into the 6-well plate and counted in triplicates every 24 h until 8 days of culture.  Cell staining  Growing cells in culture were co-stained with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide (PI) before fluorescent microscopic observation. In detail, the culture medium containing Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/mL) plus PI (1 μg/mL) were added carefully into the culture containing virusinfected cells and incubated at 28°C for 10 min. To reduce the fluorescence background, the cells were carefully rinsed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and refed with fresh medium. Nuclear staining in living cells (Hoechst 33342) and dying/dead cells (PI) was visualized by fluorescent microscopy.Flow cytometric assay HX1, GFP-HX1 and 88GFP-HX1 cells at 48 hpi with SGIV (MOI of 0.1) were trypsinized into single cell suspension and 10 5 cells were stained with 5 μL of Annexin V/pacific blue (Invitrogen, USA) in 100 μL of binding buffer for 15 min at room temperature and counterstained with PI at 50 μg/mL. SGIV infected cells and mock control cells were analyzed on the BD LSR Fortessa (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA).  Microscopy  Observation and photography on Zeiss Axiovert invert microscope with a Zeiss AxioCam M5Rc digital camera (Zeiss Corp., Germany) were done as described Yuan et al., 2014) . Confocal microscopic observation and time-lapse imaging were performed on the UltraView VoX (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) using an Olympus water-immersion 40× objective lens (NA = 1.15; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) by using software Volocity 6.2.1 (PerkinElmer) setting for sequential record modes at 3 channels of laser lines at 405, 488 and 561 nm.  Statistical analysis  The Dunnett's test was conducted by using GraphPad Prism v4.0. Data are presented as means ± S.D, and P < 0.05 were calculated by using Student's t-test and considered as significant differences as described .  					1			
27783669	Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus Accessory Protein 4a Inhibits PKR-Mediated Antiviral Stress Responses	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5081173/	Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe respiratory infections that can be life-threatening. To establish an infection and spread, MERS-CoV, like most other viruses, must navigate through an intricate network of antiviral host responses. Besides the well-known type I interferon (IFN-α/β) response, the protein kinase R (PKR)-mediated stress response is being recognized as an important innate response pathway. Upon detecting viral dsRNA, PKR phosphorylates eIF2α, leading to the inhibition of cellular and viral translation and the formation of stress granules (SGs), which are increasingly recognized as platforms for antiviral signaling pathways. It is unknown whether cellular infection by MERS-CoV activates the stress response pathway or whether the virus has evolved strategies to suppress this infection-limiting pathway. Here, we show that cellular infection with MERS-CoV does not lead to the formation of SGs. By transiently expressing the MERS-CoV accessory proteins individually, we identified a role of protein 4a (p4a) in preventing activation of the stress response pathway. Expression of MERS-CoV p4a impeded dsRNA-mediated PKR activation, thereby rescuing translation inhibition and preventing SG formation. In contrast, p4a failed to suppress stress response pathway activation that is independent of PKR and dsRNA. MERS-CoV p4a is a dsRNA binding protein. Mutation of the dsRNA binding motif in p4a disrupted its PKR antagonistic activity. By inserting p4a in a picornavirus lacking its natural PKR antagonist, we showed that p4a exerts PKR antagonistic activity also under infection conditions. However, a recombinant MERS-CoV deficient in p4a expression still suppressed SG formation, indicating the expression of at least one other stress response antagonist. This virus also suppressed the dsRNA-independent stress response pathway. Thus, MERS-CoV interferes with antiviral stress responses using at least two different mechanisms, with p4a suppressing the PKR-dependent stress response pathway, probably by sequestering dsRNA. MERS-CoV p4a represents the first coronavirus stress response antagonist described.

It is unknown whether cellular infection by MERS-CoV activates the stress response pathway or whether the virus has evolved strategies to suppress this infection-limiting pathway. Here, we show that cellular infection with MERS-CoV does not lead to the formation of SGs. By transiently expressing the MERS-CoV accessory proteins individually, we identified a role of protein 4a (p4a) in preventing activation of the stress response pathway. Expression of MERS-CoV p4a impeded dsRNA-mediated PKR activation, thereby rescuing translation inhibition and preventing SG formation. In contrast, p4a failed to suppress stress response pathway activation that is independent of PKR and dsRNA. MERS-CoV p4a is a dsRNA binding protein.Mutation of the dsRNA binding motif in p4a disrupted its PKR antagonistic activity. By inserting p4a in a picornavirus lacking its natural PKR antagonist, we showed that p4a exerts PKR antagonistic activity also under infection conditions. However, a recombinant MERS-CoV deficient in p4a expression still suppressed SG formation, indicating the expression of at least one other stress response antagonist. This virus also suppressed the dsRNA-independent stress response pathway. Thus, MERS-CoV interferes with antiviral stress responses using at least two different mechanisms, with p4a suppressing the PKR-  Introduction  Innate antiviral responses represent the first line of defense against invading viral pathogens. Host cells are equipped with multiple mechanisms to detect and respond to non-self, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). One of these PAMPs, viral cytosolic RNA, can be detected by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), such as melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and retinoic acid inducible gene 1 (RIG-I). Upon recognition of viral, non-self RNA, signal transduction pathways are activated, which results in the expression of type I interferons (IFN-α/β), proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Secreted IFN-α/β triggers the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), both in infected as neighboring cells, and thereby implements an antiviral state that restricts virus propagation in the host.Growing evidence points to an important role of the stress response pathway as an additional innate antiviral response [1, 2] . One of the ISGs, protein kinase R (PKR), detects viral RNA in the cytoplasm, which induces its autophosphorylation and subsequent phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). PKR mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α inactivates (viral) protein synthesis, thereby affecting virus propagation. Stalled translation initiation complexes, together with nucleating factors like G3BP1, G3BP2, TIA-1 and many translation initiation factors like eIF3, form cytoplasmic aggregates, which are called stress granules (SGs). The role of these SGs remains controversial, but growing evidence points to a role of these SGs as a platform for antiviral signal transduction [3] [4] [5] .To ensure efficient virus replication, many viruses encode proteins with specialized functions to evade innate antiviral responses, although their mode of action and the point of interference may differ. Viruses usually interfere in several antiviral pathways and even disrupt pathways at multiple levels, to ensure efficient suppression of the host innate antiviral responses. A well-studied example is the Influenza A virus NS1 protein, which, among many other evasive functions, shields viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from detection by both RLRs and PKR [6, 7] , thus blocking IFN-α/β and antiviral stress response pathways, respectively.Coronaviruses are large positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the order Nidovirales. The coronavirus genome is typically between 26 and 32 kb in size and encodes more than 20 proteins. The 5' open reading frame (ORF)1ab encodes the non-structural proteins (nsps), which together form the replication-transcription machinery. The 3' end of the coronavirus genome contains several additional ORFs encoding the structural proteins and a varying number of accessory proteins. These accessory proteins often lack any detectable homology to other viral or host proteins and their function is unknown in many cases. A common feature, however, is that they are often not essential for virus replication per se but are important for virulence, suggesting that accessory proteins serve to modulate host antiviral responses [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .Human coronaviruses generally cause mild respiratory symptoms. Exceptions are severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in China in 2002 through cross-species transmissions from bats and civet cats [14] , and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which emerged in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012. MERS-CoV causes acute and severe respiratory symptoms and continues to make a serious impact on the local as well as the global health system with over 1,694 laboratory confirmed cases and 605 deaths as of March 21 st 2016 [15] . This virus is believed to be transmitted to humans primarily via animal hosts, most likely dromedary camels [16, 17] . As yet, little is known about how MERS-CoV modulates host antiviral responses. There is firm evidence that MERS-CoV inhibits IFN-α/β production [18] [19] [20] and several viral proteins have been implicated in this evasion mechanism-including accessory protein 4a (p4a), which is a dsRNA-binding protein [21] [22] [23] -but the inhibitory effect of these proteins on innate antiviral responses has thus far only been demonstrated in transfected cells expressing these viral proteins, not during virus infection. Whether MERS-CoV has also evolved mechanisms to modulate the stress response pathway is unknown thus far.Here, we show for the first time that MERS-CoV actively suppresses the stress response pathway and we identify the accessory protein 4a as a potent inhibitor of the PKR-mediated stress response pathway. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the rescue of translation and inhibition of SG formation rely on p4a's dsRNA-binding function, suggesting that it exerts antagonistic activity by sequestering dsRNA from recognition by PKR. Moreover, evidence for the existence of at least one other MERS-CoV encoded stress response antagonist is provided.  MERS-CoV blocks stress responses in infected cells  To investigate whether MERS-CoV infection activates the stress response pathway, Vero cells were infected with MERS-CoV (MOI = 1) and analyzed for the occurrence of SG at regular time intervals by visualizing the subcellular localization of eIF3 and G3BP2, which are established markers for SGs. In parallel, the efficiency of virus infection was monitored by visualizing dsRNA using the J2 antibody. Despite efficient virus infection and replication, as indicated by the accumulation of considerable amounts of viral dsRNA in the cytosol, no SGs were observed at any of the indicated time points (Fig 1A) . The lack of SGs was not due to an intrinsic defect in the stress response pathway of Vero cells as clear SGs were formed upon arsenic acid treatment and poly(I:C) transfection ( Fig 1B) . Together, these findings indicate that MERS-CoV either hides its viral RNA from detection by PKR, possibly through the formation of double membrane vesicles [24] , and/or that it encodes one or more antagonists to suppress activation of the stress response pathway.  MERS-CoV p4a suppresses dsRNA-and PKR-dependent formation of SGs  To investigate whether MERS-CoV accessory proteins can suppress the stress response pathway, we expressed them individually as EGFP fusion proteins and monitored SG formation in transfected cells. This approach is based on the observation that transfection of plasmid DNA, and in particular the pEGFP plasmids, can activate PKR, most likely due to the production of dsRNA formed from positive and negative sense mRNA transcription from cryptic promoters in these plasmids [25] . Indeed, we observed that transfection of pEGFP plasmid DNA in HeLa cells triggered SG formation in a PKR-dependent manner, as no SGs were observed in PKR knockout cells (HeLa-PKR KO ), which we generated using the CRISPR-Cas9 system (S1 Fig) (Fig 2A and 2B) . Also, using the J2 anti-dsRNA antibody, we noticed a significant increase in dsRNA levels in cells transfected with pEGFP plasmid DNA and especially in cells that displayed SGs (Fig 2C and 2D ). This phenomenon was not restricted to the pEGFP plasmid as all plasmids with eukaryotic promoters induced SG formation in our HeLa cells, albeit to different levels, while those with prokaryotic promoters did not (S2 Fig) . Together, these data support the idea that transfection of pEGFP plasmid DNA can trigger dsRNA-dependent and PKRmediated SG formation, and provide the basis for a convenient and versatile method to test potential antagonistic activities of viral proteins by expressing them as EGFP fusion proteins.Plasmids each encoding one of the four MERS-CoV accessory proteins fused to EGFP were transfected into HeLa cells. As a positive control, we took along an EGFP fusion of the influenza A virus (IAV) NS1 protein, which is an established PKR antagonist. As shown in Fig 2E, plasmid DNA transfection induced SG formation except for the plasmids encoding the MERS-CoV p4a and IAV NS1 EGFP fusion proteins. The absence of SG formation (Fig 2E and  2F ) coincided with a lack of PKR phosphorylation ( Fig 2G) . We also tested the ability of these MERS-CoV accessory proteins to suppress the stress response pathway induced by the more commonly applied method of poly(I:C) transfection. Again, we observed that p4a, but none of the other MERS-CoV accessory proteins, suppressed SG formation (S3 Fig) . The inhibitory effect of p4a, as well as that of NS1, was less pronounced in this assay, possibly because the relatively large amounts of poly(I:C) may exceed the maximum capacity of the PKR antagonists. Taken together, our data suggests that MERS-CoV p4a is a PKR antagonist and inhibits the stress response pathway at the level of, or upstream of, PKR phosphorylation.  MERS-CoV p4a suppresses PKR-mediated translation inhibition  We observed that the protein levels of p4a and NS1 were higher than those of the other MERS-CoV accessory proteins ( Fig 2E) . We reasoned that the inhibition of plasmid DNA-induced PKR activation may increase protein translation levels. Indeed, co-expression of p4a or NS1 together with Renilla luciferase (RLuc) caused a reproducible 5-to 10-fold increase in luciferase counts compared to the EGFP control plasmid (Fig 3A) . This effect was attributed to increased translation, since p4a expression had no effect on RLuc mRNA levels. In addition, RLuc counts were not increased in PKR KO results were obtained upon co-expression with an RFP expression plasmid ( Fig 3B) . These data are in line with the observation that MERS-CoV p4a antagonizes PKR activity, and provide another indication that viral PKR antagonists can rescue translation efficiency in cells in which the stress pathway is activated by (viral) dsRNA.  MERS-CoV p4a fails to inhibit PKR-independent stress pathway activation  Both MERS-CoV p4a and IAV NS1 are dsRNA binding proteins [6, 21] , which suggests that p4a shields the viral dsRNA from detection by PKR. To test whether p4a can also inhibit stress pathway activation via PKR-and dsRNA-independent mechanisms, we used arsenic acid and heat shock to induce eIF2α-dependent stress pathway activation [28] . Furthermore, we used pateamine A to induce SG formation via an eIF2α-independent mechanism [29]. In agreement with earlier findings, IAV NS1 failed to inhibit PKR-independent SG formation [30]. A small Immune fluorescence images of HeLa-wt or HeLa-PKR KO cells transfected with pEGFP-N3 plasmid (500 ng/well). Cells were fixed at 24h post transfection using paraformaldehyde and stained for G3BP1 (shown in red). EGFP expression is shown in green. (B) Quantification of SG-positive cells. SG-positive cells were quantified from three randomly selected images. Shown are means with standard deviations, analyzed using an unpaired t-test (***, p<0.001). (C) Quantification of the average dsRNA staining intensity in individual cells using imageJ software. Intensity levels are plotted relative to that of the non-transfected cells from the same images. Cells were classified as non-transfected or transfected based on EGFP expression, and as SG-positive or SGnegative based on presence of G3BP1 aggregates. Differences in relative dsRNA intensity levels were analyzed using an unpaired t-test (**, p<0.01). reduction in PKR-independent SG formation was observed in cells overexpressing p4a (Fig 4A  and 4B ). However, lack of SGs was only observed in cells expressing very high levels of p4a, whereas a moderate expression level of p4a was already sufficient to inhibit PKR-mediated SG formation ( Fig 2E) . To rule out any involvement of PKR expression in the small reduction of PKR-independent SG formation, we tested arsenic acid, heat shock and pateamine A-induced stress pathway activation in HeLa-PKR KO cells. Also under these conditions, expression of p4a affected SG formation only in a small fraction of the cells (Fig 4C and 4D ). Thus, MERS-CoV p4a seems to predominantly suppress dsRNA-dependent PKR activation and does not efficiently target other parts of the stress response pathway.  MERS-CoV p4a can functionally replace the PKR antagonist of a picornavirus  Studying immune evasion functions of viral proteins by transient overexpression from plasmid DNA may suffer from shortcomings. Transfection procedures fail to mimic the dynamic interplay between dsRNA and the antagonist, both of which gradually appear over time during the viral life cycle. Furthermore, transfection may yield non-physiologically high levels of viral proteins and/or dsRNA mimics which may blur results. Also, dsRNA-mimicking molecules, like poly(I:C), may be delivered to compartments where viral dsRNA does not naturally localize under infection conditions. Therefore, we set out to investigate the function of p4a as an innate antiviral response antagonist under infection conditions. For this, we made use of a recombinant encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV, strain mengovirus). EMCV is a member of the picornavirus family that, like coronaviruses, produces dsRNA replication intermediates during its life cycle. In the recombinant EMCV, the function of the leader (L) protein-which antagonizes the dsRNA-triggered IFN-α/β and stress response pathways-is disturbed by specific mutations in an essential zincfinger motif (EMCV-L-Zn) [31,32]. By consequence, and in contrast to wt virus, EMCV-L-Zn causes strong activation of the IFN-α/β and stress response pathways [31, 32] .To study whether heterologous expression of p4a can prevent PKR activation, recombinant viruses were generated expressing Strep2-tagged MERS-CoV p4a or IAV NS1 (as a control) upstream of the inactivated L ( Fig 5A) . EMCV wt infection did not induce SG formation while EMCV-L-Zn induced SGs in~80% of the cells. Infection of cells with recombinant EMCV-L-Zn expressing p4a or NS1 protein resulted in SG formation in <20% of the cells (Fig 5B and  5C ). This reduction was not due to differences in infection efficiency, since Strep2-tagged proteins were detected in the majority of cells ( Fig 4B) . In fact, SGs were only observed in cells displaying low expression levels of p4a or IAV NS1.Western blot analysis was performed to assess the level of PKR phosphorylation. Total PKR levels were significantly reduced in EMCV-infected cells, a phenomenon that was described earlier by Dubois et al. [33] , although the mechanism behind this remains unclear. Yet, even with these reduced PKR levels, EMCV-L-Zn infection induced strong PKR phosphorylation, which was reversed by the expression of p4a or NS1 (Fig 5D) . Analysis of viral protein levels using an antibody directed against the viral capsid indicated that viral protein levels were higher in cells infected with p4a-and NS1-expressing viruses compared to EMCV-L-Zn infected cells, indicating that expression of these PKR antagonists increased virus replication efficiency. Taken together, these results indicate that MERS-CoV p4a can functionally replace the PKR antagonist of a picornavirus in infected cells.The MERS-CoV p4a dsRNA-binding domain is crucial for its function MERS-CoV p4a contains a dsRNA-binding motif similar to those found in some cellular proteins ( S5 Fig). Previously, a p4a mutant containing substitutions in its dsRNA-binding motif (K 63 A/K 67 A) was shown to be deficient in binding dsRNA [22] . Based on the sequence similarity of this dsRNA-binding motif to those in Staufen, ADAR1, ADAR2 and PKR, and the published NMR structure of the ADAR2 dsRNA-binding domain in complex with its ligand [34], we designed a second mutant containing a single substitution (Q 9 P) in another part of the conserved dsRNA-binding motif (S5 Fig). Infection of HeLa cells with recombinant EMCV-L-Zn viruses expressing either of these p4a mutants resulted in efficient SG formation, indicating a complete loss of the stress-antagonizing function (Fig 6A and 6B ). In agreement herewith, analysis of the PKR phosphorylation status demonstrated that the p4a mutants failed to inhibit PKR phosphorylation (Fig 6C) . Consistently, viruses expressing these mutants showed reduced capsid protein expression, possibly as a consequence of PKR-mediated translation inhibition. Thus, the dsRNA-binding motif in MERS-CoV p4a is essential for its function to antagonize PKR-mediated SG formation and translation shut-off.   Expression of MERS-CoV p4a also suppresses IFN-α/β pathway activation under infection conditions  Previous studies have shown that expression of p4a is able to reduce the level of IFN-α/β pathway activation in transiently transfected cells [21] [22] [23] . Consistently, we observed that transient expression of p4a inhibited poly(I:C)-induced ( Fig 7A) and dsRNA-induced ( Fig 7B) IFNβ mRNA transcription. To assess whether p4a can also inhibit the IFN-α/β pathway in virus-infected cells, we compared IFNβ mRNA transcription levels in cells infected with recombinant EMCV-L-Zn viruses expressing either p4a or NS1. Both p4a and IAV NS1 significantly suppressed transcription of IFNβ mRNA (Fig 7C) . This ability was lost in viruses expressing mutant p4a proteins that are unable to bind dsRNA (Fig 7) . These data show that MERS-CoV p4a also inhibits the IFN-α/β response in EMCV-L-Zn-infected cells and that this function also requires its dsRNA-binding activity.  MERS-CoV p4a increases EMCV-L-Zn replication efficiency  Our data show that p4a is a multi-functional protein that antagonizes both the stress response and the IFN-α/β response pathways. To demonstrate the functional and beneficial role of p4amediated antagonism of the stress response pathway, we set out to compare the replication efficiency of recombinant viruses in HeLa-wt cells and cells that are defective in the PKR-induced stress response pathway (HeLa-PKR KO cells). Infection of HeLa-PKR KO cells with EMCV-L-Zn showed that these cells are unable to mount a stress response (Fig 8A) , whereas IFN-α/β pathway activation was only slightly affected in these cells (Fig 8B) , indicating that possible differences in virus fitness can be predominantly attributed to the defective stress response pathway. Replication of EMCV-L-Zn under low MOI infection conditions is severely impaired in HeLa-wt cells, whereas replication was fully rescued to the level of EMCV wt in HeLa-PKR KO cells (Fig 8C) . Comparison of the replication efficiency of recombinant viruses expressing p4a or the p4a mutant containing the K 63 A/K 67 A substitutions showed that the antagonistic activity of p4a provided a clear fitness advantage in HeLa-wt cells (Fig 8C) . The observation that the p4a-expressing virus failed to replicate to similar titers as wt virus is unlikely due to inefficient PKR inhibition by p4a as comparable titers were obtained for the recombinant viruses expressing p4a or mutant p4a in HeLa-PKR KO cells. Notwithstanding the lower virus titer, which may either be due to imperfect polyprotein processing due to introduction of p4a or to less efficient encapsidation of the larger viral genome, these results provide evidence that the PKR antagonistic function of MERS-CoV p4a can provide a virus fitness advantage in PKR-competent cells.Similar results were obtained in virus competition experiments (Fig 8D) , which is a more sensitive method to compare virus fitness and can reveal smaller fitness differences. Upon low MOI infection, EMCV-L-Zn expressing p4a rapidly outgrew EMCV-L-Zn in HeLa-wt cells but not in HeLa-PKR KO cells (Fig 8E) . No fitness advantage was observed with virus expressing the mutant p4a (Fig 8F) . We also co-infected cells with viruses expressing either p4a or mutant p4a. Since these viruses could not be distinguished based on their amplicon length, we used a HindIII restriction reaction to specifically cleave the wt 4a PCR fragment (the HindIII site is absent in the mutant 4a gene). Consistent with the results of the multi-cycle infection experiment shown in Fig  8C, the virus expressing p4a replicated better than the virus expressing mutant p4a in HeLa-wt cells whereas in PKR KO cells only a minor advantage was observed (Fig 8G) .  MERS-CoV encodes at least one other suppressor of the stress response pathway  Thus far, we used a recombinant picornavirus, EMCV, to analyze the function of p4a in virusinfected cells, in the absence of other MERS-CoV proteins. To assess the relevance of p4a for stress response antagonism in MERS-CoV infected cells, we used recombinant MERS-CoV-ΔORF4 that is deficient in p4a and p4b expression. Surprisingly, like wt MERS-CoV, MERS-CoVΔORF4 did not induce SG formation in Vero cells (Fig 9A) , suggesting that MERS-CoV expresses at least one other protein that suppresses the stress response pathway. To gain more insight into the working mechanism of this other stress response pathway antagonist, we treated MERS-CoV infected cells with arsenite. As demonstrated in Fig 9B, this treatment resulted in SG formation in all the uninfected cells, whereas no SGs were detected in cells infected with either MERS-CoV or MERS-CoVΔORF4 (Fig 9B) . These findings strongly suggest that MERS-CoV encodes at least one other stress response antagonist with a mode of action that differs from that of p4a. We also tested the IFN-α/β pathway activation in cells infected with the mutant virus. In line with the reports that several MERS-CoV proteins can antagonize the IFN-α/β pathway [21, 23, [35] [36] [37] [38] , no increase in IFNβ mRNA levels was observed in Huh7 cells infected with MERS-CoV or MERS-CoVΔORF4 (Fig 9C) . Taken together, these data provide evidence for substantial redundancy with respect to antagonism of innate antiviral responses in MERS-CoV infected cells.  Discussion  Most viruses have evolved mechanisms to antagonize innate antiviral responses. Coronaviruses encode a set of genus-specific, or in some cases even species-specific, proteins that are generally dispensable for replication in vitro but ensure efficient virus replication and/or spreading in vivo [10, 11, [39] [40] [41] . Some of these so-called accessory proteins have been shown to antagonize specific innate antiviral responses, but the functions of most of them are still unknown [9, 10, 23, [42] [43] [44] . Thus far, most studies concentrated on IFN-α/β pathway antagonists, whereas inhibition of the cellular stress response pathway by coronaviruses remains largely unexplored. In this study, we focused on the recently identified MERS-CoV, and showed that infected cells fail to activate the stress response pathway. In our subsequent search for MERS-CoV-encoded stress response antagonists, each of its accessory proteins was tested individually for the ability to suppress this pathway. Transient expression of p4a specifically suppressed dsRNA-mediated and PKR-dependent translation inhibition and SG formation. Moreover, we showed that p4a can functionally substitute for the PKR antagonist of EMCV in infected cells. Introduction of specific mutations revealed that the ability of p4a to suppress activation of the stress response pathway depends on its dsRNA-binding function. Together, the data strongly suggest that p4a suppresses the PKR-mediated stress response pathway by sequestering viral dsRNA. Yet, infection of cells with a recombinant MERS-CoV deficient in p4a expression failed to trigger SG formation. This finding points to the expression of at least one other stress response antagonist by MERS-CoV. Importantly, this other suppressor(s) differs in its mode of action of p4a, since in contrast to p4a, it was able to suppress activation of the arsenite-induced stress pathway. Together, these data suggest that MERS-CoV has evolved redundant mechanisms to suppress the stress response pathway at multiple levels.To our knowledge, MERS-CoV p4a is the first coronavirus protein identified as an antagonist of the dsRNA-dependent, PKR-mediated stress response. There are strong indications that other coronaviruses also encode stress response antagonists but their identity and mode of action remain to be determined. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, a γ-CoV) interferes with phosphorylation of both PKR and eIF2α through an unknown mechanism(s) [45] . Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) triggers SG formation, but causes a reduction in the amount of phosphorylated eIF2α over time, possibly by recruiting eIF2α phosphatase PP1 through accessory protein 7 [46, 47] . Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, a lineage A β-CoV) triggers eIF2α phosphorylation and SG formation relatively late in infection, suggesting that the virus actively delays the stress response pathway [48] [49] [50] , but the mechanism is unknown. SARS-CoV (a lineage B β-CoV) has been reported to trigger PKR activation but to be resistant to its antiviral activity [51] , although in another study a strong antiviral effect of PKR was observed [52] . Hence, the limited information that is available suggests that coronaviruses have acquired different strategies to antagonize the stress response pathway. Importantly, none of these coronaviruses encode a protein with any homology to MERS-CoV p4a.In this study, we assessed p4a's antagonistic activities not only upon transient overexpression, but also in the context of viral infection. For this, we introduced p4a in a recombinant EMCV (EMCV-L-Zn) in which the IFN-α/β and stress response pathway antagonist-the leader (L) protein-was inactivated. A p4a-expressing recombinant EMCV may provide several advantages over overexpression through transient transfection, as it likely better mimics the dynamic production of-as well as the interplay between-dsRNA and the viral antagonist. Using this approach, we showed that dsRNA sequestration by p4a efficiently suppresses the PKR-dependent stress response pathway as well as MDA5-mediated IFN-α/β responses under these infection conditions, and thereby provides a fitness advantage to this recombinant EMCV. Similar results were obtained with a recombinant virus expressing IAV NS1, which was included as a control. Together, these data suggests that p4a can be categorized in the group of previously identified viral dsRNA-binding antagonists of stress response and IFN-α/β pathways, which besides IAV NS1, also includes Ebola virus VP35 and Vaccinia virus E3L [26, 27] .Our results showed that besides p4a, MERS-CoV expresses at least one other stress response antagonist. This other antagonist(s) is likely one of the nsps or a structural protein, as we excluded stress-antagonizing roles of the other accessory proteins. At least one antagonist can also suppress the arsenite-induced stress response pathway, and is therefore unlikely to act directly at the level of PKR. Instead, it may act at the level of eIF2α phosphorylation or SG formation. Identification of the other stress response antagonist(s) and elucidation of its/their mode of action, awaits further investigation.Functional redundancy in suppressing innate antiviral responses is a well-documented phenomenon for coronaviruses. The MERS-CoV accessory proteins (p4a, p4b, and p5) [21] [22] [23] 36] as well as the structural M protein and the ORF1ab-encoded nsp3 [38, 37] , have all been implicated in antagonizing IFN-α/β pathway activation. This provides a likely explanation for our observation that recombinant MERS-CoV lacking p4a and p4b was still able to suppress IFN-β mRNA transcription. MERS-CoV p4a homologs have exclusively been identified in lineage C β-CoVs, which besides MERS-CoV comprises a MERS-like coronavirus found in European hedgehogs [53] , and bat coronaviruses (BatCoV) HKU4 and HKU5 [54] [55] [56] . The p4a-like accessory proteins of these other lineage C viruses all contain dsRNA-binding motifs and may therefore have similar functions as MERS-CoV p4a. Yet, a study by Siu et al. indicated that p4a of BatCoV-HKU4, in contrast to that of MERS-CoV and BatCoV-HKU5, does not bind poly(I: C) and does not inhibit IFN-α/β responses [22] . If BatCoV-HKU4 p4a is indeed unable to sequester dsRNA, then it is likely unable to suppress the dsRNA-triggered stress response pathway as well. Interestingly, sequence analysis of a MERS-CoV strain isolated from patients in Jordan identified a 16 amino acid deletion in p4a [57] . This deletion does not affect the residues comprising the dsRNA binding site. However, as it removes the second β-strand in the classical αβββα-fold of the dsRNA binding domain, p4a's dsRNA binding properties and, in consequence, its function as antagonist, are most likely compromised. If so, stress antagonism by p4a may be dispensable for MERS-CoV replication and transmission among humans. Increasing evidence suggests that coronavirus accessory proteins often have niche-specific (e.g. organ-or tissue-specific) or host-tailored functions. For example, accessory protein 3c is required for replication of low-virulence feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), which primarily replicates in the enteric tract, but not for replication of FECV-derived, highly virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) isolates, which have acquired the ability to replicate in macrophages [58, 59] . Also, accessory proteins contributing to viral fitness in one particular host species may sometimes prove less important in a novel host following a species-jump. For example, in SARS-CoV and CoV-229E some accessory genes were lost through gradual deletion following the introduction of these viruses into humans [60, 61] . Acquisition as well as loss of accessory proteins may reflect adaptations to different immunological environments in different niches or hosts. In this study, we showed that MERS-CoV p4a can potently antagonize innate antiviral responses in human cells. Yet, as suggested by the Jordan outbreak, p4a may not be critical for zoonotic transmission nor for limited human-to-human spread, possibly because of redundancy in viral anti-stress response strategies. Whether p4a will be lost or maintained in the hapless event MERS-CoV establishes sustained community transmission remains an open question.  Cell culture and viruses  HeLa-R19, Huh7 and BHK-21 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (V/V) fetal calf serum (FCS). Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium with 8% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine and non-essential amino acids.MERS-CoV infections [62] were carried out as described previously [24, 63] inside biosafety cabinets in BSL III facilities at Leiden University Medical Center and Universidad Autonoma de Madrid. Recombinant MERS-CoVs that were used in Madrid have been described previously [63] . Recombinant MERS-CoVs that were used in Leiden were derived from the previously described infectious MERS-CoV clone pBAC-MERS FL [63] , and adapted as follows using two step en-passant in vivo recombineering reactions in E. coli [64] . The CMV promoter at the 5'end of the MERS-CoV cDNA sequence was replaced by a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and a unique NotI linearization site was inserted at the 3'end, so that the virus could be launched from transfecting in vitro synthesized RNA transcripts (produced using an mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 transcription kit from ThermoFisher scientific). To construct MERS-CoV-ΔORF4 from this adapted clone, the coding sequence of MERS-CoV p4a/p4b was removed and replaced by a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene, which however for unclear reasons did not result in red fluorescence during infection. All the genetic modifications to the original pBAC-MERS FL were verified by sequencing. The MERS-CoVΔORF4 virus grew to similar titers as the recombinant wt MERS-CoV derived from the original clone.Recombinant EMCV viruses were derived from the pM16.1 infectious clone [65] . The pStrep2-VFETQG-Zn-M16.1 infectious clone was constructed using site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) using the pCVB3-3C pro -QG-M16.1 as template DNA [32] . The Zn-finger mutation in L was introduced by SDM using the following oligonucleotides: Fw; 5'-ATGACCTTTGAAGA AGCCCCAAAAGCCTCCGCCTTACAATAC-3' and Rv; 5'-GGAATGAGCACAAATCTC TTG-3' . The optimized 3C pro recognition site (VFETQG) was introduced by SDM using the following oligonucleotides: Fw; 5'-GAAACTCAAGGCGCAACGACTATGGAGC-3' and Rv; 5'-AAAGACCGCGGCCGCTTGCTCATCATTG-3' . Finally, the Strep2-tag was introduced by SDM using the following oligonucleotides: Fw; 5'-GGCCGCCTGGTCACATCCTCAGTTTG AGAAGGGTGCCTGGTCTCATCCCCAATTCGAAAA-3' and Rv: 5'-GGCCTTTTCGAAT TGGGGATGAGACCAGGCACCCTTCTCAAACTGAGGATGTGACCAGGC-3' . Genes of interest were inserted into the XhoI/NotI restriction sites of the pStrep2-VFETQG-Zn-M16.1 infectious clone. Viruses were recovered by transfection of run-off RNA transcripts into BHK-21 cells. Upon total CPE, cells were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles and cell debris was pellet at 4,000xg for 15 minutes. Virus was concentrated by ultracentrifugation though a 30% sucrose cushion at 140,000xg for 16 hours in a SW32Ti rotor.  HeLa-PKR knockout cells  HeLa-R19 PKR KO were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system as previously described [66] . Briefly, gRNA encoding oligonucleotides cassettes to target human PKR (gRNA1: 5'-ACCGGA CCTCCACATGATAGG-3' and 5'-AACCCTATCATGTGGAGGTCC-3' , gRNA2: 5'-CCG TACTACTCCCTGCTTCTGA G-3' and 5'-AAACTCAGAAGCAGGGAGTAGTA-3') were cloned into the SapI restriction sites of the pCRISPR-hCas9-2xgRNA-Puro plasmid. HeLa-R19 cells were seeded in 6-well clusters (100,000 cells/well) and next day transfected with 2.5 μg plasmid DNA using Fugene6 (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. Next day successfully transfected cells were selected using puromycin and single-cell clones were generated using end-point dilutions. Knockout efficiency was determined by sequence analysis of the PKR locus in the genomic DNA and western blot analysis (S1 Fig).  Chemicals and RNA ligands  Arsenic acid was purchased at Sigma-Aldrich and used at a final concentration of 0.5 mM in DMEM. Pateamine A was kindly provided by Prof. Jerry Pelletier [67] and used at a concentration of 100 nM in DMEM. Poly(I:C) was purchased from GE Healthcare and dsRNA ligand was prepared using the Replicator RNAi kit (Finnzymes) using the following oligonucleotides (Fw, possessing T7 promoter sequence) TAATACGACTCACT ATAGGGGATACAGTGAC AGGG CG and (Rv, possessing Phi6 promoter sequence) GGAAAAAAACCGCACCGAATG CGGAG AATTTAC and the pRib-CVB3/T7 Coxsackie virus B3 infectious clone as template [68] . Digested PCR products were ligates into XhoI/BamHI digested pEGFP-N3 plasmid and gene integrity was confirmed by sequencing analysis. pcDNA-RFP expression plasmid was constructed by PCR amplification of the RFP gene using oligonucleotides flanked by NheI (Fw) and NotI (Rv) restriction sites (Fw) GCTAGCGCCACAACCATGGCCTCCTCCGAGGAC and (Rv) GCGGCCGCCGGCGCCG GTGGAGTGGCGGCCCTC and subsequently cloning into the NheI/NotI digested pcDNA-EGFP plasmid [69] . The pJET-puro (puromycin resistance vector) plasmid was developed by ligation of the EF1a-Puro fragment into the pJet1.2/blunt vector (Thermo Fisher). pRL-TK (Renilla luc expression vector) plasmid was purchased from Promega.  Renilla luciferase assay  HeLa-R19 cells were seeded in a 96-wells cluster (5,000 cells/well) and the next day they were transfected with the indicated plasmids (40 ng pEGFP, 10 ng pRL-TK) using Fugene6. 24 hours post transfection, cells were lysed in 20 μl passive lysis buffer (Promega) and analyzed on the Centro LB 960 Microplate Luminometer (Berthold technologies) using the Renilla luciferase reporter kit (Promega) according to manufacturer instructions.  Flow cytometry analysis  Cells were seeded in a 24-wells cluster (50,000 cells/well) and the next day they were transfected with the indicated plasmids (500 ng/well; 250 ng/plasmid) using Fugene6. Twenty-four hours post transfection, cells were released using trypsin, washed once in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 30 minutes with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Cells were analyzed on FACS Canto (BD) using BD FACS Diva software.  Immunofluorescence assay (IFA)  Cells were seeded on glass slides in a 24 wells cluster (25,000 cells/well) and the next day they were infected (MOI = 10) or transfected (500 ng total DNA) using Fugene6. At 6h post infection or 24h post transfection, cells were fixed using 4% PFA in PBS for 30 minutes at RT. Vero cells seeded on glass slides were transfected with 1 μg Poly(I:C) per 6-well using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were permeabilized with PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100, washed trice with blocking buffer (PBS + 2% bovine serum albumin [BSA] + 50mM NH 4 Cl), and incubated with blocking buffer for 1 h. Cell monolayers were incubated for 1 h with primary antibody mouse-α-G3BP1 (BD, 1:1,000), rabbit-α-TIA1 (Santa-Cruz, 1:50), mouse-α-dsRNA (J2, English&Scientific Consulting, 1:1,000), goat-α-eIF3 (Santa-Cruz, 1:100), rabbit-α-G3BP2 (Bethyl Laboratory, 1:200; or Assay Biotech, 1:500), or rabbit-α-MERS-CoV (1:500: raised against the MERS-CoV M carboxyl terminal peptide CRYKAGNYRSPPITADIE-LALLRA), and then for 30 min with secondary antibody donkey-α-mouse-Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:1000), donkey-α-rabbit-Alexa488 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:1000), bovine-α-goat-Alexa647 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:1000), donkey-α-rabbit-Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:200), donkey-α-mouse-Alexa 488 (Invitrogen, 1:200) or donkey-α-goat-Alexa 594 (Invitrogen, 1:200) and Hoechst-33258 (1:2,000) diluted in blocking buffer. Between and after the incubations, the cell monolayers were washed three times with blocking buffer. Finally, the cells were washed once with distilled water and coverslips were mounted on glass slides in FluorSafe (Calbiochem). Cells were examined by confocal microscopy (Leica SPE-II).  Western blot analysis  Cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes (2.5 x 10 6 cells/dish) and the next day cells were infected (MOI = 10) or transfected (8 μg plasmid DNA) using Fugene6. At 6h post infection or 24h post transfection, cells were released using trypsin, washed once in wash buffer (100 mM Tris/HCl pH 8,0 + 1 mM EDTA + 50 mM NaCl) and lysed in 200 μl lysis buffer (100 mM Tris/HCl pH 8,0 + 1 mM EDTA + 50 mM NaCl + 1% NP40 + protease inhibitor mix [Roche] + phosphatase inhibitor cocktails #2 and #3 [Sigma-Aldrich]). Cell debris was pelleted at 15,000 x g for 15 min and 10 μl of cleared cell lysates were resolved using reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membranes by wet electrophoretic transfer. Membranes were washed once with washing buffer (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated 1h in blocking buffer (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 + 2% BSA). Membranes were successively incubated for 1 h with primary antibody mouse-α-PKR (BD, 1:1,000), rabbit-α-PKR-P [T446] (Abcam, 1:2.000), mouse-α-Tubulin (Sigma, 1:5.000), rabbit-α-mengovirus capsid (kindly provided by Prof. Ann Palmenberg, 1:1.000) or mouse-α-StrepMab classic (IBA, 1:1.000) and then for 30 min with goat-α-mouse-IRDye680 (Li-COR, 1:15,000) or goat-α-rabbit-IRDye800 (Li-COR, 1:15,000) diluted in blocking buffer. Between and after the incubations, the membranes were washed, thrice each time, with washing buffer. Finally, membranes were washed once with PBS and scanned using an Odyssey Imager (Li-COR).

28553293	A Role for Neutrophils in Viral Respiratory Disease	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5427094/	Neutrophils are immune cells that are well known to be present during many types of lung diseases associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may contribute to acute lung injury.

Thus, comparative analyses of the relationship between IAV infection and neutrophils provide insights into the relative contribution of host and viral factors that contribute to disease severity. Herein, we review the contribution of neutrophils to IAV disease pathogenesis and to other respiratory virus infections.Keywords: neutrophil, influenza, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory virus, viral microenvironment iNTRODUCTiON Neutrophils are a type of polymorphonuclear granulocyte that differentiate from myeloblasts in the bone marrow to comprise approximately 60% of the circulating blood leukocytes (1) . The formation of intracellular granules (azurophilic granules, specific granules, gelatinase granules, and secretory vesicles) and the morphologically characteristic segmentation of nuclei occur during the terminal differentiation process into neutrophils (1) . Neutrophils are often considered professional bacteria-responsive immune cells: they express bacteria-specific receptors (e.g., formylated peptide receptors or certain toll-like receptors, "TLRs") and their granules have anti-bacterial or bacteriostatic properties. Currently, their role in viral infection has received very little scientific attention (2) .Neutrophils are present during many types of lung diseases associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may contribute to acute lung injury (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . The lung has a global inflammatory response to infection regardless of etiology, and this response includes the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in response to chemotactic signaling which originates in the lung (3, 5, (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . These phagocytic cells leave circulation and hone to sites within the infected airways where they may deploy potent effector functions to control disease (Figure 1 ) in response to pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (21, 22) . In the case of viral infections, the type I interferons (IFN) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) signal an appropriate immune response (23-26). Lethal infections may result from insufficient information or incorrect information about the specific cause(s) of infection, thereby signaling inappropriate (incorrect or excessive) immune responses (27) . Neutrophils, as first-responders to many forms of airway infection, may be a keystone species in determining viral disease outcome; however, neutrophils are poorly studied with respect to viral infection and specifically to respiratory viral disease.Much research has focused on the role of neutrophils in severe versus mild respiratory disease, as well as their role in bacterial infections. It is, therefore, important to establish a general role of neutrophils in respiratory virus infection to provide a groundwork into more specific questions (e.g., are neutrophils capable of catering to a virus-specific response?). Herein, the evidence for the presence and activities of neutrophils during respiratory viral infection is reviewed. Having established spatio-temporal aspects of the neutrophil response to influenza A virus (IAV), the potential antiviral function(s) of neutrophils during acute virus infection as well as recovery from infection are discussed. The discussion will focus on IAV and neutrophil activities during the course of a "typical" flu infection: activation, migration, and effector functions in situ (Figure 1) . IAV are particularly wellsuited for the study of neutrophils in viral respiratory disease, since they are well-studied in humans and animal models, and it is well-established that infection with specific viral variants (i.e., genetic point mutations) alter the course of disease from mild to severe (28). More recently, specific IAV viral variants that affect pathogenicity have been linked to alterations of the neutrophil response (29). Thus, a comparison of the neutrophil response between disease phenotypes of a single virus species (Influenza A virus) may elucidate a role for neutrophils in the viral microenvironment. Herein, we review evidence of neutrophil responses during the course of disease in various IAV phenotypes in animal models of infection, as well as comparing these responses to what is known about neutrophil responses during bacterial infection of the airways.  iNFLUeNZA A viRAL PHeNOTYPeS  Influenza A virus poses a concern for global public health due to emergence of strains with increased human transmission and/or increased pathology (30-35). In 2009, a novel virus type, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 IAV, emerged with an increased transmission rate and greater disease, i.e., moderate to severe patho logy relative to seasonal human IAV (36-50). Clinical isolates of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 have relatively little genetic variability yet cause variable clinical outcomes from moderate to severe pathology, including ARDS (39, 41, 47, 48, 51). Therefore, they are well-suited to understand host and viral contributions to IAV pathogenesis. A detailed discussion of the viral replicative cycle is beyond this review, yet excellent reviews are plentiful [e.g., Ref. (52-54)]. IAV is a well-studied model for virus infection in laboratory animals, such as mice and ferrets, and much is known about the contributions of viral and host determinants to severe disease (55-58). Retrospective and experimental infection studies routinely demonstrate common occurrences in the formation of severe IAV [including severe influenza pneumonia (SIP) and ARDS] in humans, ferrets, and mice; these include increased cytokine secretions in the lung, diffuse alveolar damage ("DAD, " bronchointerstitial pneumonia in veterinary pathology), and neutro philic infiltration (29, 55, 58-66).In general, IAV infection is an excellent model to investigate the respiratory system's immune response to viral infection, specifically the pathway leading to severe pneumonia and/or ARDS. Influenza disease is commonly relatively mild and self-limiting, although highly pathogenic forms exist (42, 59, 67-72). The major complication from IAV infection is the formation of SIP which may develop into ARDS (59, 65, 67, 68, 70-73). The reason(s) why infection with IAV may lead to severe viral pneumonia and ARDS is poorly understood, but is thought to involve both host and viral factors. The respective and combined contributions of the host innate immune response and viral factors to the timing and severity of SIP are poorly understood. Neutrophils are present in the respiratory tract during infection with mild seasonal IAV, SIP, and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses ["HPAI, " which includes avian influenza A (H5N1) virus] (50, 51, 65, 67, 68, 74-76). During SIP and HPAI infection, an increase in the number of neutrophils in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) is correlated with disease severity (50, 51, 65, 67, 68, 76).Although clinical pathology suggests that a spectrum of disease results from IAV infection, there are at least three disease "phenotypes" caused by infection with IAV, listed by increasing case fatality rate: a mild upper respiratory tract (URT) infection, a SIP which can lead to ARDS, and a LRT infection which can lead to hypercytokinemia. The virological basis for disease phenotype is related to adaptations to mammals-most important are receptor specificity and efficiency of replication-and the major mechanisms have been defined through the use of experimental animal models (30, 32, 33, 57, 77-80). An "ideal" viral infection (i.e., one that is successful for the virus and non-lethal for the host) may be considered a balance between virus replication and an immune response necessary to promote viral shedding, typical of mild seasonal ("epidemic") IAV. In general, emergent IAV, directly or indirectly from avian enzootic cycles, have increased pathology in humans, the most fatal form of which is a syndrome of complete immune dysregulation (65, 69, 70, 81-84). IAV is genetically highly variable, and mechanisms for increased disease severity are multifactorial, involving host and viral factors.  Uncomplicated influenza  The majority of yearly, seasonal IAV infections in the world cause a relatively mild, self-limiting URT disease. Influenza disease is characterized by an abrupt onset fever, myalgia, and malaise, with symptoms similar to other URT infections, such as sneezing, coryza, and rhinorrhea (67, 85). Symptoms can last anywhere from 1-5 days and are clinically indistinguishable from other "flu"-like illnesses, including bacterial and viral infections that cause the common cold [e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, human rhinovirus (HRV) infection, Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) infection, and coronavirus infection] (85-88). Experimental infection of humans with IAV suggests that the virus is mainly restricted to the URT, although sampling the LRT is difficult (67, 68, 87, 89). While fever typically begins 2 days postinfection, virus is shed from the URT in nasal secretions as quickly as 24 h postinfection, allowing efficient transmission prior to symptom onset and continues until 4-5 days postinfection (86, 87, 89) (Figure 2) . Rhinorrhea is coincident with neutrophilic rhinitis and shedding of necrotic nasal epithelium (67, 90, 91) . Surprisingly, the LRT seems to be involved in uncomplicated IAV infection, although this observation is frequently overlooked or unaddressed in studies (68, 92). In humans, local and systemic concentrations of IL6, CXCL8/IL8, and MCP1/CCL2 correlate with increased disease severity (i.e., symptom severity and increased virus shedding) (87-89, 93) (Figure 2 ).  Severe influenza Pneumonia  Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus spread quickly throughout the globe, much like previous pandemic viruses, such as the 1918 H1N1 "Spanish flu" IAV. Humans infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus also presented with typical flu-like sym ptoms (e.g., fever, cough); however, there was an increased number of cases presenting with dyspnea, respiratory distress, and pneumonia (36-38, 40-48, 50, 94, 95). Additionally, retrospective assessments show a proportionately greater number of adolescents and adults with severe disease compared to typical seasonal influenza, and patients with comorbidities, such as obesity and asthma, were at higher risk of severe infection (51, 96-98). In general, the virus causes infection of URT, as well as bronchitis and bronchiolitis, and a high proportion of cases presented with severe disease in the form of viral pneumonia (42, 51, 96). Histopathologic changes in autopsies revealed extensive cytonecrosis, desquamation, and inflammatory infiltration of the bronchus and trachea, mild to severe necrotizing bronchiolitis (42, 50, 51, 99). The primary pathologic finding of SIP was sporadic to DAD with hyaline membrane formation, edema, and occasionally hemorrhage (42, 50, 51, 99). As is typical of influenza infections, some patients experienced bacterial coinfection although this was not in a majority of patients, including those dying from ARDS (42, 48, 50, 51, 93, [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] . This may distinguish the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus from the 1918 H1N1 IAV, for which bacterial superinfection was determined to cause a majority of the deaths (104, 105) , although this may more accurately reflect improved hygiene and standard of care. As discussed below, studies of the reconstructed 1918 H1N1 IAV using animal models suggest that this virus was highly pathogenic irrespective of secondary bacterial pneumonia (62, [106] [107] [108] . Across many cohorts of clinical patients, serum concentration of IL6, CCL2, and CXCL8 were significantly elevated in severe cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viral pneumonia compared to patients with other confirmed illnesses including seasonal IAV, milder forms of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, bacterial pneumonia, or other viral respiratory infection [hRSV, HRV, human adenovirus (hAdv)] (93, [100] [101] [102] 109) . These cytokines and chemokines remained elevated over time (up to 6 days following hospital admission) in cases of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viral pneumonia, whereas they decreased as patients recovered from seasonal and mild influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus infection (93, 100). In severe cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection, decreased type I IFN and ISG production was occasionally noticed compared to adult patients with seasonal IAV infection (93). The influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have received much scrutiny, and a large dataset of the genetics and pathogenic phenotypes of virus isolates exists in human and animal models. The H1N1 subtype IAV are highly important viruses due to their pandemic potential, as supported by the historical record (62, 68, 110). Some influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 viruses can infect the LRT in humans and in the ferret animal model, which makes them excellent laboratory viruses to investigate the involvement of the LRT in pathogenesis, specifically in the development of severe disease (42, [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] . Their overall genetic similarity makes for excellent comparison studies between natural clinical isolates, and reverse genetics systems exist to study molecular pathogenicity (41, 95, 113, (116) (117) (118) (119) (120) (121) (122) (123) (124) (125) (126) .  HPAi and Cytokine Storm  Avian IAV has been recorded sporadically entering the human population over the last 20 years, beginning with an H5N1 subtype virus which emerged in China in 1997 (70, 82, 127, 128) .It is likely that this avian influenza A (H5N1) virus and other emergent strains result from contact with infected domestic poultry that are infected with HPAI (82). The disease caused by avian influenza A (H5N1) virus is characterized by DAD, alveolar necrosis, and alveolar hemorrhage [human disease, including pathology, is reviewed in Ref. (83) ]. There is evidence of viremia and systemic spread; IAV antigen has been detected in the trachea, bronchi, and alveolar pneumocytes (69, 76), as well as infrequently in the brain and gastric epithelium (59, 76, 83). The innate cellular immune response in the lungs was characterized by an increase in inter-alveolar macrophages/histiocytes (59, 65, 69, 71, 81, 129) and only moderate infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils in the few patients that were analyzed postmortem (69, 76). Systemically, patient serum had high concentrations of CXCL10, CCL2, IL6, IL8, and IL10 compared to matched-control patients with seasonal H3 and H1 IAV, and these concentrations were correlated with viral load in throat (59, 65, 69). In lethal cases, the result of infection and immune dysregulation led to multiple organ failure (e.g., kidney tubular inflammation, necrotic lesions in brain, impaired liver function) and abnormal clotting. Reactive histiocytes undergoing hemophagocytosis were frequently found in bone marrow and lungs of patients, which is indicative of diseases involving hypercytokinemia (59, 65, 70, 81, 83, 130).Other events involving avian IAV transmission to humans are known and are often associated with veterinary or other animal workers; for example, a 2004 case of avian influenza A (H7N7) virus infection in a veterinarian in Europe showed severe fatal pneumonia and DAD (131) . It was reported that 1 L of serosanguineous fluid was drained from his chest upon autopsy. In 2013, another avian IAV emerged in Southeast Asia; this time an avian influenza A (H7N9) virus (71, 72, 129, 132). The histopathology was similar to avian influenza A (H5N1) virus: severe pneumonia, DAD, and epithelial necrosis were common features of infection with both viruses (71, 72). Therefore, it seems the typical presentation of human patients infected with either virus includes high levels of CXCL10, CCL2, IL-6, and CXCL8 in the plasma, peripheral blood leukopenia, and lung neutrophilia (65, 69, 81, 129, 130, 132) , and this is also similar to experimental infection of laboratory animal models (111, 133) . There were slightly more bacterial coinfections in cases of H7N9 compared to H5N1 avian IAV (71, 72, 81). In a direct comparison, serum from patients with infected with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus had higher concentrations of IFNα and IFNγ in the blood and lower levels of IL8, whereas the opposite was true for patients with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus (134) . Similarly, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were higher in patients with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, whereas CCL4 concentrations were higher in patients with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus (134) . Infection with either virus resulted in higher blood C-reactive protein (CRP) (129) . Variability between patients may account for the apparent discrepancies between specific immune responses. Therefore, experimental infection of laboratory animals removes individual variability and provides a clear picture of general disease progression, with important caveats for their comparison to human disease as discussed in more detail in the next section (58, 135).Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.orgMay 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 550  NeUTROPHiLS iN iAv COURSe OF DiSeASe  Neutrophils are increased in the lungs and blood after infection with pathogenic IAV in mice, humans, and ferrets (28, 136, 137) . Cell depletion studies have demonstrated that neutrophils are necessary for recovery from severe, but not mild, IAV infection (29, 138, 139) . Studies in mice show that neutrophils have effects during both early and late stages of disease (140) . As discussed in detail below, initial pathogen sensing through various pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) stimulates inflammatory signals from resident macrophages to initiate neutrophil chemotaxis to the infected airways (Figure 1 ). For example, TLR7 recognition of IAV dsRNA-and Myd88-mediated release of TNFα and CCL3 by mononuclear cells is important for neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection (141, 142) . Transgenic mice have been used to study the contribution of specific cytokines and chemokines to inflammation following IAV infection, particularly as this relates to "hypercytokinemia, " and are summarized in Tables S1-S4 in Supplementary Material. The signals from the infected lung are propagated systemically by endothelial cells, which recruit and tether neutrophils. The importance of endothelial signaling in the development of severe disease has been shown recently using sphingosine-1 phosphate agonist to prevent severe disease in animal models of both influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (143, 144) . The complex interactions governing neutrophil extravasation, migration through the interstitium, and crossing the alveolar epithelium are well known in relation to many forms of ALI and the development of ARDS with the exception of conditions surrounding viral infection, although mechanistically they should be quite similar (3-5, 7, 145, 146) .  Neutrophil Migration  In the ferret model, the migration of neutrophils to the lungs occurs in two distinct waves: a first wave within hours of challenge, peaking after 24 h then decreasing; and a second wave that increases over time until disease resolution or death (111) (Figure 2 ). In the ferret model, we have shown that the neutrophils become concentrated at specific foci in the lungs coincident with influenza-positive epithelium and the expression of chemoattractant chemokine genes (22). Neutrophil chemotaxis in humans is thought to be mediated by many factors, such as the chemokine CXCL8, cytokines IL-1 and TNFα, and complement C5a (145, 147, 148) . During both mild and severe IAV disease, patients show increased blood CRP and activation of C5a (149), as well as increased secretion of CXCL8, TNFα, and IL-1 in nasal washes, which correlate with disease severity (87, 89, 93, [150] [151] [152] . In the mouse model of influenza virus infection, chemical reduction of C5a during IAV infection reduced lung neutrophilia (153) . Similarly, knockout mice deficient in the inflammasome pathway or mice not expressing cytokines, such as IL-1b and IL-6, have decreased neutrophil activation and migration to the lungs during IAV infection (Table S1 in Supplementary Material) (154) (155) (156) . Mice do not possess CXCL8, but CXCL1 and CXCL2 have equivalent functions. Neutrophils contribute CXCL2 to the IAV-infected mouse lung to further stimulate neutrophil recruitment (157) . More recently, it was shown that removing a CXCL1 repressor (Setdb2) does not increase recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs of mice infected with IAV PR8, rather it reduces the ability to respond to bacterial superinfection (158) . In addition, it was shown that another ISG, CXCL10, operates on a unique subset of CXCR3+ neutrophils present during mouse IAV infection in an autocrine manner, increasing chemotaxis, oxidative burst, and enhancing inflammation (157) (Tables S3 and S4 in Supplementary Material). Finally, aryl hydrocarbon receptor is somehow linked to increases in NO and neutrophilia in the lungs of IAV-infected mice independently of known neutro phil chemoattractants or mechanisms of neutrophil extravasation (159) (160) (161) (162) .  Neutrophil extracellular PRRs and Phagocytosis  In cell coculture, human neutrophils were seen to interact specifically with IAV-infected cells (163), although the nature of this interaction in the infected lung is unknown. Neutrophils are phagocytic cells, and their methods for sensing extracellular pathogens rely on TLRs (2, 147) . Stimulation of neutrophils through cell surface TLRs has been recorded to promote cytokine secretion (CXCL8 and TNFα via NFκB and AP-1), formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), phagocytosis, granule secretion, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and migration (145, 147, 148) . Human neutrophils highly express nucleic aciddetecting TLRs, specifically endosomal TLR8 (164, 165), but do not express nor respond to activators of TLR3 or TLR7 (164) (165) (166) .[Interestingly, TLR3 −/− mice have increased neutrophilia and fewer macrophages in the lungs, yet have increased survival after infection with IAV (167, 168) .] TLR4 is required for LPSinduced neutrophil migration to the lung (169) and can stimulate immunostimulatory responses via TRIF adaptors (170) ; however, TLR4-stimulation does not lead to the production of type I IFN in neutrophils (166, 171) . Several innate immune effector proteins with opsonizing func tions that are present in airway mucosae are known to interact with both IAV and neutrophils. Surfactant protein D, a lung collectin, is an innate immune defense against a variety of viruses, opsonizing the viruses for phagocytosis by neutrophils, which in turn causes the production of ROS (172) (173) (174) (175) (176) (177) (178) . Human neutrophil defensins are short basic peptides released from neutrophil granules during inflammation (145, 178, 179) . They have been shown to interact with IAV, reducing infectivity, and promote neutrophil phagocytosis and clearance of IAV (178) (179) (180) (181) (182) . Defensins may also buffer the oxidative burst from neutrophils that follows from phagocytosis of viruses that have been opsonized by surfactant protein D (178) (179) (180) . One study indicated that neutrophils do not interact with immunoglobulin-bound IAV (183); however, another showed that protective anti-IAV antibody therapy only protected mice in the presence of neutrophils (184) . The hypothesis that IAV pathogenicity can be partially explained by infection with viral variants that can evade opsonization by innate immune effectors is attractive and deserves further study (176) .  Neutrophil intracellular PRRs  Neutrophils express sialic acid receptors and may become infected with IAV (74, 185, 186) . Neutrophils infected with IAV have increased apoptosis, but infection does not result in the production of virus (186) . Infection of human neutrophils with IAV treated at 56°C to denature the viral replicase but not HA suggested that infection alone, but not replication, is sufficient to stimulate the release of CXCL8 and CCL4 in human neutrophils (187) . Neutrophils infected with IAV have rapid upregulation (<9 hpi) of type I IFN pathways, including cytoplasmic PRRs, IFNβ, and ISGs (186) , which is counter to the long-held dogma that neutrophils were incapable of gene expression. This is may be due to RIG-like receptors (RLRs) sensing of viral dsRNA, as neutrophils transfected with poly(I:C) (a viral RNA mimic) have a similar response (166) . Additionally, neutrophils express nodlike receptors but it is unclear how these interact with IAV infection (188, 189) . In general, inflammasome and pro-IL1 activation following IAV infection is poorly understood (154, 155, 190, 191) . However, studies of IAV infection using caspase-1, IL-1β, or IL-1R transgenic mice show modulation of neutrophil infiltration and pathology and suggest that it is an IAV subtype-dependent effect (154, (191) (192) (193) (194) (195) (Tables S1 and S2 in Supplementary Material). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the HA of some IAV isolates suppresses neutrophil activation, providing further evidence for IAV subtype-dependent effects on neutrophils (185, 186, 196) .  Neutrophil Activation and Degranulation  Activation of TLRs and RLRs trigger degranulation and the expression of surface CD11b (166) , which pairs with CD18 to form the "Mac-1" integrin dimer that binds collagen (197) . This facilitates migration through tissues, and release of gelatinase or collagenase (MMP-2 and MMP-9) from neutrophils assist in clearing connective tissue from the path. At the site of infection, neutrophils release microbial effectors [reviewed in Ref. (145, 198) ]. Neutrophils develop granules sequentially (azurophilic, specific, gelatinase, secretory) and secrete granules in the reverse order (145) . Secretory and gelatinase granules are released shortly after endothelial transmigration and contain membrane proteins essential for movement [extracellular matrix (ECM)-binding integrins] and pathogen recognition [immunoglobulin (FcR) and complement receptors] (145) . Specific and azurophilic granules contain tissue-destroying enzymes and antimicrobial proteins. For example, neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) may contribute to lung injury during IAV infection (199) ; however, it may have direct antiviral effects on IAV (200) . An investigation found no difference between IAV infection of a wild-type and neutrophil elastase knockout mouse, measuring lung function, chemokine secretion, and neutrophil recruitment (201) (Table S5 in Supplementary Material). The contents of the granules can be secreted to destroy ECM (such as MMP-9) or directed toward phagosomes to destroy engulfed microbes. The production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is the main oxidant used in phagosomal killing, and its production is dependent on the generation of ROS by the neutrophils. Interestingly, infection by IAV was related to the inhibition of phagosomal killing of bacteria (196) .Neutrophil degranulation primes neutrophils for ROS generation by mobilizing NADPH oxidase components to the plasma membrane (145) and exocytosis of MPO. IAV infection causes the generation of ROS in neutrophils (202) . Oxidative burst is thought to have direct microbial effects; however, the direct effect on IAV has not been published (203) . IAV infection benefits from the presence of ROS in the environment (204, 205) , yet IAV also suppresses NADPH oxidase activity within infected phagocytes (206, 207) . Many have investigated the effects of ROS and NO on lung inflammation during IAV infection and found that reduction of oxidative stress in the form of both ROS and NO alieves IAV-dependent lung injury (206, (208) (209) (210) (211) (212) (213) (Table S5 in Supplementary Material). For example, oxidized lipids in the lung environment may trigger TLR4, activating immune cells and contributing to increased lung injury (214) (215) (216) .  Neutrophil Netosis  Neutrophils undergo a form of programmed cell death called netosis, in which NETs are formed (217) . NETs are extracellular strands DNA wrapped in histones and enriched in neutrophil effector proteins (e.g., neutrophil elastase and MPO) (218) . NETs have the effect of killing many pathogens, including bacteria (146) , fungi (219), protozoans (220), and more recently viruses (221) . NETs are becoming the focus of study in autoimmune disease atherosclerosis, since they damage endothelium (222) (223) (224) . Recently, it was shown that hantavirus stimulates NET production during infection, which leads to the generation of autoantibodies and may provide a mechanism for the hemorrhagic fever caused by Old World hantaviruses (225) . NETs are typically found with histones, MPO, and neutrophil elastase, and the effect is to isolate the effects of these molecules directly onto the pathogen surface with a "sticky" NET of nucleic acid. NETs contribute to acute lung injury and alveolar capillary damage during IAV infection (139) . Yet, very little is known about the relationship between NETs and viral infection in viral disease pathogenesis (226) .In summary, neutrophils are capable of recognizing viruses via PRRs as either opsonized virions or via endosomal TLR. Although the signaling cascade differs from other phagocytic cells, neutrophils are capable of responding to viral PAMPs with respiratory burst, degranulation of proteases and cytokines, and/ or netosis. It is not clear if these responses are effective against influenza virus; in fact, evidence exists that suggest influenza viruses may take advantage of the inflammatory environment. More importantly, it is not clear if there are differences in response to different influenza virus subtypes or strains. As is true for many respiratory etiologies, neutrophil responses must be balanced during influenza virus infection to adequately control of inflammation while promoting pro-immune responses. The timing of neutrophils during disease progression correlates with a key point in divergent disease outcomes (Figure 2) , and neutrophils may act both globably and locally at foci of infection (22, 111) . Thus, neutrophils are focused in the airways at critical timepoints following infection and therefore balancing their potent inflammatory effector functions may determine disease outcome.   COMPARiSONS OF NeUTROPHiLS iN viRAL ReSPiRATORY DiSeASeS  As discussed above, there appears to be a correlation between the timing and location of IAV infection and the action of neutro phils, but evidence directly linking these phenomena together remains overall circumstantial. In contrast, during bac terial pneumonia there is direct evidence of the importance of neutrophils in disease: bacterial PAMPs directly upregulate neutrophil activating and chemoattractant chemokines, bacteria have defined antineutrophil functions, and some bacteria, e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, rely on neutrophils to establish their granulomatous niche (6, 227, 228) . Similarly, we suggest that viruses may interact with respiratory cells to create a viral microenvironmental niche.To further substantiate a link between neutrophils and virus infection, evidence for the role of neutrophils in selected viral respiratory diseases is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Discussion below focuses on common patterns of neutrophil responses in severe and mild forms of respiratory viral infection. Clinically defined, ARDS has three phases; and most patents die within the first phase, the acute or "exudative" phase [reviewed in Ref. (12-14) ]. This phase is characterized by an increased immune response with high production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, increased neutrophil infiltration and accumulation in the alveoli, and disruption of the alveolar epithelial-capillary barrier, which leads to increased vascular permeability and edema (13). The distinctive role for lung neutrophil infiltration in viral infection is summarized as follows: some, but not all, viruses that infect the LRT result in clinically defined ARDS, and lung neutrophil infiltration is associated with viruses that do and do not lead to ARDS (3, 5, 9, 10, 60, 131, 199, 242-244, 246, 247) . In ARDS, there are data that directly support the role of neutrophils as both beneficial and detrimental (3, 13, 14) . Perhaps, there are general factors (host or virus) that lead to a common antiviral response of neutrophils.  Mild viral Respiratory Disease  In contrast to emergent highly pathogenic respiratory viruses, notable "mild" human respiratory viruses also involve increased neutrophils at the site of infection (e.g., hRSV). As expected, infection with these viruses is typically associated with the increase of neutrophil chemoattractant chemokines. For example, infection with HRV is a well-studied virus for which there are several studies on the link between neutrophils and disease (229-231, 248) ( Table 2) . HRV virions enter nasal epithelial cells via endocytosis, yet, unlike influenza, infection does not cause major damage to the nasal epithelium (249) (250) (251) . Neutrophilic rhinitis, increased vascular permeability, and mucus hypersecretion are the key pathological features of HRV infection (229) (230) (231) 249) , and infected epithelium seems to be the source of large amounts of neutrophil chemotactic molecules, particularly CXCL8 and kinins (229, 248, 252, 253) . Interestingly, in vitro studies have shown that viral recognition of HRV shares features with hRSV, but is somewhat different than with IAV (254) (255) (256) . It has been established that there are virus-specific and cell-specific differences in sensing RNA viruses via primarily TLR-and/or RLRpathways (and even in a preference for RIG-I versus MDA5), yet these pathways may have similar general endpoints, such as chemokine and cytokine signaling (255, (257) (258) (259) .Finally, a key question is whether virus-induced cytopathy drives neutrophilia or whether it is the result of host response to viral infection. Infections with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, HPAI, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are thought to cause acute lung injury which results in ARDS; characterized by excessive damage to the alveolar epithelium and involving the infiltration of neutrophils (67, 68) (Tables 1 and 2) . However, less pathogenic strains such as HRV infections do not cause significant damage to the respiratory mucosa, yet neutrophils are present (249, 250) . Conversely, viruses that cause moderate, focal cytopathy in the lungs, for example seasonal IAV and hRSV, are known to cause neutrophilic infiltration (250, 252, 253) . Therefore, neutrophils are not necessarily associated with direct cytopathic effect nor are they exclusively associated with severe disease.  bacterial Respiratory Disease  Despite many years of searching, there is no single reliable biomarker to indicate a bacterial versus viral infection (although CRP is a good candidate). This is surprising, given the otherwise significant fundamental differences between the biology of these two types of pathogens; differences which are reflected in general immune responses and begin with pathogen detection. Signaling through TLR on the plasma membrane versus endosomal or cytoplasmic PRRs is controlled by complex intracellular adaptor proteins [reviewed in Ref. (260) ]. For example, the complexities of signaling allow the characteristically bacteria-specific TLR4 to signal the upregulation of immunostimulatory type I IFN characteristic of a virus infection (170) . As evidenced above, many viral infections associated with neutrophil infiltration have RNA genomes. Host cells detect RNA viruses primarily through RLR as well as TLR, whereas bacteria rely on a different group of PRRs to detect extracellular PAMPs (255, (261) (262) (263) . Interestingly, the lung microenvironment to hRSV has been shown to be different from IAV, specifically in the presence of IL-4 (264, 265) . It is thought that this is driven by the presence of alternatively activated macrophages during RSV infection (266) . It is not known if this directs differences in neutrophil chemoattraction, yet IL-4 is known to drive a Th2 ("bacterial" or antibody-biased) immune response (267) . In sum, surprisingly little is clinically different between the innate immune responses to viral versus bacterial infection; however, perhaps comparative studies that focus on neutrophils can uncover virus-specific responses.  NeUTROPHiLS iN THe viRAL MiCROeNviRONMeNT  In general, immune activation pathways that involve the activation of NFκB lead to the secretion of neutrophil chemotactic chemokines [reviewed in Ref. (268) ]. This is heavily driven by PAMP recognition and activation pathways, and during a viral infection type I IFNs and ISGs are the unique elements in the virus-inflamed lung environment [reviewed in Ref. (24-26, 269, 270) ]. This single difference between viral and bacterial infections could have drastic effects on the actions of neutrophils once in the lung. Moreover, without this information (e.g., pathogenic viruses that suppress type I IFN) neutrophils may respond to inflammation in an inefficient way, potentially with pathologic effects (23, 186, 256, [271] [272] [273] [274] [275] [276] [277] . Neutrophils are known to respond to IAV and type I IFN by upregulation of ISGs (186) . In systemic lupus erythematosus, neutrophils may be a large contributor of type I IFN (278, 279). During increased inflammation, left-shifted or immature neutrophils emerge from the bone marrow-a classic sign for sepsis, but also known to be present during some severe viral respiratory diseases (e.g., HPS) (239) . It is known that immature neutrophils do neither express IFNα/β receptor nor many other cytokine receptors (273) . It is unknown what affect this would have during increased inflammation during pathogenic influenza infection, although their role in other inflammatory conditions suggests it may affect their functions (271, 273, 280, 281) .  Resolving inflammation  All forms of respiratory infection require resolution of the infection and inflammation. IFNs are essential components of initiating sterilizing immunity to virus infection via the adaptive immune system (i.e., resolution of infection), at which point the resolution of inflammation can effectively proceed (25, 26, 282) . Although the mechanisms are poorly understood, through their direct antiviral actions and indirect actions on the lung microenvironment (e.g., efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages), neutrophils have the ability to influence outcomes toward successful resolution as well as toward the formation of ARDS (3, 5, 12, 13, 21, 74, 166, 184, 198, 199, (283) (284) (285) . Thus, there is evidence that the role of neutrophils in viral infections of the respiratory system is not limited to inflammation, but likely includes recovery from infection and the initiation of adaptive immunity (74, 138, 284) . Apart from initiating adaptive immunity, resolution of inflammation may be partially regulated by secretion of IL-1RA and chemokine-destroying factors by recruited macrophages (286, 287) . Additionally, it has been proposed that efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils is a key step in resolution of inflammation (288) (289) (290) , and occurs in the lung during bacterial pneumonia (291) . It is unclear if this happens during IAV infection or infection with other respiratory viruses.  Prolonging inflammation  Factors that prolong the life span of neutrophils in the lungs increase the probability that they may contribute to immunopathology. IL-6 and G-CSF are immune mediators present in the lung during infection and are known to prolong survival of neutrophils in mouse lungs following IAV infection (292) . Both neutrophils and macrophages are known to phagocytose apoptotic epithelial cells in mouse lungs during IAV infection (283) . The cells may be recruited via chemokines or damage receptors. For example, necrotic IAV-infected epithelial cells are a source of CXCL8 (293) , which attract neutrophils to dying cells. In addition, neutrophils can detect DAMPs such as S100A9 (294) . It has been shown that extracellular S100A9 is abundant during IAV infection in mice (295) . Antibodymediated neutralization of S100A9 decreased lung inflammation in mice and improved disease outcome (295) . Apart from potential tissue-destroying effects of neutrophil proteases, the presence of NETs may induce even more inflammation in the lungs (21, 139). Thus, there are limited data supporting directly malevolent actions of neutrophils (Table S5 in Supplementary Material), yet factors that increase their presence and prolong their survival in the lung are correlated with increased disease severity.  CONCLUDiNg ReMARKS  There are substantial data that suggest neutrophils are a part of a viral response to infection. Neutrophils are among the first responders to IAV infection in the lung, and they remain in great numbers throughout the development of ARDS. Although neutrophils are an important component of the general response to infection in the respiratory system, as is discussed herein, neutrophils are capable of recognizing viruses (via viral PAMPs), responding to viruses with specific effector functions, and may be instrumental in determining disease outcome. Evidence exists to support the hypothesis that neutrophils respond specifically to the focal nature of viral infection, and they act to influence this microenvironment via their virus-specific effector functions. Factors that influence successful recovery from respiratory viral infection (versus lethal outcome) are complex and both host-and virus-specific. However, a better understanding of the role neutrophils, previously underappreciated with respect to viral infections, will reveal important information about disease outcome. Many questions remain before it is determined the part neutrophils play in mild and severe disease.

29467317	Bovine Nebovirus Interacts with a Wide Spectrum of Histo-Blood Group Antigens	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5899197/	Some viruses within the Caliciviridae family initiate their replication cycle by attachment to cell surface carbohydrate moieties, histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), and/or terminal sialic acids (SAs). Although bovine nebovirus (BNeV), one of the enteric caliciviruses, is an important causative agent of acute gastroenteritis in cattle, its attachment factors and possibly other cellular receptors remain unknown. Using a comprehensive series of protein-ligand biochemical assays, we sought to determine whether BNeV recognizes cell surface HBGAs and/or SAs as attachment factors. It was found that BNeV virus-like particles (VLPs) bound to A type/H type 2/Le(y) HBGAs expressed in the bovine digestive tract and are related to HBGAs expressed in humans and other host species, suggesting a wide spectrum of HBGA recognition by BNeV. BNeV VLPs also bound to a large variety of different bovine and human saliva samples of all ABH and Lewis types, supporting previously obtained results and suggesting a zoonotic potential of BNeV transmission. Removal of α1,2-linked fucose and α1,3/4-linked fucose epitopes of target HBGAs by confirmation-specific enzymes reduced the binding of BNeV VLPs to synthetic HBGAs, bovine and human saliva, cultured cell lines, and bovine small intestine mucosa, further supporting a wide HBGA binding spectrum of BNeV through recognition of α1,2-linked fucose and α1,3/4-linked fucose epitopes of targeted HBGAs. However, removal of terminal α2,3- and α2,6-linked SAs by their specific enzyme had no inhibitory effects on binding of BNeV VLPs, indicating that BNeV does not use terminal SAs as attachment factors. Further details of the binding specificity of BNeV remain to be explored. IMPORTANCE Enteric caliciviruses such as noroviruses, sapoviruses, and recoviruses are the most important etiological agents of severe acute gastroenteritis in humans and many other mammalian host species. They initiate infection by attachment to cell surface carbohydrate moieties, HBGAs, and/or terminal SAs. However, the attachment factor(s) for BNeV, a recently classified enteric calicivirus genus/type species, remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that BNeV VLPs have a wide spectrum of binding to synthetic HBGAs, bovine and human saliva samples, and bovine duodenal sections. We further discovered that α1,2-linked fucose and α1,3/4-linked fucose epitopes are essential for binding of BNeV VLPs. However, BNeV VLPs do not bind to terminal SAs on cell carbohydrates. Continued investigation regarding the proteinaceous receptor(s) will be necessary for better understanding of the tropism, pathogenesis, and host range of this important viral genus.					1	1			
29875467	Prophylactic efficacy of orally administered Bacillus poly-γ-glutamic acid, a non-LPS TLR4 ligand, against norovirus infection in mice	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5989232/	Poly-gamma-glutamic acid (γ-PGA), an extracellular biopolymer produced by Bacillus sp., is a non-canonical toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist. Here we show its antiviral efficacy against noroviruses. γ-PGA with a molecular mass of 2,000-kDa limited murine norovirus (MNV) replication in the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 by inducing interferon (IFN)-β and conferred resistance to viral infection-induced cell death. Additionally, γ-PGA interfered with viral entry into cells. The potent antiviral state mounted by γ-PGA was not attributed to the upregulation of TLR4 or TLR3, a sensor known to recognize norovirus RNA. γ-PGA sensing by TLR4 required the two TLR4-associated accessory factors MD2 and CD14. In ex vivo cultures of mouse ileum, γ-PGA selectively increased the expression of IFN-β in villi. In contrast, IFN-β induction was negligible in the ileal Peyer’s patches (PPs) where its expression was primarily induced by the replication of MNV. Oral administration of γ-PGA, which increased serum IFN-β levels without inducing proinflammatory cytokines, reduced MNV loads in the ileum with PPs and mesenteric lymph nodes in mice. Our results disclose a γ-PGA-mediated non-conventional TLR4 signaling in the ileum, highlighting the potential use of γ-PGA as a prophylactic antiviral agent against noroviruses.	Induction of IFN-β expression by γ-PGA inhibits mouse norovirus replication and viral infectioninduced cell death.  HuNoV infection causes epithelial apoptosis and downregulates the level of tight junction proteins involved in sealing, leading to diarrhea 29 . Comparably, murine norovirus (MNV) infection also induces apoptosis in RAW264.7 cells 30 . In the absence of a robust cell culture system for HuNoV 31 , we used murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1), as a surrogate model for HuNoV, to test for the inhibition of virus-induced cell death by γ-PGA. We first determined the range of multiplicity of infection (MOI) of MNV in which viral infection-induced apoptosis is triggered during the course of viral infection. As shown in Fig. 1a , infection of RAW264.7 cells with MNV at an MOI of ≥0.005 produced ≥1 × 10 11 viral RNA copies/ml of media within 30 h. With an MOI ≤0.0005, there was a >10-fold reduction in viral RNA levels, delaying the progress of cell death within 2 days. Accordingly, we used an MOI of 0.005 for infecting cells to assess the impact of γ-PGA. As shown in Fig. 1b , treatment with 2,000-kDa γ-PGA significantly inhibited MNV infection-induced cell death as visualized by live cell staining, with a 4.4-fold increase in IFN-β mRNA expression than in non-treated control cells. γ-PGA dose-dependently prevented virus-induced cell death resulting in increased cell viability (from approximately 40% to 80% at 200 nM; Fig. 1c ), demonstrating the potent antiviral activity of this non-canonical TLR4 ligand against MNV.Furthermore, treatment with 100 nM γ-PGA resulted in a 98% decrease in plaque titer and significantly reduced the level of VP1, a viral structural protein (Fig. 1d) . The antiviral potency of 2,000-kDa γ-PGA was comparable to that of 17-DMAG ( Supplementary Fig. 1 , mean 50% effective concentration of 17-DMAG: 35 nM), an Hsp90 inhibitor that has been recently shown to be effective in controlling MNV infection 32 . The antiviral activity of 2,000-kDa γ-PGA was not attenuated by co-treatment with 500-kDa γ-PGA at 100 nM or 500 nM, suggesting the importance of molecular mass or a specific structure formed by 2,000-kDa γ-PGA for the activation of TLR4 signaling.γ-PGA inhibits norovirus replication and entry without upregulating TLR expression. Inhibition of MNV by 2,000-kDa γ-PGA was further verified by measuring intracellular viral genome titers. γ-PGA reduced viral genome titer by up to 92% in cells infected with a low MOI (0.000005). Its inhibitory effect decreased slightly (86% inhibition) at an MOI of 0.05 (Fig. 2a) . Additionally, it led to a 30% reduction in the level of Norwalk virus sub-genomic replicon (derived from a GI strain of HuNoV) at 100 nM. In HG23 cell line, 500-kDa γ-PGA had little impact on the replication of sub-genomic replicon (Fig. 2b) . The HG23 replicon cell line derived from the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh7 normally fails to respond to TLR4 ligands because of the low-level expression of TLR4 expression together with the lack of the expression of its accessory proteins, CD14 and MD2 6 . Thus, the insufficient, transient expression of TLR4 and the associated accessory proteins might have contributed to the relatively lower inhibitory effect. The critical role of these accessory proteins in γ-PGA sensing and TLR4-mediated IFN-β expression was further investigated in human embryonic kidney 293 T cells (HEK293T), which express no endogenous TLR4, MD2, and CD14 33, 34 . By confocal microscopy, we found that γ-PGA sensing and intracellular entry occurred upon ectopic expression of both TLR4 and its two known accessory factors ( Supplementary Fig. 2a-c) . Substantial induction of IFN-β expression and IRF-3 activation were observed only when TLR4, MD2, and CD14 were expressed ( Supplementary Fig. 2d ). This TLR4-mediated IFN-β induction capability of γ-PGA was also verified in RAW264.7 cells in which RNAi-mediated depletion of TLR4 abrogated IFN-β expression and IRF-3 activation ( Supplementary Fig. 2e ).Pre-treatment of cells (6 h before infection) with 2,000-kDa γ-PGA significantly increased its antiviral activity compared to post-infection treatment (1 h after infection) (Fig. 2c) . This finding suggests that treatment with γ-PGA predisposes cells to acquire resistance to viral infection that is effective in suppressing MNV propagation. Additionally, the observation raised the possibility of γ-PGA interfering with the entry of MNV. Accordingly, a virus entry assay using Q-dot-conjugated norovirus was conducted. The result indicated the capability of γ-PGA to block the entry of norovirus into RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 2d,e) and explains a relatively lower antiviral activity in HG23 replicon cells than in MNV-infected macrophage cells.Upon virus infection, upregulation of TLR4 or crosstalk between TLR signaling pathways 35 might alter the sensitivity of TLR4 to γ-PGA. Alterations in the expression profile of TLRs including TLR4 following norovirus infection was further investigated. TLR1-9 mRNA expression levels were not altered by more than 2-fold in MNV-1-infected RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 2f) . Neither norovirus infection nor γ-PGA treatment enhanced TLR4 expression. Immunoblotting analyses detected pIRF-3, indicating that both these stimuli activated TLR4 signaling as evidenced by the activation of IRF-3 (Fig. 2g) . Similarly, neither TLR3, a sensor for norovirus dsRNA 24 nor TLR2, which could be a potential innate immune sensor for not-yet-identified norovirus-derived or induced PAMPs, was upregulated by norovirus infection or γ-PGA. These results suggest that the antiviral activity of γ-PGA is not dependent on the upregulation of TLRs.Sensing of γ-PGA by TLR4 triggers induction of IFN-β in the small intestine of mouse. Norovirus consumed with contaminated food and/or water penetrates through intestinal microfold (M) cells and infects its target cells including macrophages and dendritic cells (for MNV) 25 or B cells (for HuNoV) 36 . After infection, norovirus propagates in these sentinel cells that are highly enriched in Peyer's patches (PPs) in the ileum, before spreading to lymph nodes 37, 38 .We thus sought to address the question of whether γ-PGA can trigger TLR4 signaling-mediated IFN production in the ileum (composed of epithelial cells plus diverse immune cells in the laminar propria and the PPs) to exert its antiviral activity against norovirus. To this end, distal part of the ileum with or without PPs was retrieved from BALB/c mice. These were treated with γ-PGA in culture dishes for 18 h ex vivo. After treatment, the villi released into the culture media and the remaining basal body of the ileum (ileal submucosa and lamina propria) were collected separately and the IFN-β mRNA levels were quantified in these ileal compartments by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (Fig. 3a) . Interestingly, we found induction of IFN-β production by γ-PGA only in the villi (compartments II and IV) and not in PPs and basal body of the ileum (compartments III and I) (Fig. 3b) . This induction was more substantial in the villi derived from the ileum with PPs (compartment II) than from the ileum without PPs (compartment IV). TLR4-stained cells were more abundant in compartment II than in compartment IV (Fig. 3c) . These results suggest that to activate TLR4 signaling, γ-PGA transverses the epithelial cell layer of the villi to reach the laminar propria bearing TLR4-positive macrophages and dendritic cells. Despite the abundance of TLR4-positive cells in PPs, γ-PGA treatment did not significantly induce IFN-β mRNA expression, suggesting non-responsiveness of PPs to γ-PGA by an as-yet-unknown mechanism.In a parallel experiment, the route of entry of MNV in the ileum was monitored. Fluorescence microscopic analysis of Q-dot-conjugated viruses detected MNV particles in compartment II. No prominent sign of virion entry was detected through the villi at the ileum without PPs (Fig. 3d) . These results demonstrate that MNV primarily enters into the ileum bearing PPs through intestinal villi, possibly via M cells or transepithelial dendritic cells. To confirm the entry of MNV through this part of the ileum, viral genome was monitored upon delivering Fig. 3a ), in agreement with our results showing MNV particles within villi. Consequently, enhanced IFN-β mRNA levels were detected in both ileal compartments while greater induction was observed in ileal PPs (iPPs) early during virus infection ( Supplementary Fig. 3b,c) , suggesting that MNV entering through villi reached to the PPs to infect ileal sentinel cells. These results are consistent with the previous findings indicating entry of norovirus through the M cells within the follicle-associated epithelium overlying PPs or in villi to infect macrophages and dendritic cells 37, 39, 40 .  Oral administration of γ-PGA induces production of IFN-β but not inflammatory cytokines in mice.  IFN-β-inducible activity of γ-PGA was further investigated in mice to ascertain the prophylactic antiviral efficacy of orally delivered γ-PGA. Initial experiments revealed production of both IFN-α and IFN-β at levels below the detection limits of ELISA at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h post-administration of γ-PGA (50 mg/kg body weight per day) to BALB/c mice ( Supplementary Fig. 4a,b) . These results suggest weak IFN-inducing activity or inefficient Q-dot (QD)-conjugated MNV-1, which was pre-incubated with 2,000-kDa γ-PGA (100 nM) for 30 min, was applied to RAW264.7 cells. Two hours after adsorption, viral entry was quantified by fluorescence microscopy (d), and the fluorescence intensity signals were quantified by image analysis using ImageJ software (e).

When γ-PGA (50 mg/kg body weight) was administered to mice, once a day for five days, serum IFN-β level increased starting from day 3 (Fig. 4a) . Induction of IFN-α was negligible ( Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 4b ). Production of IFN-β was induced by 2,000-kDa γ-PGA but not by 500-kDa γ-PGA ( Supplementary Fig. 4c,d) , suggesting the importance of its structural entity in activating TLR4 signaling. Furthermore, IFN-β levels (mean values) neither decreased nor increased from day 3 to day 5, indicating that multiple administrations of γ-PGA do not induce TLR4 tolerance to blunt the responsiveness to repetitive challenges with γ-PGA.Among the other cytokines analyzed, no significant change was detected in the levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α (Fig. 4c) . However, significant decrease was seen in the level of IL-1α and IL-1β at day 3 and 5, respectively. Level of IL-1α remained downregulated until day 5 indicating inverse correlation of its expression with IFN-β. These results are consistent with recent studies suggesting a negative regulatory role of IFN-β in the maturation of IL-1α/β 41, 42 . Type II interferon (IFN-γ) produced primarily by activated T cells was not detected in In vivo antiviral efficacy of γ-PGA against mouse norovirus. To test the antiviral activity of γ-PGA in vivo, MNV-1 (1 × 10 7 PFU per mouse) was orally inoculated into BALB/c mice that received γ-PGA (50 mg/ kg body weight) prior to infection once daily for five days to induce IFN-β expression. Two days after MNV inoculation, viral load in the ileum with PPs and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were quantified using RT-qPCR and plaque-forming assay. γ-PGA administration resulted in 47% and 53% reduction of MNV-1 genome titer in the ileum with PPs and MLNs, respectively (Fig. 5a) . Plaque-formation assay revealed 36% and 33% reduction of MNV titer in the ileum with PPs and MLNs, respectively (Fig. 5b) . These results indicate that peroral   Effect of norovirus infection on TLR expression in the small intestine of mouse.  Given the possibility of crosstalk between TLRs, if expression of TLRs in the ileum was altered in response to norovirus infection, TLR4 response to γ-PGA would also be affected. The ileum with PPs of norovirus-infected mice showed no significant increase in TLR4 expression. Expression levels of TLR2, TLR3, TLR6, TLR8, and TLR9 were slightly increased. Though the increase was less than 2-fold, it was statistically significant (Fig. 6a) . The expression of Figure 5 . γ-PGA inhibits MNV-1 in mice.

This might have contributed to the amplification of γ-PGA-mediated TLR4 signaling in vivo as several TLR downstream signaling pathways share transcription factors such as NF-κB and IRF-3 35 , used for type I IFN production. In MLNs, expression levels of TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, TLR7, and TLR8 were slightly decreased (less than 2-fold) (Fig. 6b) . These results suggest differentially altered TLR expression profile for norovirus infection in the ileum with PPs and MLNs in vivo. Interestingly, this expression profile of TLRs was different from that seen in virus-infected RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 2F) , suggesting the involvement of commensal microbiota in the regulation of TLR expression in the ileum, in the context of norovirus infection in mice.Thus, in the ileum with PPs, where villi responded to γ-PGA and induced IFN-β expression, level of TLR4 remained unchanged although expression of other TLRs was differentially affected by norovirus infection. It remains to be determined whether γ-PGA's antiviral activity against norovirus was potentiated by the amplification of TLR4 signaling through sensitization of other upregulated TLRs in the ileum upon norovirus infection.  Discussion  Type I IFN is the primary cytokine that is induced rapidly in response to viral infections. It amplifies immune responses through the IFN-signaling cascade 24, 25, 46 . However, its antiviral effect in the intestinal tract is less clear. In the present study, we investigated the ability of orally administered γ-PGA to induce an innate immune response and to mount an antiviral state in the ileum. Our results indicate induction of IFN-β production without elevating the level of proinflammatory cytokine by γ-PGA, a non-LPS TLR4 ligand, thereby predisposing the ileum to develop a robust antiviral innate immunity against norovirus.Our results demonstrate induction of type I IFN production primarily by the activation of TRIF-dependent pathway in mice following multiple peroral administration of γ-PGA. Previous studies have reported the primary activation of MyD88-dependent pathway by LPS in eliciting the secretion of numerous proinflammatory cytokines [1] [2] [3] [4] 8 . As a TLR4 ligand, γ-PGA is distinct from LPS in selectively increasing the serum IFN-β titers, but not of other inflammatory cytokines, namely IL-1α/β, IL-6, and TNF-α. This difference in the cytokine profile induced by γ-PGA and LPS suggests that a regulatory network different from that of LPS should control γ-PGA-mediated TLR4 activation. It remains unclear whether other non-LPS TLR4 ligands including endogenous TLR4 agonists such as heat shock proteins and cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides 8 upon being sensed by the same receptor also behave differently than LPS in terms of the cytokine profile. Another unexpected finding was that the elevated serum IFN-β levels in mice after multiple oral administrations of γ-PGA (once daily for three days) neither increased nor decreased following two additional oral administrations. These results suggest the absence of tolerance phenomena with γ-PGA, which is normally seen with endotoxin, or LPS, wherein, innate immune cells pre-exposed to LPS become refractory to subsequent challenges 47 . Based on the results of our present study, γ-PGA seems to be a new class of TLR4 agonists that selectively activates the TRIF-dependent pathway.IECs are normally non-responsive to TLR4 ligands such as LPS because of low-level expression of TLR4 receptors to prevent undesirable inflammation in response to gut microbiomes or pathogens in the GI tract. Minimal TLR4 expression was seen in normal IECs and the lamina propria rich in scattered inflammatory cells in human biopsies 48 . Although not thoroughly characterized, a previous study had indicated the expression of TLR4 as well as other TLRs (TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR5, and TLR9) in the enterocytes of small intestine 49 . By immunohistochemistry, we observed no prominent TLR4-staining patterns on apical or basolateral surfaces of IECs; TLR4-positive cells were instead localized in the lamina propria of villi and the PPs in the ileum. Thus, our results together with previous findings provide evidence of TLR4 expression in the ileum. However, its fine localization are yet to be well defined. Low but detectable level of TLR4 expression explains its role at the distal ileum that is continuously exposed to microbes and their products transferred from colon 50 . This renders the ileum or IECs hyposensitive to PAMPs including LPS and other TLR agonists, thereby preventing aberrant production of proinflammatory cytokines. In this regard, induction of IFN-β in ex vivo cultures of mouse ileum and in mice receiving γ-PGA perorally was surprising, particularly in the absence of upregulation of TLR4 expression by γ-PGA in RAW264.7 cells and in mouse ileum with PPs.TRIF-dependent pathway of TLR4 signaling is activated in endosomes upon internalization of TLR4-ligand complexes [1] [2] [3] [4] . Accordingly, in the present study, γ-PGA delivered orally seemed to be internalized into IECs or transverses the tight junctions between enterocytes to be internalized into the sentinel cells in the lamina propria to induce IFN-β production. Thus, we further investigated as to how γ-PGA reached a site where functional interaction with TLR4 occurred in the ileum. The first barrier for the entry of γ-PGA was the mucus layer, where access of γ-PGA to the small intestine is more likely to occur as it is covered by a thinner mucus layer compared to the colon 51 . For induction of IFN production, γ-PGA needs to be sensed by TLR4 in and/or on villi. Immunostaining revealed lack of overlapping between TLR4 staining and villin, a cytoskeletal protein specific to villi in the ileum, indicating a barely detectable level of TLR4 at the apical site of IECs. We therefore hypothesized a model in which γ-PGA transverses the tight junctions between enterocytes to be sensed by sentinel cells such as dendritic cells within villi or is directly uptaken by transepithelial dendrites (Supplementary Fig. 5) . Expression of IFN-β mRNA was significantly enhanced solely in the villi with lack of noticeable IFN-β induction in PPs. Absence of response to γ-PGA in PPs resulting in lack of inflammation was consistent with the previous findings suggesting anergy of intestinal macrophages. Anergy was mediated by their inability to activate NF-κB, and low-level expression of TLR4 and its accessory factors CD14 and MD2 52 .We previously showed that activation of TLR4 signaling by γ-PGA leading to induction of IFN was dependent on TLR4-associated accessary factors CD14 and MD2 6 . In the present study, results from Q-dot-conjugated γ-PGA confirm the necessity of CD14 and MD2 for sensing γ-PGA. Dependence on CD14 in MyD88-dependent pathway-mediated induction of TNF-α was marginal in LPS-stimulated macrophages 53, 54 . However, our results indicate the absolute requirement of CD14 and its prominent role over MD2 in sensing γ-PGA. Our findings suggesting Scientific RePORTS | (2018) 8:8667 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-26935-y a substantial stimulatory effect of γ-PGA in the lamina propria raises interest on the possibility of differential expression of MD2, CD14, and TLR4 in macrophages and dendritic cells in the lamina propria and PPs. Currently, requirement of these accessory factors in sensing various non-LPS TLR4 ligands remains largely unknown. Irrespective of the mechanisms involved in γ-PGA entry and sensing by TLR4-positive cells in the ileum, both, results from ex vivo culture indicating stimulation of the ileum with γ-PGA and the serum cytokine profile of mice receiving peroral γ-PGA, provide clues as to how γ-PGA activates the TRIF-dependent TLR4 signaling pathway in the ileum.We further investigated the impact of norovirus infection on TLR4-mediated induction of IFN-β by γ-PGA. Our results suggest lack of significant alteration of TLR4 expression in norovirus-infected mice. Thus, responsiveness of TLR4 to γ-PGA was unlikely to be elevated upon norovirus infection. However, norovirus infection led to a ~2-fold increase in the expression of most TLRs, except TLR4 and TLR6 (Fig. 6a) . TLR1 level was increased ~5-fold. Upregulated TLR expression could be in part due to the infiltration of leukocytes to the infected ileum. We envision that TLR4 signaling activation by γ-PGA might be potentiated through crosstalks with other upregulated TLRs. Among the upregulated TLRs, the endosomal TLRs including TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 may influence the sensitivity of TLR4 to γ-PGA early during norovirus infection. Currently, their involvement (except TLR3) in innate immune response to norovirus infection remains unknown 24, 55 . Although norovirus infection did not affect the expression of TLR4 in the ileum, TLR responses to colon-resident microbiota and/or PAMPs derived from them might influence the downstream cascade of TLR4 signaling. Thus, induction of IFN-β by γ-PGA is likely to be modulated by commensal microbiome in the large intestine adjacent to the ileum.Type I IFN plays a major role in clearing mouse norovirus [24] [25] [26] . It is effective in limiting norovirus replication in human norovirus sub-genomic replicon culture system 17 . In spite of the well-established antiviral potency of type I IFN against noroviruses, IFN therapy is not translated into clinical practice because subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of IFN-α/β is associated with various side effects 56, 57 . Our results, demonstrating the prophylactic antiviral activity of γ-PGA in mice using MNV-1 as a model for enteric viruses infecting the small intestine, accentuates its potential use as a safe and prophylactic candidate for the treatment of acute norovirus infection. Although norovirus infection is typically limited to an acute infection that lasts for 2-3 days in most healthy subjects 58 , it is associated with significant clinical outcomes with ~200,000 deaths related with gastroenteritis in children under 5 years of age 59 . In young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients for whom IFN might not be the best treatment option, γ-PGA can be used as an alternative prophylactic antiviral agent for HuNoV. It is important to note that unlike the MNV replicating mainly in macrophages and dendritic cells 25 , HuNoV, which was shown to replicate in B cells 36 , also targets IECs [60] [61] [62] . Therefore, the IFN produced by the sentinel cells in the lamina propria of villi upon sending the γ-PGA might restrict HuNoV infection more effectively at the early stage of infection by acting on nearby IECs through paracrine signaling.In summary, our results demonstrate that oral administration of γ-PGA induces IFN-β production in the ileum without upregulating the expression of TLR4 and without eliciting the production of inflammatory cytokines. The specific IFN-β induction feature of γ-PGA highlights its potential application as a prophylactic antiviral agent for noroviruses and possibly other enteric viruses.  Methods  Cell culture. The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and human embryonic kidney 293 T (HEK293T) cell line were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville, MD, USA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. The HG23 cell line stably harboring a HuNoV (Norwalk virus) replicon 17 was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids in the presence of 1 mg/ml neomycin (G418 sulfate). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 humidified incubator.  Reagents and transfection.  Endotoxin-free γ-PGAs with different average molecular masses (500and 2,000-kDa), which were prepared as described previously 60 , were provided by BioLeaders (Daejeon, Korea). The plasmids expressing human TLR4, CD14, and MD2 were described 61, 62 Following washing, infected cells were further cultivated in fresh complete media for 2 days. Viral stock was prepared by centrifuging harvested media at 450 × g for 10 min. Intracellular virus particles recovered by three freeze/thaw cycles were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min. Virus samples were then concentrated using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter unit with a molecular weight cutoff of 50 kDa (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and stored at −80 °C until further use as crude MNV preparation. Purification of MNV was performed as previously described with modifications 65 . Briefly, crude MNV was pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was gently suspended in a suspension buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl) at 4 °C and pelleted again by ultracentrifugation. The resultant pellet was dissolved in suspension buffer and was subjected to sucrose density gradient (10-60%) centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 150 min at 4 °C to collect the MNV-containing fractions that were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by immunoblotting for the VP1 capsid protein. The fractions were subjected to ultracentrifugation as described above to obtain purified virus particles. These purified virus particles were suspended in PBS and used for virus entry experiments.Plaque-forming assay. Plaque-forming assay was performed as described previously 66 . Briefly, RAW264.7 cells seeded in 6-well plates (2 × 10 6 cells/well) were cultured overnight and infected with norovirus in serum-free DMEM. After 1 h of infection, cells were washed to remove the inoculum and were overlaid by SeaPlaque Agarose (1% w/v; Lonza, Rockland, ME, USA) in complete DMEM with high glucose. Following 2 or 3 days of culture, plaques were visualized by staining the monolayer cells with neutral red.Cell viability. RAW264.7 cells seeded in 96-well plates (2 × 10 4 cells/well) were grown overnight and treated with various concentrations of γ-PGA for 48 h. Cell viability was assessed by an MTS [3-(4,5-dimet hylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay as described previously 67 .RNA extraction and RT-qPCR. For total RNA extraction from mouse ileum, three pieces (1-cm-long segment) of the ileum with Peyer's patches (~3-mm each in length) were retrieved from the distal ileum (distal 1/3 part of the ileum), opened, cleaned by washing with PBS to remove fecal matter, and homogenized in 1-ml PBS. Similarly, total RNA was recovered from MLNs. Total RNA from cells or culture media was extracted with TRIzol or TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), respectively. Norwalk virus and MNV-1 RNA copy number was determined by RT-qPCR as described previously 68, 69 . Quantification of mRNA was carried out by RT-qPCR using SYBR Premix ExTaq (Takara, Japan). The specific primer sets used are listed in Supplementary  Table 1 . Specific primers for human IFN-β and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were as described previously 70 . The expression levels of all the target genes normalized with the expression level of GAPDH mRNA were quantified using the ΔΔC t method 71 .Immunoblot analyses. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics) by incubating on ice for 20 min. Aliquots of cleared cell lysates from the same samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and processed in parallel for immunoblotting analyses for multiple proteins. Membranes were immunoblotted with specific antibodies and the bound antibodies were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Analyses of cellular entry of γ-PGA and MNV. For microscopic analysis, both, γ-PGA and purified MNV were conjugated with biotin on the exposed amine group using Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (EZ-Link; Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Biotinylated γ-PGA and MNV-1 were detected using Qdot 625 streptavidin conjugate (Invitrogen).  Transmission electron microscopy.  Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Intestinal tissues of mice were embedded in a frozen section compound (Surgipath FSC22, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Thin sections (10 µm) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked in 1% BSA in PBS, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with an anti-TLR4 mouse monoclonal antibody or an anti-villin rabbit polyclonal antibody with gentle rocking. After washing 3 times with PBS, appropriate fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies were used for visualizing the antigen. Nuclei were visualized by staining with 1 μM 4′,6′-diaamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS for 10 min. Confocal images were acquired on a ZEISS LSM 880 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). For z-stack analysis, images were obtained along the z-axis at 0.3-μm intervals and subjected to three-dimensional analysis using ZEN software (Blue edition, 2.3, Carl Zeiss).Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The serum levels of IFN-α and β were measured using the VeriKine mouse IFN-α and β ELISA kit (PBL Interferon Source, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The detection limit of mouse IFN-α and β ELISAs were 12.5 and 15.6 pg/ml, respectively. Serum levels of other cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) were quantified using Luminex multiplex detection assay using antibody-coated magnetic beads (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).Ex vivo culture of small intestinal tissues of mouse. For ex vivo culture of small intestinal tissues of mouse, ileum was isolated and cultured as described previously 72 with slight modifications. Briefly, distal ileum segments (1 cm in length) with or without Peyer's patches were collected, gently opened with a sterilized operating scissors, washed five times with PBS supplemented with 10% penicillin/streptomycin, and transferred to 12-well plates for further incubation in complete DMEM. In vivo antiviral activity of γ-PGA. BALB/c mice (6 weeks old, n = 10 per group) were orally administered with γ-PGA in 100-µl saline once a day for 1, 3, or 5 days at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight. Four hours after the last γ-PGA administration, total blood was collected from the abdominal vein of mice for cytokine analyses using ELISA. To test the antiviral efficacy of γ-PGA, BALB/c mice (6 weeks old, n = 7 per group) were orally administered with γ-PGA (50 mg/kg body weight) in 100 µl saline once a day for 5 days. This was followed by peroral inoculation with MNV (1 × 10 7 PFU/100 µL saline) 12 h after the last γ-PGA administration at day 5. γ-PGA was given once daily for another two days. Two days after inoculation, the distal ileum and MLNs were retrieved from mice for analyses of intracellular viral RNA and infectious virus titers. Homogenized tissues were subjected to centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min to recover supernatants, which were then passed through a 0.20-µm pore-size membrane filter. The filtrates were used for quantification of virus titers using a plaque-forming assay. Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6 (Graphpad Prism Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (s.d) from at least three independent experiments, unless otherwise stated. Specific tests used to determine statistical difference are noted in each figure legend. Differences between groups were considered statistically significant if *P < 0.05.  Data availability.

29912695	Detection of Respiratory Viruses in Deceased Persons, Spain, 2017	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6038767/	During the 2016–17 influenza season in Spain, we tested specimens from 57 elderly deceased persons for respiratory viruses. Influenza viruses were detected in 18% of the specimens and any respiratory virus in 47%. Only 7% of participants had received a diagnosis of infection with the detected virus before death.	  I ncreases in all-cause deaths usually occur during annual influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) epidemics (1, 2) . This excess is higher in seasons dominated by influenza virus A(H3N2) (3, 4) . Ecologic design approaches have been used to estimate deaths caused by influenza and other respiratory viruses on the basis of weekly virus surveillance data (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . Because a small proportion of persons are tested for influenza virus before death (6) , the actual contribution of influenza to all-cause mortality is not well known. Other respiratory viruses are responsible for some influenza-like illnesses and related deaths (7) and have been related to deaths of unknown cause (8) . We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of detecting influenza and other respiratory viruses in recently deceased persons and of estimating the prevalence of infections in persons who died within an influenza epidemic period.  The Study  We performed this study in Navarre, Spain, during January 23-February 19, 2017, during the seasonal influenza epidemic (9). Recruitment was conducted in 2 morgues by trained professionals. Persons >65 years of age who had died of natural causes regardless of the reported cause of death were included, after we obtained written in-formed consent from their closest relatives. We obtained nasopharyngeal swab specimens before the bodies were prepared for burial; we tested the swabs for influenza and RSV by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). We tested negative samples for other respiratory viruses using multiple PCR (Allplex Respiratory Panel; Seegene, Seoul, South Korea).We obtained demographic information and previous diagnoses from the epidemiologic surveillance system. We retrieved hospitalization and laboratory confirmation for respiratory viruses within the 30 days before the death from electronic healthcare databases. We obtained the underlying causes of death from the regional mortality register and grouped them into 5 categories according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision: neoplasms (codes C00-D49), nervous system diseases (codes G00-G99), circulatory system diseases (codes I00-I99), respiratory system diseases (codes J00-J99), and all other causes. We used the 2-tailed Fisher exact test to compare proportions.The study period included the last 4 weeks of the 2016-17 influenza epidemic in Navarre, starting 2 weeks after the peak. This period was characterized by a high but descending number of hospitalizations of patients with laboratoryconfirmed influenza and 27% excess in all-cause mortality (online Technical Appendix Figure, https://wwwnc. cdc.gov/EID/article/24/7/18-0162-Techapp1.pdf).During the study period, 460 deceased persons >65 years of age were registered, 106 were attended in the participating morgues, and 57 (54%) were enrolled in the study. Nonparticipation resulted mainly from logistic problems and lack of signed consent.Of the 57 participants in the study, 29 (51%) were women, 23 (40%) were <85 years of age, 50 (88%) had major chronic conditions, 5 (9%) had been resident in nursing homes, and only 12 (21%) had been hospitalized before death. Nonparticipants did not differ in these characteristics (online Technical Appendix Table) .Respiratory viruses were detected in the postmortem study in 27 (47%) participants, but only 4 (7%) had received this diagnosis before death ( Figure 1 ). Ten (18%) participants tested positive for influenza virus A(H3N2), 7 (12%) for RSV (4 subgroup A and 3 subgroup B), 7 (12%) for coronavirus (6 type 229E and 1 type OC43), and 4 (7%) for rhinovirus. Although postmortem detection of any respiratory virus was more likely among previously hospitalized persons, it was also frequent among those not hospitalized (75% vs. 40%; p = 0.050) (Table) .The postmortem detection of influenza or other respiratory viruses was not statistically associated with the analyzed covariates, with 2 exceptions: respiratory viruses other than influenza were detected more frequently in deceased men (46%; 13/28) than in women (14%; 4/29; p = 0.010), and respiratory viruses were more frequently detected among deceased persons who were reported with respiratory system diseases as the underlying cause of death than in those reported with other causes (86% vs. 42%; p = 0.045) (Table) . Nevertheless, the percentage of deceased persons whose specimens tested positive for any respiratory virus was notable in all groups of nonrespiratory causes of death (range 38%-50%) (Table; Figure 2 ). Only 1 person (10%) whose specimen was detected as having influenza virus in the postmortem test had influenza registered as the cause of death; 5 (50%) were registered as having a cardiorespiratory cause of death.  Conclusions  This study demonstrates the feasibility of the detection of respiratory viruses in samples from deceased persons. Respiratory viruses were found in nearly half of the persons who died of natural causes in an influenza epidemic period, and 18% were confirmed for influenza virus A(H3N2), which was the same influenza virus subtype that dominated in patients during the 2016-17 season (10, 11) . The 2016-17 influenza season was characterized in Europe by an increase in deaths (2) . Other respiratory viruses were detected during the influenza circulation period and may have contributed substantially to hospitalizations and deaths (1, 5, 12) . RT-PCR seems to have high sensitivity for the detection of respiratory viruses in deceased persons, as previously shown in studies based on coronial autopsies (8, 13) .Respiratory virus infections are characterized by sudden onset; death may occur suddenly, even before the symptoms are evident. Respiratory viruses can trigger secondary bacterial infections or exacerbate existing chronic conditions, and these concurrent conditions usually prevail as the underlying cause of death. Half of the deaths with influenza virus detection in the postmortem test were registered as having a noncardiorespiratory cause of death, which is consistent with a previous hospital study (6) . This finding demonstrates the difficulty in estimating the deaths related to respiratory viruses by using the mortality registers. These results raise relevant implications. Only a small proportion of deceased persons whose respiratory virus was detected in the postmortem test had been hospitalized and received this diagnosis before dying; therefore, the contribution of viral infections to death may be underestimated. Deaths related to respiratory viruses could be distributed among all causes of death. Although the burden of death has been estimated by indirect approaches (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) , this study offers a complementary novel approach to assess the impact in terms of the proportion of all-cause deaths with respiratory virus detection (14) .The surveillance of influenza based on laboratory-confirmed cases is implemented in primary healthcare and in hospitalized patients (9, 11) . Our results open the possibility and show the potential interest of adding a sentinel virological surveillance based on persons who die during the influenza season.Caution should be paid in the interpretation of these results, however. Virus detection does not necessarily imply a causal relationship between virus infection and death because respiratory viral shedding has been described in asymptomatic persons (15) . Our study included 12% of deaths in the region during the last 4 weeks of the influenza epidemic, but the peak was not included; therefore, the representativeness is limited. Similar characteristics of participants and nonparticipants rule out selection bias. We cannot rule out false-negative results, however, because samples were obtained postmortem and the time from symptom onset to swabbing was unknown. Only negative samples for influenza and RSV were tested for other respiratory viruses, which might underestimate the frequency of the other respiratory codetections.In summary, we demonstrate the feasibility of detecting respiratory viruses in recently deceased persons. We frequently detected respiratory viruses postmortem in winter deaths, although most of these infections were not clinically diagnosed. Respiratory virus surveillance systems could be complemented by testing persons who die during the influenza circulation period for respiratory virus infections.   				1				
30753318	Type I interferon protects neurons from prions in in vivo models	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6439327/	Infectious prions comprising abnormal prion protein, which is produced by structural conversion of normal prion protein, are responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. Prions are infectious agents that do not possess a genome and the pathogenic protein was not thought to evoke any immune response. Although we previously reported that interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of prion diseases, suggesting the protective role of host innate immune responses mediated by IRF3 signalling, this remained to be clarified. Here, we investigated the reciprocal interactions of type I interferon evoked by IRF3 activation and prion infection and found that infecting prions cause the suppression of endogenous interferon expression. Conversely, treatment with recombinant interferons in an ex vivo model was able to inhibit prion infection. In addition, cells and mice deficient in type I interferon receptor (subunit interferon alpha/beta receptor 1), exhibited higher susceptibility to 22L-prion infection. Moreover, in in vivo and ex vivo prion-infected models, treatment with RO8191, a selective type I interferon receptor agonist, inhibited prion invasion and prolonged the survival period of infected mice. Taken together, these data indicated that the interferon signalling interferes with prion propagation and some interferon-stimulated genes might play protective roles in the brain. These findings may allow for the development of new strategies to combat fatal diseases.				1		1			
30868985	Spatiotemporal distribution of a non-haematophagous bat community and rabies virus circulation: a proposal for urban rabies surveillance in Brazil	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6518535/	In Brazil, rabies surveillance is based on monitoring domestic and wild animals, although the most prevalent lineage of the rabies virus (RABV) currently diagnosed in Brazil is associated with bats, particularly non-haematophagous bats. Disease control is based on the mass vaccination of dogs and cats. We used data collected by the passive surveillance system of the city of Campinas from 2011 to 2015, to describe the temporal and geographic distributions of the bat specimens and RABV and discuss the current rabies surveillance with the advent of the declaration of canine and feline rabies-free areas in Brazil. We described the species, locations and health statuses of the collected bat specimens. Moreover, all samples were submitted for RABV diagnosis. Then, we performed a time series decomposition for each bat family. Additionally, we determined the spatiotemporal relative risk for RABV infection using the ratio of the kernel-smoothed estimates of spatiotemporal densities of RABV-positive and RABV-negative bats. From the 2537 bat specimens, the most numerous family was Molossidae (72%), followed by Vespertilionidae (14%) and Phyllostomidae (13%). The bat families behaved differently in terms of seasonal and spatial patterns. The distribution of bats varied geographically in the urban environment, with Molossidae and Phyllostomidae being observed downtown and Vespertilionidae being observed in peripheral zones. Concurrently, a significant relative risk of RABV infection was observed downtown for Vespertilionidae and in peripheral zones for Molossidae. No RABV-positive sample clusters were observed. As a result of the official declaration of RABV-free areas in southern Brazil, mass dog and cat vaccinations are expected to halt in the near future. This stoppage would make most dog and cat populations susceptible to other RABV lineages, such as those maintained by non-haematophagous bats. In this scenario, all information available on bats and RABV distribution in urban areas is essential. Currently, few studies have been conducted. Some local health authorities, such as that in Campinas, are spontaneously basing their surveillance efforts on bat rabies, which is the alternative in reality scenario of increased susceptibility to bat-associated RABV that is developing in Brazil.	  Although the most prevalent lineages of RABV currently diagnosed in Brazil are associated with bats, specifically nonhaematophagous bats [11, 13] , the national-level human rabies surveillance and control remain based on the transmission of AgV1 and AgV2, both of which are associated with carnivores, mostly dogs and cats. The rabies surveillance system performed by local health authorities is based on monitoring the occurrence of rabies in domestic animals by surveilling deceased and euthanised dogs showing neurological symptoms in public shelters, until the sample reaches 0.2% of the estimated dog population [14, 15] . Rabies control is based on the mass vaccination of at least 80% of the estimated dog and cat populations, clinical observation of dogs and cats that bite a human for at least 10 days after the attack, post-exposure vaccination for the attack victims and emergency vaccination of all unvaccinated dogs and cats within a 5 km buffer area around a suspicious case [14, 15] . This effort resulted in a declining trend of human rabies, with few cases remaining in north and northeast Brazil yearly.Campinas, located 96 km northwest of Sao Paulo City, is one of the largest cities in Brazil, with ∼1 million inhabitants [16] . The city can be considered as a case study for rabies surveillance and control for the rest of Brazil. Campinas has an Animal Control Authority (UVZ) that has been in place since 1972, when mass dog and cat vaccination campaigns started. In 2009, 90 085 dogs and 9001 cats were vaccinated against RABV [15] . In 2010, the mass vaccination campaign was halted because of vaccine accidents, followed by a reduction in the delivery of rabies vaccines for dogs and cats from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. At that moment, only emergency vaccinations of dogs and cats inside a buffer area of 5 km (i.e. blockage area) around suspicious or confirmed dog or cat rabies cases could be performed. The mass vaccination campaigns resumed in 2012, were interrupted in 2015, and resumed again in 2016. However, after these changes, two cats and a dog with rabies demonstrated to be bat variant rabies [17] .Although the UVZ historically focused on rabies control by the mass vaccination of dogs and cats against RABV, a passive surveillance system for bats was implemented in 1994. Reports of bat presence are received through a call centre, and the UVZ staff goes immediately to the location and collects dead or alive bat specimens and sends them for RABV diagnosis. The number of notifications increased slowly until 2010, when 488 bats were captured [15] . Since then, a mean number of 536 bats were retrieved from Campinas households yearly (personal communication).Unlike the other Brazilian cities, in Campinas when a bat from the passive surveillance system is diagnosed with RABV, house-to-house communication and distribution of educational material (including the call centre number for further notifications) begin immediately in the area in which the positive bat was found. During these visits, the number of unvaccinated dogs and cats are recorded and their owners are encouraged to vaccinate them.Currently, the probability of bat-associated RABV to be transmitted from bats to dogs and cats and then to humans is higher than that of carnivore-associated RABV (AgV1 and AgV2) to be transmitted from dogs and cats to humans in Brazil. Therefore, if the vaccine protection declines with the declaration of AgV1-and AgV2-free areas in Southern Brazil in 2015, dogs and cats will become susceptible to bat-associated RABV. Few studies described bat communities in urban areas [18, 19] , with some studies describing the effects of city lights [20] and lead poisoning [21] over bats in urban areas. In South America, a single study aimed at the description of bat communities in urban areas of Chile [22] , and two Brazilian studies aimed at the investigation of Candida sp. [23] and Leptospira spp. [24] . The aim of this study was to describe the bat community and RABV distributions from data collected by the Campinas passive surveillance system from 2011 to 2015 to elucidate key points regarding the rabies surveillance in a future scenario of dogs and cats susceptibility to bat-associated RABV.  Materials and methods  Bat passive surveillance databaseThe study region was the city of Campinas, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The city has a bat rabies passive surveillance system in place which collects all dead and alive bats found in the households. Data from the UVZ bat rabies passive surveillance were compiled from 2011 to 2015 and included the species, address, geographic coordinates, date, location of the bat (inside, outside the building or household) and health status (dead or alive) of the bats. The UVZ staff identified the bat species, and the identification was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute of Sao Paulo, to which the specimens were sent for RABV diagnosis. Bats were submitted to a direct immunofluorescence test and RABV antigenic analysis. The RABV qualitative results (positive and negative) were kindly made available for this work. The proportions of RABV-positive samples and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) in each bat family were calculated using prop.test( ) function of R.The UVZ only began only to compile information about bats that directly or indirectly contacted dogs and cats in 2015. However, this type of record was not available when bats were found in the street or public areas. Since 2011, three rabies cases were recorded in Campinas: a cat infected with the Nyctinomops sp. RABV lineage in 2014; a dog infected with the Desmodus rotundus lineage (AgV3) in 2015; and a cat infected with the Myotis sp. lineage in 2016 [17] . All reported data had their geographic coordinates associated, which allowed locating them on thematic maps and perform spatial analyses.  General description of the collected bat specimens  For each bat family, genus and species, the general characteristics (sex, reproductive status) and the circumstances in which the specimens were found (capture place and health status) were described in proportions. The reproductive status (mature or immature) was defined by the presence of testes in males and mammary glands and nipples in the subaxillary region in females [25] . In order to describe the bat traits, first we compared the proportions of each variable between the bat families and then across the genera within each family using the prop.test( ) function of R.The list of bat species collected during the study period by the Campinas UVZ was compared with the Integrated Taxonomic Information System database (itis.gov) to verify their worldwide occurrence. The areas of occurrence of all species were verified in the SpeciesLink Network database (splink.org.br), which is a database of Brazilian animals and plants deposited in 456 collections worldwide, to verify that the collected bat specimens were likely to be found in Campinas.The biological features (size, weight, colony size, feeding habits, reproduction and roost type) of the bat species collected during the study period and those not collected but likely to be found in Campinas were compiled from the available literature [5, [26] [27] [28] [29] .During the study period, the Campinas UVZ collected 2537 bat specimens of 25 different species in 16 genera (Cynomops, Eumops, Molossops, Molossus, Nyctinomops, Promops, Tadarida, Artibeus, Glossophaga, Phyllostomus, Platyrrhinus, Sturnira, Eptesicus, Histiotus, Lasiurus and Myotis) and three families (Molossidae, Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae) ( Table 1) . With 1835 collected specimens (72%), Molossidae was the most numerous family, followed by Vespertilionidae (n = 348 or 14%) and Phyllostomidae (n = 325 or 13%). A few specimens (n = 29 or 1%) were not identified. The most numerous species (n > 100) were M. molossus (n = 873), C. planirostris (n = 175), E. glaucinus (n = 146), T. brasiliensis (n = 140) and G. soricina (n = 109).Most of the specimens were male (52%), and similar proportions of genera were observed between families, although among Molossidae, a higher proportion of females were observed in Eumops (48%; P = 0.02) and Tadarida (55%; P = 0.001) than in Molossus (40%). For the reproductive status, most of the specimens were mature (69%), but the proportions of immature of Molossidae (18%; P < 0.001) and Vespertilionidae (29%; P < 0.001) was significantly higher than that of Phyllostomidae (8%). With the Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae families, similar proportions of reproductive statuses were observed among genera, but within Molossidae, the proportion of immature Cynomops (28%) was higher than that of Eumops (15%; P < 0.001), Molossus (20%; P = 0.005), Nyctinomops (9%; P = 0.004) and Tadarida (11%; P < 0.001), and the proportion of immature Molossus was higher than that of Tadarida (P = 0.01).Forty-three percent of the total specimens were captured inside households, but Phyllostomidae (33%; P < 0.001) and Vespertilionidae (38%; P < 0.001) were more frequently captured outside the households than Molossidae (46%). Within Molossidae, Nyctinomops (66%) were more frequently captured inside households than Cynomops (42%; P = 0.003), Eumops (41%; P < 0.001) and Molossus (43%; P < 0.001), and Tadarida (76%) were more frequently captured inside households than Cynomops (P < 0.001), Eumops (P < 0.001) and Molossus (P < 0.001). Within Phyllostomidae, Glossophaga (49%; P < 0.001) and Platyrrhinus (52%; P < 0.001) were more frequently captured inside households than Artibeus (17%). Similar proportions of reproductive statuses were observed among the different genera of Vespertilionidae.Concerning the health status, most of the specimens were captured alive (52%). Nevertheless, Phyllostomidae (63%) were more frequently captured dead than Molossidae (36%; P < 0.001) and Vespertilionidae (49%; P < 0.001), and Vespertilionidae were more frequently captured dead than Molossidae (P < 0.001). Within Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae, similar proportions of health statuses were observed among genera, but within Molossidae, Cynomops (43%) were more frequently captured dead than Eumops (32%; P = 0.01), Molossus (36%; P = 0.04), Nyctinomops (24%; P = 0.003) and Tadarida (17%; P < 0.001). Eumops were more frequently captured dead than Tadarida (P = 0.001), and Molossus were more frequently captured dead than Nyctinomops (P = 0.03) and Tadarida (P < 0.001).For the RABV diagnosis (Table 2 ), only 45 specimens tested positive (1.8%; 95% CI 1.3%-2.4%; Table 2 ). The proportions of positive samples of Phyllostomidae (6.5%; 95% CI 4%-9.7%) and Vespertilionidae (4%; 95% CI 2.2%-6.7%) were similar but higher than that in Molossidae (0.5%; 95% CI 0.3%-1%). Molossops Vespertilionidae 147 (42) 171 (49) 30 (9) 101 (29) 207 (59) 40 (12) 133 (38) 143 (41) 72 (21) 169 (49) 143 (41) 36 (10) 348Eptesicus brasiliensis 2 (67)   Temporal distribution of collected bat specimens  The time series for each bat family time series was decomposed to determine the existence of seasonal or trend patterns during the study period. The seasonality period was detected via periodogram analysis, using Fournier transformation in the TSA package of R. We have chosen the additive model because the magnitude of the seasonal component was stable in the time series and used the decompose( ) function.  Spatiotemporal analysis of collected bat specimens and RABV  Regardless of the RABV laboratory results, the geographic distribution of Cynomops planirostris, Eumops glaucinus, Molossus molossus, Tadarida brasiliensis, Artibeus lituratus, Glossophaga soricina, Eptesicus spp. and Myotis spp., each with more than 100 collected specimens during the study period were represented in thematic maps, using QGIS software. Eptesicus spp. and Myotis spp. were grouped due to their similar traits for this geographic representation. Additionally, using the distribution of bat specimens, a kernel-smoothing with a 10 km bandwidth radius was performed using the Heat Map plugin of QGIS, and contour lines were extracted using the Extraction plugin of QGIS. This bandwidth was chosen due to the maximum foraging distance of frugivorous and haematophagous bats [26] .In order to verify the existence of clustering of RABV-positive samples, the generalisation of the Ripley's K function for bivariate spatial point processes, or the difference between the cumulative distribution functions of distances from random points to nearest RABV-positive and RABV-negative samples was calculated using the splancs package of R. Moreover, an envelope of the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the difference function was estimated from 999 Monte Carlo simulations. RABV-positive sample clusters were identified when the difference function crossed the positive values of its associated envelope [30] . The analysis was made for the species and genera with more than 100 collected specimens (described above).The Campinas urban zoning map [31] was used to stratify the locations of the collected specimens into five land uses: residential, commercial, industrial, protected area (forest fragments) and rural area. The residential strata were subdivided into residential (unifamiliar households) and apartments (multifamiliar buildings). The proportions of bat species or genera with more than 100 collected specimens (described above) in each urban zoning stratum were compared using the prop.test( ) function of R.The spatiotemporal relative risk for RABV infection was obtained by the ratio of the kernel-smoothed estimates of spatiotemporal densities of RABV-positive and RABV-negative bats in February (mid-summer), May (mid-autumn), August (midwinter) and November (mid-spring) using the sparr package of R [32] . Data from the different years were stratified by months and the density ratio was calculated using the spattemp.density ( ) function considering a fixed bandwidth kernel estimate of the continuous spatiotemporal data. The asymptotic tolerance contours (P = 0.05 and P = 0.001) were obtained to identify significantly increased relative risk areas.  Epidemiology and Infection  RABV-positive samples were found in only six genera, with the highest proportion observed in Artibeus (15.3%), followed by Myotis (5.7%), Eptesicus (4%), Tadarida (3.6%), Nyctinomops (1.9%) and Molossus (0.4%). A total of 90 samples (3.5%) could not be submitted for RABV diagnosis and were designated bad samples, but when possible, features such as bat species, general characteristics and circumstances in which the specimens have been found were used in the analysis. Table 3 presents a compilation of biological features of the bat species collected and those likely to occur in Campinas. Phyllostomidae have a longer forearm length and are heavier than Molossidae and Vespertilionidae. Molossidae and Vespertilionidae have a strict diet (general insectivores and aerial insectivores, respectively), whereas Phyllostomidae have a generalist diet (from insectivore, to frugivore, nectivore, pollinator, carnivore and flower eaters). Phyllostomidae have a more homogenous reproductive pattern (mostly poliestric) and fewer progeny (in general, one pup), whereas Molossidae and Vespertilionidae have diverse reproductive patterns (monoestric and poliestric), with Vespertilionidae producing more progeny (greater than two pups, in general). Molossidae and Vespertilionidae have higher proportions of species that can use artificial roosts (87% and 83%, respectively) than Phyllostomidae (58%). Moreover, some species of Molossidae and Vespertilionidae cohabit with different species in the same roosts.  Temporal distribution of the collected bat specimens  The seasonal period for the bat records was 1 year according to the periodogram analysis. However, the peaks of Molossidae and Vespertilionidae findings were observed during summer that of Phyllostomidae was observed during winter (Fig. 1) . Even though a trend of increased bat records from 2012 and 2013 in all families has been observed, the bat findings were considered stable throughout the time series.  Spatiotemporal analysis of the collected bat specimens and RABV  Based on the biological features of each collected bat species and those likely to occur in Campinas (Table 3) , specimens identified as Tadarida sp. were considered T. brasiliensis, those as Glossophaga sp. were considered G. soricina and species from the genera Epitesicus (including Epitesicus sp.) and Myotis (including Myotis sp.) were combined. Therefore, six bat species and two genera are represented in thematic maps: C. planirostris, E. glaucinus, M. molossus, T. brasiliensis, A. lituratus, G. soricina, Eptesicus spp. and Myotis spp. A. lituratus was included because this species had the highest RABV prevalence, although the number of collected specimens was below 100. Nyctinomops was the only genus with RABV-positive bats (n = 1) not represented geographically. The bat specimen density maps are presented in Figure 2a .The highest density was observed for M. molossus (up to 687 specimens per km 2 ), and the lowest densities were observed for G. soricina and Eptesicus spp. (up to 20 specimens per km 2 ). In general, the highest density of specimens was obtained at or close to downtown except for Eptesicus spp. and Myotis spp., which were more frequently observed in the urban-rural interface area of Campinas. For families, the highest density of collected specimens of Molossidae and Phyllostomidae was observed downtown, with Vespertilionidae being observed most frequently in the Table 1 . northwest region of Campinas in the urban-rural interface zone (Fig. 2b) . The distributions of RABV-positive and RABV-negative samples are also shown in Figures 2a and 2b . In general, no cluster of positive samples was observed within small distances. For A. lituratus the empirical K function only barely exceeds the envelope at ∼2 km and otherwise remains within the envelope. For Eptesicus spp., the empirical K function is only outside the envelope from ∼2 to 2.5 km and from 5.75 to 8 km (Fig. 3) .Most of the bats were collected in residential areas (64.2%), in contrast to T. brasiliensis (52.9%), which were collected mostly in protected areas (parks and forests) ( Table 4 ) close to downtown.The bat families behaved differently in terms of their seasonal and spatial patterns (Fig. 4) . Spatiotemporal analysis showed that in Molossidae, a significant excess of relative risk of rabies positivity (P < 0.05) was observed in peripheral areas, in the western region from autumn to winter and in the eastern region of Campinas from winter to spring. During summer, a small area of relative risk excess was observed in the northern region of the city. For Phyllostomidae, a significant excess of relative risk (P < 0.05) was observed downtown throughout the year, which intensified during autumn (P < 0.001). Moreover, from autumn to winter, an excess of relative risk (P < 0.05) was also observed in peripheral zones of northern and southern areas of Campinas. Finally, Vespertilionidae showed a more stable area of significant relative risk excess (P < 0.05) throughout the year at downtown, which intensified from winter to spring (P < 0.001).  Discussion  The current work was based on records of a passive bat rabies surveillance system in the city of Campinas, Brazil. The findings showed that bat family densities varied in space and time. Moreover, due to the location and situation at which bats were collected, the risk of RABV transmission to domestic animals and humans was high, as recent reports of two cats and a dog infected with bat-associated RABV shown. The bat rabies surveillance is crucial to prevent the transmission of bat-associated RABV to domestic animals in urban areas, especially after the recent declaration of AgV1-and 2-free area by the Brazilian government. This situation will in turn halt the mass vaccination of dogs and cats and promote susceptibility to bat-associated RABV.Only dead or possibly ill insectivore bats were collected in this study and no active surveillance was conducted. Therefore, proper inferences about the bat population distributions and dynamics were not possible. Moreover, all discussion is focused on bats collected in the urban area of Campinas [16] . Few bats from rural areas were collected since the rabies surveillance system performed by animal health authorities is specific but passive and only 2% of the Campinas population lives in these areas [16] . All areas of the city, particularly the peripheral zones, are systematically informed by UVZ about RABV infection from bats. Therefore, differences in specimen densities were not caused by the performance heterogeneity of the rabies surveillance system. The proportions of collected bat species were similar to those in other studies in Campinas [15] and elsewhere in Brazil [5] . No haematophagous bats were collected in this study, although one dog was infected with RABV AgV3 (D. rotundus lineage) in 2015. In recent years, RABV lineages similar to AgV3 have been identified in A. lituratus [13, 33, 34] .Regarding the location of the recorded specimens, most were found inside households. Molossidae was the primary contributor, with the highest proportions in the genera Tadarida and Nyctinomops, followed by Molossus, with the latter being the most frequently collected genus. Most of the RABV-positive samples from this genus were obtained in residential areas. Although Cynomops and Eumops showed similar proportions, no RABV-positive samples were detected. Tadarida was an exception because these bats were collected mostly in parks and protected areas downtown.In Molossidae, most of the specimens were captured alive, particularly Tadarida and Nyctinomops, which is a concerning fact, particularly for cats. Domestic cats are extremely attracted to moving objects and animals [35, 36] , and are therefore exposed to increased risk for rabies infection by Molossidae inside households. In Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae, most specimens were captured dead outside the households, and unsupervised or feral cats could have been exposed to or have actually preyed upon those bats.Vespertilionidae were more frequently captured in residential areas, where most of its RABV-positive samples were found. Most Phyllostomidae were also found in residential areas but in a lower proportion and were also collected in commercial and protected and public areas, where most of the RABV-positive samples were found. A. lituratus was the species with the highest RABV occurrence. Phyllostomidae were more densely found downtown, but Vespertilionidae were observed in urban-rural zones in peripheral areas of Campinas.Although the seasonality period of the three families was the same (1 year), peaks of Molossidae and Vespertilionidae findings were observed during summer, whereas the peak of Phyllostomidae was during winter. Molossidae were more frequently collected downtown, but the excess of relative risk for RABV infection was observed in peripheral zones of Campinas, which could be explained by analysing each species individually. M. molossus, the most abundant species in the sample, is sedentary, forming small colonies, but it might be the species that most benefited in the urban area of Campinas among all the collected species. The species is very adapted to man-made structures, particularly roof linings. Peak findings of these bats (mostly alive) were observed during summer, indicating that although the bats benefited from the increased density of insects attracted by city lights. Even so, they might have been marginally affected by pollution [37] , pesticides [38] or even (sometimes illegal) control by the inhabitants. Moreover, city lights can directly affect bat biology [20, 39] .Although composing only approximately the equivalent of 10% of the M. molossus sample and with no RABV-positive individuals being observed in the sample, Molossus rufus are notable because they are dispersive bats and may share roosts with other species, including M. molossus [40] . Interspecific contact, particularly the contact between haematophagous and nonhaematophagous bats, is an important epidemiological parameter that is not properly studied. However, because D. rotundus can also use man-made structures, such as roof linings, and eventually roosts with other species [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] , these bats may be responsible for infecting Molossus in rural areas. Moreover, Vespertilionidae species, such as Eptesicus sp. and Myotis sp., in which RABVpositive samples were observed, can also roost with other species, including D. rotundus, and showed high densities of findings in peripheral areas of Campinas. Although less susceptible to RABV infection from other species, M. molossus may be an important reservoir in peripheral areas and less important in urban areas despite the high density of findings downtown.T. brasiliensis showed a more restricted distribution of findings than M. molossus, but was also observed downtown. This species is migratory and can form very large colonies, the largest among the species collected in this study (up to 1 000 000 individuals) [46] . These bats can also roost in man-made structures, including roof linings, but were more frequently collected in parks and protected areas downtown. Unlike M. molossus, a high prevalence of RABV was observed, being the most important reservoir among Molossidae. The mass mortality of Tadarida due to RABV infection has been reported elsewhere [47, 48] , and the health authorities of Campinas should thus continuously investigate this species. Among the Molossidae collected in this study, T. brasiliensis should be considered the species with the highest capacity for introducing and maintaining different RABV lineages because of its capacity for migrating and forming colonies with numerous individuals. Compared with M. molossus, this bat might be more resilient to the urban environment because fewer specimens were collected by the passive surveillance system despite its high abundance.Although few Nyctinomops were collected, one sample tested RABV-positive and one reintroduction event in cats occurred in 2014 by a virus lineage specific to this species in Campinas. This species should also be monitored by the rabies surveillance system.Phyllostomidae were more frequently collected dead during winter. Although Phyllostomidae exhibit generalist feeding habits, insects are the primary item in the diet of this family, followed by fruits, nectar, flowers, pollen and other invertebrate animals [26] [27] [28] [29] [49] [50] [51] . Those food sources are all scarce during the winter, which is more likely the primary cause of the highest mortality in that season. Of the bat families collected in this study, Phyllostomidae was the least capable of using man-made structures and was also is the family that had the lowest proportion of specimens collected in residential areas. Thus, this family benefited least in the urban area of Campinas. Moreover, RABV prevalence was higher in Phyllostomidae (6.5%) than in the other families, particularly in A. lituratus, with the highest prevalence (16.7%) among all collected species and the only species in its family with RABV-positive samples. This result might have been caused by two factors, listed as follows: (a) Phyllostomidae exhibit reduced fitness because they are larger and heavier, requiring a more critical energy balance. Moreover, all collected species of this family are poliestric, and females are therefore more susceptible to seasonal changes in climate and food availability; (b) dispersal behaviour, with a daily change in the roost by females [52] , may increase the contact with other individuals, including other species. A. lituratus roosts preferably in treetops and palm trees, and from the collected species, few used the same roosts, including other Artibeus and Myotis albescens, which had the second largest RABV prevalence in the sample. However, because of the high RABV prevalence and dispersal behaviour, A. lituratus should also be a target species in the rabies surveillance system.Like Molossidae, Vespertilionidae also showed peaks of findings during summer. This family has different biological features; for example, most species roost with other species, including D. rotundus. Nearly all species feed on aerial insects, which are the most abundant in summer. Vespertilionidae were the smallest of the specimens collected in Campinas, but most of the species are poliestric and produce large progenies (in general, over two pups), making the energy balance critical and increasing the susceptibility to seasonal climatic changes. Vespertilionidae are the family most capable of using man-made structures and apparently the family that most benefit in the urban environment of Campinas. Although more frequently collected in peripheral areas, excess relative risk for RABV infection was observed downtown throughout the year, which intensified from winter to spring. This observation could be explained by the increased fitness in the urban environment and increased competition for food and roosts during the winter. For those reasons, Eptesicus sp. (particularly E. brasiliensis, which is sedentary) and Myotis sp., should be target species in the rabies surveillance system because they are more likely to have contact with other insectivore and haematophagous bat species and are therefore possibly responsible for the maintenance and dissemination of different RABV lineages. One of the RABV reintroduction events in cats was due to a Myotis lineage in 2016. Finally, RABV was not diagnosed in the two abundant species of Molossidae, C. planirostris and E. glaucinus. Both species showed a high density of findings downtown. Both form small colonies, but C. planirostris is smaller and lighter, roosting on fences and light poles, and is sedentary. E. glaucinus is more adaptable to man-made structures and is one of the few species collected in Campinas that hibernates. No specific biological features explained why RABV was not diagnosed in these species.Although only dogs were recorded to contact RABV-positive bats in 2015, cats should not be neglected in educational or strategic vaccinations. The probability of infectious contact between bats and domestic animals was previously calculated in Campinas, showing that such contacts are at least twofold higher in cats [15] . All the information available regarding bat fauna and RABV in urban areas is essential for the new challenges presenting with the declaration of RABV AgV1-and AgV2-free zones in Brazil by the Ministry of Health in 2015. This measure will end the mass vaccination of dogs and cats against rabies, most likely making most susceptible to bat or wildlife RABV. Moreover, education, awareness and when required, strategic dog and cat vaccinations should be prioritised to properly address this situation.  		1					1	
31198310	Empiric Antibiotic Therapy in the Treatment of Community-acquired Pneumonia in a General Hospital in Saudi Arabia	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6555230/	BACKGROUND: Guideline-based empiric antimicrobial therapy is recommended for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In this study, we evaluate the pattern of empiric antibiotics of CAP patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with CAP were retrieved from the health information unit using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision. The electronic pharmacy database was used to retrieve prescribed antibiotics and the duration of therapy for each antibiotic. RESULTS: A total of 1672 adult patients were included in the study and 868 (52%) were male. Of all the patients, 47 (2.8%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The most frequently used antibiotics were levofloxacin (68.12%), ceftriaxone (37.7%), imipenem-cilastatin (32.5%), and azithromycin (20.6%). The mean days of therapy of each of these antibiotics were 3.2, 2.8, 4.4, and 2.9, respectively. A combination therapy of levofloxacin and imipenem-cilastatin was prescribed for 355 (21.8%) of non-ICU patients versus 20 (60.6%) of ICU patients (P = 0.0007). Imipenem-cilastatin was prescribed for 518 (31.8%) of non-ICU patients versus 25 (56.8%) of ICU patients (P = 0.0009). Levofloxacin was prescribed for 1106 (68%) of non-ICU patients versus 33 (75%) of ICU patients (P = 0.412). Ceftriaxone use decreased significantly from 40.9% in 2013 to 25.9% in 2016 (P = 0.034). In addition, levofloxacin use increased from 63.7% to 75% (P = 0.63). CONCLUSION: The most commonly used antibiotics were levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, imipenem-cilastatin, and azithromycin. The data call for further refinement and prospective audit of antibiotic use in CAP, especially in non-ICU settings.				1					
31455126	Establishing Appropriate Agency Relationships for Providers in China	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6713957/	Physicians play multiple roles in a health system. They typically serve simultaneously as the agent for patients, for insurers, for their own medical practices, and for the hospital facilities where they practice. Theoretical and empirical results have demonstrated that financial relations among these different stakeholders can affect clinical outcomes as well as the efficiency and quality of care. What are the physicians’ roles as the agents of Chinese patients? The marketization approach of China’s economic reforms since 1978 has made hospitals and physicians profit-driven. Such profit-driven behavior and the financial tie between hospitals and physicians have in turn made physicians more the agents of hospitals rather than of their patients. While this commentary acknowledges physicians’ ethics and their dedication to their patients, it argues that the current physician agency relation in China has created barriers to achieving some of the central goals of current provider-side health care reform efforts. In addition to eliminating existing perverse financial incentives for both hospitals and physicians, the need for which is already agreed upon by numerous scholars, we argue that the success of the ongoing Chinese public hospital reform and of overall health care reform also relies on establishing appropriate physician-hospital agency relations. This commentary proposes 2 essential steps to establish such physician-hospital agency relations: (1) minimize financial ties between senior physicians and tertiary-level public hospitals by establishing a separate reimbursement system for senior physicians, and (2) establishing a comprehensive physician professionalism system underwritten by the Chinese government, professional physician associations, and major health care facilities as well as by physician leadership representatives. Neither of these suggestions is addressed adequately in current health care reform activities.	Introduction  Chinese health system development and economic reforms in the past 70 years have nurtured the current unique physician agency relations in China. Between 1949 and 1978, the Chinese health care system was designed with the objective to provide "equal access for all regardless of ability to pay," an ideology championed by the Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong. 1 To achieve this goal, the Chinese government INQUIRY assumed control of all aspects of health care and delivery-it provided funding for the construction of hospitals and clinics, paid health workers a fixed salary, and set the prices for medicines and services. 2 At that time, all physicians became employees of public hospitals, establishing the foundation of the current dominating role of public hospitals, especially tertiary-level public hospitals in China. 3 While the post-1978 economic reforms and the marketoriented approach have helped develop the Chinese health care system (eg, the number of hospitals in China has increased from 9902 to 20 918 between 1980 and 2010), 4 new challenges have also emerged. First, governmental subsidies to public health care facilities declined dramatically after 1978. The government's subsidies to public hospitals fell to merely 10% of their total expenditures by the 1990s, 5 and 90% or more of Chinese public hospitals' revenue continued to depend on drug sales and services in 2010. 6 While Chinese public hospitals continued to have a bureaucratic and complex government-run regulation and management system, 3 they also were expected to behave like for-profit entities to earn profit to survive and to continue being competitive in the health care market. 7 Second, because laborrelated medical services remained underpriced, 8 the Chinese government set a higher margin rate for high-technology procedures and diagnostic tests, and hospitals are allowed to charge a 15% to 25% mark-up on drug sales (15% for Western medicine and 25% for Traditional Chinese Medicine). 9 Such policies provided financial incentives for hospitals to begin a "medical arms race" to scale up their provision of high-technology diagnostics and interventions, as well as to overprescribe drugs. [10] [11] [12] Third, most of senior physicians' income from hospitals is still a combination of basic salary and bonus, 13 with the bonus coming from hospitals' financial profit. 14 To increase their hospital's profit, hospital management tied the physicians' bonus to their contribution to hospital profits, which has intensified the overprescription of drugs and overuse of diagnostic tests. 5, 7, 8, [10] [11] [12] [15] [16] [17] Such an extrinsic bonus incentive method may also "crowd-out" physicians' intrinsic concerns for other important aspects of health care, for example, the health care quality and population health. 18 Some scholars have commented that these financial incentives even may have directly eroded physicians' ethics. 17, 19 Because of this strong alignment of financial incentives, senior physicians in effect can become more the agents for public hospitals rather than for their patients.There has been concern in the past that the rise of China's promarket health care delivery system between 1978 and 2002 had sown the seed for a major public health breakout, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), in 2003 in China. 20 The SARS epidemic combined with other health services issues, for example, increasing out-of-pocket health care expenditures and insurmountable access barriers to health care (in a popular Chinese proverb: kanbingnan, kanbinggui), led to a comprehensive health care reform in 2008. 20 Although some researchers may not completely agree, 21 by 2012, this Chinese health care reform has achieved significant progress toward the first 4 goals set in 2008, including expanding social insurance coverage and public health services, improving the primary care delivery system, and establishing an essential medicines system. 20 However, by 2012, the pilot public hospital reforms in 17 cities had failed to deliver meaningful results, 20 and the progress of public hospital reforms had been slow. 6 Currently, public hospital reform remains one of the major issues on the Chinese health care reform agenda. The number of public hospital reform piloting cities expanded to 100 in 2015, and all the city-level public hospitals and hospitals above this grade were expected to be undergoing reform by 2017. 22 The Chinese government believed that health care reform had already entered the "deep water zone" in that public hospital reform was the most difficult component. 23 In the Chinese State Council's "The Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for Deepening Healthcare System Reform," the government listed several aspects of public hospital reform as one of the most important tasks. 24 In addition to the general public hospital reform challenges shared with other countries (eg, the 3 structural sources and the 3 contextual sources summarized by Edwards and Saltman), 25 China's current public hospital reform confronts several unique challenges. Among these unique challenges is the lack of appropriate and clear physician agency relations caused by the combination of the dominating role of tertiary-level public hospitals, public hospitals' profitdriven behaviors, the existing strong financial ties between physicians and public hospitals, and the lack of a comprehensive physician professionalism system.  Chinese Public Hospitals  Chinese hospitals can be categorized as "public" and "nonpublic" by registration status, or "government owned," "social enterprise owned," and "investor owned" by ownership status. 4 In this commentary, we use "private hospitals" as a general category for the "non-public hospitals." Since 1989, the former Chinese Ministry of Health established a hospital accreditation system to categorize hospitals into 3 grades (3, 2, and 1), as well as 3 within-grade levels (A, B, and C), mainly based on size (20-99 beds for primary hospital, 100-499 for secondary hospital, and above 500 for tertiary hospital), and other factors including service, technology, and quality. 9 Almost all the tertiary-level hospitals are public hospitals.Public hospitals hold a dominate position in terms of patient volume, medical technology, and high-quality practitioners. The percentage of total inpatient admissions made by public hospitals was about 90% by 2012, the percentage of inpatient admissions by government-owned hospitals remained about 84% between 2005 and 2012, and the percentage of inpatient admissions at tertiary-level hospitals during this latter period actually increased from 28% to 37% (see Table 1 ). 4 The dominating role of public hospitals also can be observed in variation of occupancy rates: In 2012, the bed occupancy rate was 94.2% for public hospitals, 104.5% for tertiary-level public hospitals, as against 63.2% for private hospitals. 4 Public hospitals accounted for 88.15% of the inpatient surgeries as of 2012. 4 Public hospitals also are the employers of most high-quality practitioners, for example, 82.07% of practicing physicians worked at public hospitals and 86.33% of registered nurses worked at public hospitals as of 2012. 4 The public data from China Health Statistical Yearbook are available up to 2012; however, based on the trend between 2005 and 2012, the dominating role of tertiarylevel public hospitals has not changed much since 2012. For example, China's public hospitals accounted for more than 85% of both inpatient and outpatient care as of 2015. 26 For most tertiary-level public hospitals, senior physicians are the attending physicians who control and manage a number of hospital beds, serving also as leader of a group of junior physicians and residents. Attending or senior physicians have a significant role in generating hospitals' revenue, and such revenue is tied to his or her own income as mentioned above. Therefore, even though physician-agency relation issues exist at all levels of public hospitals as well as private hospitals, the financial relation between specifically tertiary-level public hospitals and senior physicians remains a major barrier for the recent provider-related health care reform activities discussed below, reflecting the dominating medical role of tertiary-level public hospitals in China's health care system.  Key Provider Related Reforms in China Since 2013 and Associated Challenges  As part of its new round of health care reform in 2013, the Chinese government tried to improve the overall efficiency, access, and quality of care with a series of provider-related policies. These policies include (1) promoting private hospitals owned by domestic social capital and foreign investors, (2) further establishing physicians' multilocation practice systems, and (3) eliminating the drug mark-up for public hospitals. However, the current unbalanced set of physicianagency relationships has become one of the major barriers to the success of these reform measures.  Promoting Private Hospitals Owned By Domestic Social Capital and Foreign Investors  Since 2013, a new round of health care reform returned to a market-oriented direction for provider-related reforms, with promoting private hospitals as a major policy. 20 The Chinese government hopes to create competition among current lowefficiency public hospitals with newly established private hospitals, to improve the overall efficiency and quality of the entire health care system. 7 The "National Planning Guideline for the Healthcare Service System (2015-2020)" released in 2015 reemphasized "strongly develop non-public healthcare facilities" as one of the 5 concrete tasks, 27 though the government's goal of treating 20% of the patient population in private hospitals by 2015 seems not to have been reached. 28 The policy of promoting private hospitals has faced a number of barriers due to current physician-agency relationships. In particular, recruiting physicians to new private hospitals, especially senior physicians, has been a significant challenge. 29 Senior physicians prefer to remain at tertiarylevel public hospitals for professional as well as financial reasons, where senior physician resources and service volume remain concentrated 30 and where service volume is reinforced by the existing pattern of greater trust among patients in large public hospitals compared with other health care facilities. 3 If new private hospitals are to emerge and establish themselves, the relationship between senior and/or more highly respected physicians and tertiary-level public hospitals will have to give way to a more balanced public/private set of physician relationships. Second, the emerging private hospitals owned by social enterprise or investors are more likely to be for-profit, and such profit-driven nature will make the physicians practicing at their facilities profit-making agents as well. Strengthened physicians' professionalism will be even more important in an environment where physicians are practicing at explicitly for-profit facilities.  Establishing Physicians' Multilocation Practice Systems  Given that a central challenge for private hospitals' development has been the difficulty of recruiting senior physicians, an almost hand-in-hand reform initiative alongside promoting private hospitals was to allow physicians to practice in more than one hospital: for example, to enable physician multilocation practice. This multilocation practice policy also sought to redistribute patient flow to lower level health care facilities by better distributing more senior physician resources who previously had practiced only in tertiary-level public hospitals. 30 On January 2015, the Chinese National Health and Family Planning Committee, the National Development and Reform Commission, and 3 other Chinese National Commissions under the State Council released the newest regulation for the promotion of physician multilocation practice, further reducing the regulatory and administrative barriers for senior physicians to practice in other health institutes. 31 By transforming currently employed physicians into "free agents" in the medical marketplace, the multilocation practice policy seeks to break the domination of physician resources by tertiary-level public hospitals. However, critical barriers still exist, and the establishment of multilocation practice will itself create new challenges. First, even though the Chinese government seeks to promote physicians' mobility, it is not surprising that such policies have had little success due to resistance from the tertiary-level public hospitals. As described above, with physicians' income and hospitals' profit so strongly tied together in the existing tertiary-level public hospital arrangement, physicians have become in effect the agents of their hospital. In addition, the nature of uncertainty of medical services and the asymmetry of information 32,33 demonstrate the difficulty of evaluating physicians' performance at their own employer hospital. Holmstrom and Milgrom pointed out that a firm should restrict its agents from conducting outside activities if it is difficult to measure the performance of the agent's "inside firm activity." 34 As a result, while physicians are still agents and employees of tertiary-level public hospitals, it will be difficult to design an appropriate profit/cost sharing mechanism between physicians' current employer hospitals and the facilities they choose for multilocation practice. In all these respects, the tertiary-level public hospitals become a natural barrier to the development of multilocation practices.Second, the implementation of physician multilocation practice policy may itself create new problems, including health service quality and increased patient risk. To practice in additional health care facilities, some Chinese physicians are establishing private physician-group companies. 35 However, government regulations on physicians' groups or physicians practicing in other health care facilities are still vague and insufficient. 36 Even though the current regulations and code of conduct for Chinese physicians may not be ideal, physicians are at least under the regulation and supervision of their employers: public hospitals. If physicians can practice at other health care facilities freely or as an employee of loosely regulated physician-group companies, the current immature physician professionalism system does not have the capability to substitute for the current regulatory role served by employer hospitals in terms of ensuring appropriate procedures, care quality, and risk control.  Eliminating the Drug Mark-up for Public Hospitals  To eliminate the perverse financial incentives related to drug mark-up policies described above, from 2015, the Chinese government began to eliminate the 15% drug cost markup for public hospitals (eg, zero mark-up drug policy). By September 30, 2017, all public hospitals should have eliminated the drug markup (except for Traditional Chinese Medicine). 37 To compensate for the loss of revenue to public hospitals, most labor-related services such as physician service fees, inpatient bed fees, nursing fees, surgery fees, and traditional medicine rehabilitation fees have all been increased. The comprehensive payment structure reform required that, on average, the increased fee schedule will compensate 90% of the drug mark-up profit loss for countylevel hospitals and above. 38 The goal of this policy is to eliminate the incentive for physicians to overprescribe expensive drugs and high-technology diagnostics tests. However, if physicians' incomes are still tied to public hospitals' profit, hospitals can design other financial incentive systems to reward physicians who help hospitals to increase profit. Multiple studies have already reported that hospitals and physicians responded by increasing physician and other service charges. [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] One recent study on a well-recognized reform model, "Sanming," 26, 43 also showed the zero mark-up drug policy's effect on reducing expenditure faded over the long term. 44 Lack of a proper professional code for Chinese physicians could make physicians' and hospitals' fee response behaviors even more extensive.In summary, the post-1978 Chinese health care system's development has had the overall effect of making Chinese physicians more the agents of hospitals rather than of their patients. Substantial evidence has shown that the financial tie between physicians and tertiary-level public hospitals is a critical reason for much of existing inefficiency or even misuse of health care resources. 11, 12, 16 More recently, the existing strong financial relation between senior physicians and tertiary public hospitals also has jeopardized efforts to create competition from emerging private hospitals as well as reform measures that allow physicians to practice among multiple health care facilities. The eventual goal of current Chinese health care reforms is to create a market with providers of numerous ownership, including public and forprofit private hospitals, and to redistribute physician resources from currently dominating public hospitals to other settings. To achieve this long-term goal with sustainable physician-patient and physician-hospital agency relations, a systematically well-developed physician professionalism system will also be necessary.  Reducing the Financial Relationship Between Tertiary-Level Public Hospitals and Senior Physicians  The Chinese government has implemented policies to reduce overprescribing behaviors; however, more needs to be done to align physicians' incentives with the patient population. 17 An important next step is to disconnect the close financial relationship between senior physicians and the profit earned by tertiary-level public hospitals. An existing tool the Chinese government may consider is the US Resource Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS), 45 which could be modified so as to represent Chinese physicians' workload and value in a scientifically valid manner.The Chinese version of an RBRVS system to pay physicians directly based on workload, specialty, length of training, risk, quality of care, service location, and so on would support both private hospital development and multilocation physician practice by cutting the current tight financial relationship between senior physicians and the currently dominating tertiary-level public hospitals. The Chinese version of RBRVS could also increase physicians' current income by properly reflecting physicians' value, solving the issue of underpaid physician services, 8 so that physicians will not rely on drug sales, inducement of services, or other financial incentive systems designed by hospitals. The Chinese version of RBRVS could also incorporate health care outcome, patient satisfaction, population health, and other qualityrelated measures based on specialty, to create positive incentives on physicians' behaviors that align with the overall Chinese health care reform goals of 2030.Of course, to design and implement an independent physician reimbursement system would require a substantial administrative and legal framework, for example, establishing billing and collection processes, and comprehensive malpractice insurance for physicians if they are practicing independently, all of which are public hospitals' responsibility in the current situation. We recognize the significant investment of time and funding necessary to implement an independent physician reimbursement system for senior physicians at tertiary public hospital level; however, given the current situation in China, the advantages of such a major reform outweigh the disadvantages, especially considering the expected long-term effects on efficiency and quality of service within the health care delivery system. In addition, as the function, goal, and financial sources for health care facilities in rural areas, and also for secondary level and community-based primary care systems in urban settings, are very different than those of tertiary-level public hospitals, 17 physicians practicing at these lower intensity health care facilities should be paid using the current approach until the Chinese version of RBRVS is operating and mature.  Developing a Comprehensive Physician Professionalism System  Changing financial relations will increase physicians' mobility; however, changing only the physician-hospital financial relationship will be insufficient to adequately regulate physicians' behavior, especially given the Chinese government's expectation that the physician will increasingly practice in multiple locations. This observation leads to the conclusion that a comprehensive physician professionalism system will also be necessary to serve as the foundation for a long-term solution for the recently introduced provider-related health care reforms.As the base of a health care system, a physician's professionalism can be traced to the Oath of Hippocrates. 46 In the United States, the Flexner Report in 1910 was an important landmark in the development of a modern medical profession, and some scholars further defined its physician professionalism framework based on Flexner's perspectives. 47 In an increasing complex health care delivery system, physician professionalism may be defined in various frameworks with multiple ways. To be sure, physicians in China with their Confucian-based culture may not interpret or fully practice exactly the Western standard of physician professionalism. 48 However, China's health system development has demonstrated that market mechanisms alone do not have the capability to create a high-functioning professionalism structure for physicians. 8 A comprehensive physician professionalism system tailored to Chinese culture and social background may need the engagement and collaboration of government, professional physician associations, health care facilities, and physician leadership representatives. However, almost no efforts for physician professionalism have been implemented as part of the newest round of health care reform. 49 The development of a comprehensive physician professionalism system should be implemented at macro, meso, and micro levels, a multipronged approach which has proved to be an effective health care reform strategy in a number of countries. 50 At the macro level, the Chinese government should design a high-level legal framework and regulation to prohibit hospitals using measures related to volume or contribution of profit to incentivize physicians. The US Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute provide examples of how Western legal systems keep the autonomy and professionalism of practitioners separate from health care facilities. A professional physician association, for example, the Chinese Medical Association, should assume a larger role in developing, monitoring, and supervising high-level physicians' professional values and behaviors. Such professional values and behaviors should also be incorporated into the competencies of physician accreditation. The Chinese Medical Association may consider some of the standards designed by its Western counterparts. 51 In addition, physician professionalism will require broader social awareness, support, and an alliance between society and the medicine profession. 52 (See Table 2 for summary of "Stakeholder," "Major Responsibilities and Goal," and "Example," for the 3 levels.)At the meso level, a physician governance body, either independent physician group companies or the physician governance body within a health care facility, should design, To be a role model for young physicians • • Role modeling is a crucial area for physician professionalism development and mutually beneficial for both educator and learner 59 monitor and evaluate physicians' professional behavior as part of the physicians' key performance review. 53 Health care facilities should seek to create a clear culture to support physician professionalism and to align their internal culture with an overall physician professionalism framework. 54 Physician leaders' roles in nurturing this new environment and to be a liaison between physicians and health care facilities are also important. 55 At the micro level, physician professionalism is a lifelearning experience, 60 and needs to be reinforced during already challenging daily practice. 61 The establishment of physician personal professionalism requires a combination of medical school and graduate medical education, 56,57 self and peer assessment, 58 role model of attending physicians, 59 and specific values and behaviors to interact with patients, health care team, and health care facilities. 55 A combination approach. We recognize that every reimbursement structure has its caveats, either in efficiency, quality, or cost control. 62 However, in any reimbursement structure, a strong financial relationship between physicians and health care facilities can always enable health care facilities to design mechanisms to benefit their own financial goals. 63 The current most important barrier for the Chinese public hospital reform is the lack of competition caused by the existing financial relations between public hospitals and senior physicians. The Chinese government has tried to leverage private hospital investment, use policy to promote physicians' mobility, and change reimbursement policy, to overcome these barriers. However, the financial relations between large public hospitals and senior physicians still allow public hospitals to design mechanisms to maintain their dominating positions. A RBRVS system reimbursing senior physicians directly will be able to eliminate such financial ties. Separating senior physicians from public hospitals as "free-agents" will promote the current provider-side reform, even though this strategy may also create other issues, such as the need to more closely monitor and supervise physician behavior. Therefore, a well-designed comprehensive physician professionalism system can serve as the foundation for a long-term solution that can promote provider-related reform activities.  Concluding Observations  Health systems in different countries have their own historical background and limitations, and even health systems in developed countries such as Europe 64 and the United States 65 currently confront significant challenges. The Chinese health system has gone through its own developmental phases and is facing unique challenges. We recognize that simply copying the health care reimbursement and managerial system from another country is unlikely to be successful in the Chinese context, and that any health system reform needs to be aligned with a country's unique background and current stage of health system development.At the current health system reform stage in China, the physician agency issue has become a central operational factor, one that can systematically jeopardize other essential provider-side reform measures. Physicians are multitasking agents in health care services, and some outcomes of their tasks are more difficult to evaluate than others. 34 Even in the United States and other Western developed countries, establishing provider payment systems that create effective incentives for both cost control and quality improvement is difficult. 62 The Chinese health care system is moving toward case-based or diagnosis-related group-based reimbursement approach for hospitals. 66 Under such a prospective payment system, how physicians balance hospital interests, their own income, and patients' benefits is a crucial measure of the physicians' care decisions. 67 If physicians' personal income is still tied to their employer hospitals' profit and hospitaldesigned financial incentives, however, it may be more likely that physicians will continue to prioritize hospital's or their own profit rather than patients' interest. A study on the impact of reimbursement method change from fee-for-service to per-diem for a Chinese public psychiatric hospital illustrated that the payment policy had not achieved its anticipated goals because physicians' behaviors were still tied to the original financial incentives the hospital had designed. 68 Chinese health care professionals have demonstrated a strong commitment to society, especially during natural disasters. 69 However, providers' behaviors in terms of health care service quality and quantity are associated with physicians' remuneration approach. 70 In this commentary, we contend that a major barrier to achieving the government's prospective goals for its health care delivery reform in China is the lack of an appropriate physician-agency relationship. As a central strategy to overcome this barrier, we suggest reducing the direct financial tie between tertiary-level public hospitals and physicians, and establishing a comprehensive system of physician professionalism in China.To be sure, provide-side reform in China is more complex than only the 2 issues described here. Other factors will also influence the efficiency and effectiveness of health care reform efforts, for example, public funding to public hospitals, 14 public hospital governance, 71 resource allocation between rural and urban areas, 72,73 health care professional workforce development, 74 patients' experience, 75 community-based primary care, 76 and associated referral system. 7 However, as Yip, Wagstaff, and Hsiao 77 summarized earlier, more in-depth understanding of physicians' incentives are necessary, and as La Forgia and Yip pointed out subsequently, 28 the critical reform direction for providers is the alignment of providers' interests with the general social welfare rather than their individual income. All of these directions require the 2 aspects we propose: minimizing the INQUIRY financial tie between tertiary-level public hospitals and physicians, and establishing a high-standard physician professionalism system in China.

32063900	Isolation and Selection of Duck Primary Cells as Pathogenic and Innate Immunologic Cell Models for Duck Plague Virus	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6999086/	Duck plague virus (DPV) is a representative pathogen transmitted among aquatic animals that causes gross lesions and immune inhibition in geese and ducks. The mechanism of organ tropism and innate immune evasion of DPV has not been completely deciphered due to a lack of cell models to study the innate immune manipulation and pathogenicity of aquatic viruses. In the present study, we isolated five types of duck primary cells [duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs), neurons, astrocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and monocytes/macrophages] to identify appropriate cell models for DPV, using tropism infection and innate immunologic assays. Cells responded differently to stimulation with DNA viruses or RNA virus analogs. DPV infection exhibited broad tropism, as the recombinant virulent strain (CHv-GFP) infected DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, and monocytes/macrophages, but not the PBMCs, as the expression of EGFP was negligible. The basal levels of innate immunity molecules were highest in monocytes/macrophages and lower in DEFs and astrocytes. Conversely, the titer and genomic copy number of the attenuated virus strain was higher in DEFs and astrocytes than in neurons and monocytes/macrophages. The titer and genomic copy number of the attenuated virus strain were higher compared with the virulent strain in DEFs, neurons, and astrocytes. The innate immune response was not significantly induced by either DPV strain in DEFs, neurons, or astrocytes. The virulent strain persistently infected monocytes/macrophages, but the attenuated strain did so abortively, and this was accompanied by the phenomenon of innate immune inhibition and activation by the virulent and attenuated strains, respectively. Blockage of IFNAR signaling promoted replication of the attenuated strain. Pre-activation of IFNAR signaling inhibited infection by the virulent strain. The selection assay results indicated that induction of innate immunity plays an essential role in controlling DPV infection, and monocytes/macrophages are an important cell model for further investigations. Our study provided practical methods for isolating and culturing duck primary cells, and our results will facilitate further investigations of organ tropism, innate immune responses, latent infection, and the effectiveness of antiviral drugs for treating DPV and potentially other aerial bird pathogens.

The selection assay results indicated that induction of innate immunity plays an essential role in controlling DPV infection, and monocytes/macrophages are an important cell model for further investigations. Our study provided practical methods  INTRODUCTION  The innate immune response is the first line of host defense against microbial pathogens. Various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play an essential role in detecting pathogenassociated molecular pattern (PAMP) associated with invading pathogens. PAMP recognition initiates an innate immune response, characterized by the production of type I interferon (IFN), proinflammatory cytokines, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (1, 2) . PRRs comprise multiple family members, including toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, and cytosolic dsDNA sensors (CDSs). RLRs primarily recognize 5 ′ -phoshorylated RNAs, including ssRNA or dsRNA produced during the replication of RNA or DNA viruses (3) . Although RIG-I predominantly recognizes RNA viruses, the RIG-I/Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) pathway is also activated during infection with several DNA viruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), Epstein-Barr virus, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (4) (5) (6) . During infection with DNA viruses, RNA polymerase III recognizes AT-rich dsDNA and transcribes the dsDNA into dsRNA containing a 5-triphosphate moiety that activates the RIG-I/MAVS pathway to induce IFN-β production (7) . DNA from viruses or bacteria can be detected by Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and potentially RLR, which potentially activate the endoplasmic reticulum-resident adaptor protein, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), to translocate from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, where it activates TBK1-IRF3 and -NF-κB, resulting in robust induction of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokine production (8) . IFN-I binds to IFNAR and activates R1-associated Tyk2 protein tyrosine kinase and the IFNalpha/beta R2-associated Jak1 protein tyrosine kinase, which subsequently regulate the phosphorylation and activation of different STAT proteins; the activated STAT proteins homoor heterodimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they promote the expression of numerous target genes. Binding of STAT proteins to either ISREs or GAS sites regulates the expression of several hundred ISGs, which mediate the anti-viral, anti-proliferative, and apoptotic effects of type I IFNs.Duck plague (DP), also known as duck viral enteritis (DVE), is caused by Anatid herpesvirus type 1 (AHV-1) or duck plague virus (DPV), which is an enveloped, dsDNA virus of the Herpesviridae family, subfamily alpha-Herpesvirinae (9, 10) . First reported in the Netherlands in 1923, DP spread rapidly around the world (11, 12) . Although typically an acute or sometimes chronic and highly contagious disease, DP is characterized by high mortality rates (up to 100%) among domestic (12) and wild ducks, swans, geese, and other waterfowl of different ages. To prevent DP outbreaks on duck farms, attenuated DPV vaccines have been widely used; in China, use of these vaccines is compulsory, with billions of doses administered annually (13, 14) .DPV is the only herpes virus circulating in aquatic animals identified to date. Infection with virulent DPV strains causes gross lesions in ducks in most tissues, including the heart, liver, spleen, bursa, and brain (15, 16) , where the virus has been detected (12, 17) . Upregulation of PRRs and ISGs expression has been reported, indicating that DPV exhibits broad organ tropism and activates the innate immune system (18, 19) . Differing basal and induced levels of PRRs and ISGs among different cell types and organs are important factors in determining the organ tropism of viruses such as poliovirus, reovirus, and murine coronavirus (20) (21) (22) . Recently published data indicated that expression of RIG-I, galectin-1, MAVS, STING, and IRF1 is induced in DPV-infected ducks, demonstrating the strong capacity of the innate immune response to restrict DPV infection via over-expression of these factors in DEFs, although it is difficult to detect changes in these factors in DEFs infected with a high titer of DPV (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) .According to a previous study, TLR8, IRF3, ISG15, ISG54, and ISG56 (IFITs) are missing in birds, chickens also lack RIG-I and Riplet (28) , and the immune system of birds is different from that of mammals. Development of a suitable cell model for in-depth investigations of the mechanism of the innate immune response to DPV and the virus's ability to evade that response is thus an important priority. In the present study, therefore, we isolated and cultured five types of duck primary cells in vitro and then compared the basal and innate immune responses to DNA and RNA virus analogs. The cell tropism of DPV and changes in innate immune signaling induced by DPV infection and the antiviral effect of IFNAR signaling against DPV infection were also investigated. The isolation and characterization of different types of duck primary cells could facilitate elucidation of the mechanism governing the organ tropism of DPV and the relationship between DPV infection and host antiviral innate immune responses.  Ethics Statement  All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with approved guidelines. One-month-old Peking ducklings were purchased from a DPV-free farm where vaccination against DPV was not implementation. All the ducks were housed in the animal facility at Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China. The study was approved by the Committee of Experiment Operational Guidelines and Animal Welfare of Sichuan Agricultural University (approved permit number XF2014-18).  Duck Embryo Fibroblast Isolation and Culture  Nine-day-old duck embryos were cleaned with 75% ethanol and placed on a 6-well plate. The head, wings, legs, and viscera were removed, and the muscle tissues were washed with HBSS, cut into 1-mm pieces, and then digested with 0.1% trypsin for 10 min at room temperature (RT). After digestion, the trypsin was removed via centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 min, and the digested tissues were dissociated by repeated pipetting (∼30 times), after which the mixture was filtered through autoclaved medical gauze. Single cells were collected and plated in cell culture plates or dishes and cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco-BRL, Carlsbad CA, USA). Usually, DEFs were cultured to 100% confluence for 24 h and then passaged and sub-cultured for use in subsequent assays.  Isolation of Duck Neurons  Duck neurons were isolated according to our previously described method for isolating mouse neurons (29) . Briefly, the brain was collected from 9-day-old duck embryos, the meninges were peeled away and carefully removed, and the cortex was transferred into a new dish filled with HBSS, and then cut into 1-mm pieces by using scissors; the shears were transferred into 0.1% trypsin diluted in HBSS and digested for 20 min at RT. The trypsin was removed by transferring the brain cells into a new tube with proper DMEM, and then DNase I was added and treated for 5 min at RT. The DNase I was removed and the cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,200 rpm for 10 min at RT. Then, the collected cells were resuspended with DMEM and dissociated by repeated pipetting (<15 times). The cells were passed through a 75-nm nylon mesh (Corning, NY, USA) to separate the single cells, washed once in HBSS, and then cultured in D-polylysine-pretreated plates in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 6 h. Finally, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the medium was replaced with serum-free, neural-basal medium supplemented with 2% B-27 PLUS (Gibco-BRL, NY, USA), and the cells were incubated for 5 days to form a monolayer.  Isolation of Duck Primary Astrocytes  Primary duck astrocytes were isolated primarily according to the procedure described above for isolating duck neurons, with some differences. Brain cells passed through a 75-nm nylon mesh were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 24 h, washed once with PBS, and then cultured in the same medium for 4 days to form a monolayer. The medium was changed every 2 days. Similar to DEFs, astrocytes readily agglomerated and detached from the plates or dishes once they began to overgrow.  Isolation of Duck PBMCs  Duck PBMCs were isolated from the 1-month-old anticoagulation whole blood by density gradient centrifugation using a Duck Leukocyte Isolation kit (TBDscience, Tianjin, China), according to the manufacturer's instructions and our previous study (30) . Briefly, whole blood was collected from the jugular vein of mature ducks and placed in anticoagulant-containing tubes. The blood was then diluted with sample dilution buffer and slowly added onto a layer of duck lymphocyte isolation buffer (density: 1.077 ± 0.001 g/ml) to avoid mixing and then centrifuged at 500 g for 30 min at RT. The second grayishwhite layer was transferred into a new tube, and resuspended in 20 ml washing buffer and the mixed cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min at RT. The collected cells were resuspended in 3 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer for 3 min and then 20 ml of washing buffer was added into the cells. Then, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min at RT. The remaining cells were adjusted to 2 × 10 7 cells/ml and 1 ml of cells was plated in one well of the 12-well plate, and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 2 h to allow for attachment to the plate; unattached cells were removed by washing twice with PBS, followed by addition of fresh medium. The isolated PBMCs were then ready for use in assays.  Isolation of Duck Monocytes/Macrophages  Duck monocytes/macrophages were isolated according to a reported method for isolating human macrophages (31) . Briefly, duck PBMCs were prepared as described above. Adherent cells were enriched among PBMCs by adherence on plastic culture plates for 2 h. Non-adherent cells were removed via vigorous washing three times using pre-warmed PBS; the adherent cells were digested with trypsin for cell count. Duck monocyte-derived macrophages were differentiated from adherent monocytes in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with L-glutamine (2 mM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), 10% heatinactivated FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 50 ng/ml human M-CSF (Novoprotein, Shanghai, China). The medium was changed every 2 days, and duck macrophages formed a monolayer by day 7. In our present isolation method, only adherent cells are able to differentiate into macrophages under the induction of M-CSF; lymphocytes in PBMCs (mainly including T cells, B cells, and NK killer cells) continue to die due to inability to differentiate under induction of M-CSF and are removed by constantly replacing fresh medium.  Antibodies, Virus Strains, and Reagents  The virulent strain of DPV, CHv, was isolated and characterized by our lab (32) . The recombinant virulent strain of DPV, BAC-CHv-EGFP (CHv-GFP), was constructed by our research center (33) . The attenuated vaccine strain of DPV, CHa, was retrieved from storage at our research center. The Duck Tambusu virus (DTMUV) was stored at our research center. Each DPV and DTMUV strain was propagated on DEFs. The Rabbit antihuman MAP2 and -human GFAP polyclonal antibody and the goat anti-human β-actin monoclonal antibody were purchased from Abclonal (Wuhan, China). Mouse anti-duck CD80 (Gene ID:101796029) and CD86 (Gene ID:101794331) antibodies were generated by our research center. Ruxolitinib, poly(dA:dT), and poly(I:C) were purchased from Invivogen (Hong Kong, China).  Western Blot  The cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0; 150 mM sodium chloride; 1% Triton X-100; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (Roche), and the protein concentrations were measured using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal quantities of protein were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad), which were blocked with 5% non-fat milk before being incubated with primary antibodies against CD80, CD86, or β-actin and then probed with the appropriate secondary antibodies. The blots were then visualized using ECL reagent (GE, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and detected under an Intelligent dark box II (GE, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).  Innate Immune Response of Duck Primary Cells to DNA and RNA Virus Analogs  Duck primary DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages were treated with the DNA and RNA virus analogs poly(dA:dT) or poly(I:C), respectively, at a dose of 5 µg/ml for 24 h. The cells were then lysed in Trizol reagent for RNA isolation to assess the innate immune response to the stimulators using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).  Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA)  Primary duck neurons, astrocytes, or monocytes/macrophages were cultured for 4, 4, or 7 days, respectively, to form a confluent monolayer. The cells were then fixed with 4% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, blocked with 10% BSA dissolved in PBS for 30 min, and then incubated with primary antibodies against MAP2, GFAP, CD80, and CD86 at 4 • C overnight. The cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit ormouse secondary antibodies or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or -mouse secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT. Images were acquired using fluorescence microscopy.  Virus Infection and Determination of TCID 50  For virus infection, the required dose of virus was diluted in the medium used to culture the various types of duck primary cells (5 × 10 6 cells in a 12-well plate) and incubated with cells at 37 • C for 1 h. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and maintained in the corresponding medium supplemented with 2% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The culture supernatant of virus-infected cells was collected and titrated to determine the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) on DEFs using 10-fold serial dilutions.  Determination of Virus Copy Number  Viral DNA was extracted using a HIPURE viral DNA mini kit (Magen, Guangdong, China) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. DPV genomic DNA in infected cells was quantified using an absolute Q-PCR method as previously described (17) using primers specific to the sequence of DPV UL30 (primers are listed in Table 1 ). A standard curve was generated from serially diluted plasmids harboring the entire Coding sequence of UL30 and using the same PCR procedure as used for cell samples. DPV copy number in infected cells was calculated according to the standard curve and normalized to 1 µg of total DNA.  RNA Isolation and qRT-PCR  RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol R Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions; the genomic DNA was removed and cDNA was synthesized by using NovoScript R Plus All-in-one 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix (gDNA Purge) (Novoprotein, Shanghai, China), and qRT-PCR analysis was performed as described previously (29) . Briefly, 1 µg of RNA from cells was transcribed into cDNA according to the instructions of the Superscript III Reverse Transcription kit. A total of 1 µl of cDNA was mixed with 5 µl of iQ5 SYBR Green Mix (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA), 3 µl of double-distilled water, and 0.5 µl each of forward and reverse primer. The cDNA was amplified and the cycle threshold (Cq) values were recorded. The cDNA concentration, primer sequence, and Q-PCR procedure applied for each gene in each cell type were the same. The basal expression level of each gene in each cell type was compared by directly determining from the Cq values according to the method used in the previous study (20) . The relative mRNA expression of each gene in each cell type was normalized to the expression level of the 18s mRNA gene ( CT CT [PRR or ISG]/ CT [18s]). Expression levels of induced mRNAs are presented as the fold change relative to mock-infection levels according to the 2 − CT method. All primer sequences are listed in Table 1 .  Blockage of IFNAR Signaling  In order to examine the impact of IFNAR signaling on the DPV replication in each cell type, the IFNAR-specific inhibitor, ruxolitinib, was applied. The cell toxicity of ruxolitinib at a dose of 1, 5, 10, and 20 µM/ml on each cell type was detected by MTT method. Duck DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages were pretreated with 5 µM/ml of ruxolitinib for 1 h and then infected with CHv or CHa at a MOI of 0.1 for 1 h. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, and the same concentration of ruxolitinib was added to the culture medium; DMSO was used as a mock control. The cell culture supernatant in each cell type was collected to detect the TCID 50 as above described. The cell was scraped in PBS from the plate to detect the viral genomic copy number.  Antiviral Assay  For the preventative antiviral assay, duck monocytes/ macrophages were pretreated with 20 µg/ml poly(dA:dT) or poly(I:C) for 12 h, sterile water was used as control, and then infected with CHv or CHa at a MOI of 0.1. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, and the same concentration of poly(dA:dT) or poly(I:C) was added to the culture medium and incubated for 24 h. For the therapeutic antiviral assay, duck monocytes/ macrophages were pretreated with 10 or 20 µg of poly(dA:dT) or poly(I:C) for 2 h and then infected with CHv or CHa at a MOI of 1.0. After infection, the analogs were added at the same concentration and incubated for 24 h. At 24 hpi, the cell culture supernatants were collected for TCID 50 determination, and the cells were washed with PBS, scraped from the dishes, and collected for viral genomic copy number determination as described above.  Statistical Analysis  Data are expressed as the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM), and the significance of differences between groups was evaluated using the Student's t-test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post-hoc test. Asterisks indicate the level of statistical significance ( * P < 0.05; * * P < 0.01; * * * P < 0.001; * * * * P < 0.00001). All experiments were repeated at least three times individually. Graphs were plotted and analyzed using GraphPad Prism software, version 6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).  Duck Primary Cells Isolation and Characterization  DEFs have been cultured in our lab using sophisticated methods for many years, and PBMCs were isolated using a duck leukocyte isolation kit; these two cell types were applied in our previous studied (30) . Hence, we strove to isolate and culture duck neurons, astrocytes, and monocytes/macrophages according to previous methods used for mouse and human cells. First and foremost, we isolated PBMCs from the duck whole blood cells (WBC) through density gradient centrifugation, the WBCs and PBMCs were stained with Wright Strain (Figure 1A) , and the results showed that there are mainly erythrocyte and little partial of thrombocytes and leucocytes in the WBCs. The leucocytes were above 95% in the PBMCs, and the monocytes were about 7% among the total PBMCs ( Figure 1A) . Since there is no duck-derived M-CSF on sale, we blast the duck's M-CSF protein sequence (31-177aa) with the human's M-CSF protein sequence, and found that the duck's M-CSF protein sequence has the same functional domain as the human M-CSF protein sequence (34-175aa) (data did not show); thus, we tried to stimulate the duck-derived PBMCs with human M-CSF, we observed and collected the time course and found that it can induce duck PBMCs to differentiate into macrophages, which were mainly composed of the wheel and spindleshaped cells (Figure 1B) . In our present method, the survival time of the PBMCs was not more than 72 h without M-CSF, so we believe that the obtained monocytes/macrophages were induced by human M-CSF. Since the antibodies (see below) we used to identify the macrophage-like cells we have obtained were against the surface molecules that are found in both monocytes and macrophages, we term the cells as monocytes/macrophages (MM).Under specific culture conditions, we successfully cultured duck primary neurons, astrocytes, and monocytes/macrophages and identified the cells using an IFA with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against MAP2 for neurons ( Figure 1C) , a rabbit polyclonal antibody against GFAP for astrocytes (Figure 1D) , and a mouse polyclonal antibody against CD80 and CD86 for monocytes/macrophages (Figure 1E) . To further identify the characteristics of monocytes/macrophages, we examined the expression of CD80 and CD86 through Western blot; the relative molecular weight was 38 and 40 kD, respectively ( Figure 1F) . The basal expression levels of TLR2, TLR4, CD80, and CD86 in these five types of cells were detected by Q-PCR and found that they were highly expressed in monocytes/macrophages (Figure 1E) . These results indicated that our methods can successfully isolate duck neuronal, astrocytes, and monocytes/macrophages. Duck Primary Cells Exhibited Differing Innate Immune Responses to DNA and RNA VirusesWe then examined whether the five types of duck primary cells we isolated were able to respond to DNA and RNA viruses by stimulating the cells with the DNA and RNA virus analogs, poly(dA:dT) or poly(I:C), respectively, at a dose of 5 µg/ml. At 24 h post-treatment, the expression of IFN-β (Figure 2A) was analyzed, and the data indicated that poly(dA:dT) induced significantly higher expression of IFN-β in astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages than did poly(I:C) or mock treatment. Poly(I:C) induced significantly higher levels of IFNβ expression in PBMCs and monocytes/macrophages compared with mock-treated cells.The expression level of MX, an ISG induced by IFN or pathogens, was examined in each of the five cell types, and the data showed that poly(I:C) induced significantly higher expression of MX in all tested cells (DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages) than did poly(dA:dT) or mock treatment (Figure 2B) . Under poly(dA:dT) stimulation, significant upregulation of MX expression was observed only in astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages. The expression of IL-6, an inflammatory factor, was also determined after stimulation (Figure 2C) , and the data showed that poly(I:C) induced IL-6 expression in all five types of duck cells. Although poly(dA:dT) induced IL-6 only in astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages, the levels were higher than those induced by poly(I:C). Taken together, these data indicated that the five types of duck primary cells we examined are competent to respond to DNA and RNA viruses and that innate immune signaling is initiated. Upon stimulation with DNA viruses, monocytes/macrophages exhibit higher levels of IFN-β, ISG, and inflammatory cytokine expression than DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, and PBMCs.  Basal Levels of Innate Immune Factors Differed in Duck Primary Cells  To elucidate the mechanisms associated with the different responses of the five types of duck primary cells to DNA and RNA virus analogs, the basal levels of innate immune factors were compared. We examined a variety of representative factors, including cGAS, STING, RIG-I, MDA5, IRF7, IFNβ, MX, and IL-6. The basal levels of cGAS were comparable among the different duck primary cells (Figure 3A) . The basal levels of STING, RIG-I, MDA5, IRF7, IFN-β, MX, and IL-6 were highest in monocytes/macrophages and lowest in astrocytes and DEFs (Figures 3B-H) . These results indicated that monocytes/macrophages mount a greater innate immune response than the other cell types after stimulation with DNA or RNA virus analogs.   Duck Cells Infected With Multi-Tropic DPV  DPV, the only herpes virus circulating in aquatic animals, exhibits multi-tropic infection, and the virus can be detected in nearly every major organ, including the brain, lung, spleen, intestines, and liver. In order to investigate the tropism of DPV in duck cells, duck DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages were infected with a recombinant virulent virus strain, CHv-GFP, at a low MOI of 0.01 (Figure 4) . Virus proliferation and morphology of the primary cells cultured in vitro were assessed by monitoring the expression of GFP. As the data demonstrate, at 24 h post-infection, GFP was clearly expressed in duck DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, and monocytes/macrophages, and all four types of virus-infected cells were radially enlarged at 48 h post-infection. No significant GFP expression was observed in DPV-infected PBMCs. These data demonstrated that DPV infects different types of duck cells in vitro and exhibits multi-tropic infection, with possible replication in many organs and tissues, such as muscle, brain (neurons and astrocytes), and spleen (monocytes/macrophages).  Virulent and Vaccine DPV Strains Grew Differently in Duck Primary Cells  To investigate the growth dynamics of DPV in the five types of duck primary cells, the cells were infected with a virulent DPV strain (CHv) or an attenuated vaccine strain (CHa) at a MOI of 0.01. The viral titer in the cell culture supernatant was determined based on the TCID 50 (Figures 5A-C) , and the intracellular viral genome copy number was also determined (Figures 5D-F) . CHa produced higher virus titer and genomic copy number than CHv in neurons and astrocytes at 24, 48, and 72 hpi. The viral titer and genome copy number of CHa were comparable to CHv at 24 hpi but higher than CHv at 48 and 72 hpi in PBMCs, although the values were near the detection limit. CHa produced higher viral genome copy number in DEFs at 24 hpi (Figure 5D ), but the viral titer was comparable at 24, 48, and 72 hpi (Figures 5A-C) . These data indicated that the attenuated strain of DPV replicates faster and produces more virus particles than the virulent strain in duck DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, and PBMCs.An intriguing finding was that the titers of both virus strains were comparable in monocytes/macrophages at 24 hpi ( Figure 5A) . The genomic copy number of CHa was significantly higher than that of CHv at 24 hpi ( Figure 5D ). The genomic copy number and viral titer of CHa slowly decreased between 48 and 72 hpi. In contrast, the genomic copy number and viral titer of CHv increased over this time period (Figures 5B,C,E,F) . The copy number and viral titer of CHa was significantly lower at 48 and 72 hpi compared with CHv (Figures 5B,C,E,F) . These data demonstrate that the attenuated strain (CHa) abortively infects duck monocytes/macrophages, whereas the virulent strain (CHv) persistently infects duck monocytes/macrophages, we speculate that the monocytes/macrophages may be able to kill the virus and it is an active immune response that is responsible for the decrease in viral titer of CHa strain, as we demonstrated in the experiments below.  The Innate Immune Response Was Inhibited by the Virulent DPV Strain but Activated by the Attenuated DPV Strain  To determine whether the different growth dynamics exhibited by the virulent and attenuated strains of DPV affected the innate immune response in duck primary cells, the expression levels of cGAS, STING, RIG-I, MDA5, IRF7, IFN-β, MX, and IL-6 were analyzed in the five types of duck primary cells infected with either the CHv strain or CHa strain at a MOI of 1.0. There were no significant differences in the expression of these molecules in the CHv-or CHa-infected DEFs or neurons at 6, 12, and 24 hpi, but there was a slight increase in expression in astrocytes infected with CHa (data did not show). In PBMCs, infection with the CHv strain induced cGAS, STING, MDA5, IRF7, IFN-β, MX, and IL-6 expression early, at 6 hpi, but expression decreased by 12 and 24 hpi (data did not show). Infection with the CHa strain induced a slight increase in the expression levels of these factors at 6 hpi, and the expression continued to increase with time and was significantly higher compared with CHv-infected cells or mocktreated cells. However, the CHv strain may not be able to infect PBMCs observed from Figures 4, 5 , and the virus level of the CHa strain infected with PBMCs is slightly higher than that of the CHv strain, so comparing the innate immune responses caused by the two in PBMCs are complicated.The expression levels of cGAS, STING, RIG-I, MDA5, IRF7, IFN-IFN-β, MX, and IL-6 were also examined in CHv-and CHainfected duck monocytes/macrophages. Similar to the changes observed in DPV-infected PBMCs, infection with CHv induced significant increases in the expression of cGAS, STING, RIG-I, MDA5, IRF7, IFN-β, and MX in monocytes/macrophages early, at 6 hpi, but expression rapidly decreased by 12, 24, 48, and 72 hpi (Figure 6) , a trend opposite to the growth curve on monocytes/macrophages (Figure 5) . Infection with the CHa strain induced significantly increased expression of cGAS, RIG-I, MDA5, IRF7, IFN-β, and MX in monocytes/macrophages at 6 hpi, and these levels were higher than those observed in mock-treated cells but lower than those in cells infected with CHv strain. The expression of cGAS, STING, RIG-I, MDA5, IRF7, IFN-β, MX, and IL-6 decreased slightly at 12 and 24 hpi, but then increased markedly at 48 and 72 hpi (Figure 6) . These data indicated that the virulent DPV strain activates the innate immune system in PBMCs and monocytes/macrophages during the early stages of infection, but then the innate immune response is downregulated once the virus begins to replicate. The attenuated strain (CHa) activates the innate immune system primarily during the later stages of infection, and this could be the reason why this strain abortively infects monocytes/macrophages and has been attenuated.  Blockage of IFNAR Signaling Enhanced CHa Strain Replication in Astrocytes, PBMCs, and Monocytes/Macrophages  To further investigate how DPV infection affects the innate immune response in the five types of duck primary cells, IFNAR signaling was blocked using the specific inhibitor ruxolitinib. We first examined whether ruxolitinib functions in the duck cells by pretreating DEFs with ruxolitinib for 1 h and then infecting the cells with a duck RNA virus, DTMUV, which belongs to the Flavivirus family and was demonstrated to induce strong innate immune response in DEF cells (30) . After infection, rucolitinib was added at the same concentration and the cells were incubated for 24 h. DTMUV induced significant expression of IFN-β, MX, and IL-6 in DEFs (Figures 7A-C) , but the expression levels of these factors were clearly reduced in cells treated with ruxolitinib, indicating that this inhibitor can be used to block IFNAR signaling in duck cells.The cell toxicity of ruxolitinib on DEFs (Figure 7D) , neurons, astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages was determined (data did not show), and no obvious cell viability was changed by ruxolitinib at a dose of 5 µM/ml on these five cell types. Ruxolitinib was used to treat duck DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages in further assays. Viral titer was examined at various time points in the culture supernatants of cells infected with either the CHv or CHa DPV strain, with and without ruxolitinib treatment. After ruxolitinib treatment for 24 hpi, the titer of CHa in the astrocyte culture supernatant was significantly increased, by ∼10-fold; however, at this time point, there were no obvious changes in CHa titer in the cell culture supernatants of DEFs, neurons, PBMCs, or monocytes/macrophages (Figure 7E) . At 24 hpi, no change in CHv titer was detected in any of the five duck primary cells (Figure 7E) . At 48 hpi, the titer of CHa was significantly increased in the cell culture supernatants of astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages (Figure 7F ). There was a certain increase observed in the culture supernatant of astrocytes infected with CHv. No changes were observed in the titers of either CHv or CHa in the supernatants of neurons and DEFs treated with ruxolitinib (Figures 7E,F) . Taken together, these data indicated that blockage of IFNAR signaling enhances the replication of the attenuated DPV strain (CHa) in duck astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages. Infection with CHa activates the type I IFN response in these cells to a greater degree than does infection with the CHv strain.  Priming Monocytes/Macrophages With an Agonist Restricted CHv Replication  Infection with the CHv or CHa strains of DPV had a differential effect on the innate immune response in duck primary cells. Both strains of DPV induced the most significant changes in the innate immune response in monocytes/macrophages (Figure 6) , and therefore monocytes/macrophages were chosen as a cell model to investigate the antiviral role of IFNAR signaling.Monocytes/macrophages were pretreated with poly(dA:dT) or poly(I:C) at a dose of 20 µg/ml for 12 h and then infected with the CHv or CHa strain at a MOI of 1.0. The viral titer and genomic copy number were determined at 24 hpi. The viral titer and genomic copy number of the CHv strain were significantly decreased in monocytes/macrophages pretreated with poly(dA:dT) or poly(I:C) (Figures 8A,B) , but there was no change in either viral titer or genomic copy number of the CHa strain (Figures 8C,D) .To assess the therapeutic antiviral effect of the agonists, monocytes/macrophages were pretreated with poly(dA:dT) or poly(I:C) at dose of 10 or 20 µg/ml for 2 h and then infected with either the CHv or CHa strain at a MOI of 1.0. After infection, the same concentration of poly(dA:dT) or poly(I:C) was added and the cells were incubated until the time point of examination. At 24 hpi, the viral titer and genomic copy number were determined. As the data showed, treating monocytes/macrophages with poly(dA:dT) at a dose of 10 µg/ml had no effect on viral titer or copy number of the CHv strain, but a significant reduction of viral titer and genomic copy number was observed at a dose of 20 µg/ml (Figures 8E,F) . Significant reductions in both viral titer and genomic copy number of the CHv strain were observed with monocytes/macrophages treated with poly(I:C) at a dose of either 10 or 20 µg/ml (Figures 8E,F) . For monocytes/macrophages infected with the CHa strain, treatment with poly(dA:dT) or poly(I:C) at a dose of either 10 or 20 µg/ml resulted in a reduction in viral genome copy number (Figure 8H ) but had no effect on viral titer (Figure 8G) . Taken together, these data indicate that activation of IFNAR signaling via a PRR agonist restricts the virulent strain of DPV. PRR agonists thus exhibit preventative and therapeutic potential against DPV infection.  DISCUSSION  In the current study, we isolated and cultured duck primary DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the culture of duck neurons, astrocytes, and monocytes/macrophages in vitro. These five types of duck primary cells were used to investigate the tropism of DPV and the innate immune response to DPV infection. We found that DPV persistently infected and replicated in DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, and monocytes/macrophages, indicating that DPV exhibits wide in vivo organ tropism in ducks (19) . Indicative of the potential of DPV to evade the innate immune response, and infection of DEFs, neurons, and astrocytes, there were slight changes in PRR and ISG expression. Upon infection of PBMCs and monocytes/macrophages at a high MOI, the CHv strain only upregulated the expression of some PRRs and ISGs at 6 hpi, but expression of these innate immunity factors was downregulated at later time points by the virulent DPV strain. A particularly intriguing finding was that the expression of PRRs and ISGs in PBMCs and monocytes/macrophages was consistently upregulated by infection with the attenuated vaccine strain (CHa). Monocytes/macrophages represent an ideal cell model for investigating the relationship between DPV infection and the innate immune response; as the virulent strain of DPV persistently infects monocytes/macrophages, these cells may play a critical role in the pathogenicity of the virus.The current lack of methods for culturing duck primary cells significantly hinders investigations of the role of each cell type in the infectious cycle, tropism, and pathogenicity of aquatic bird viruses, such as DPV, avian influenza virus, novel duck reovirus (NDRV), and DTMUV, which cause major economic losses in the duck industry (34) (35) (36) (37) . As opposed to RNA viruses such as avian influenza, NDRV, and DTMUV, DPV is a dsDNA virus that does not readily induce an innate immune response in DEFs. Hence, in order to investigate the mechanism by which the virus evades the innate immune response, a better primary cell model is needed. Numerous types of mammalian primary cells have been isolated from the tissues and successfully cultured, but there are few such reports regarding the culture of primary cells of aquatic animals such as ducks and geese. In the present study, we isolated and cultured duck neurons, astrocytes, and monocytes/macrophages using methods developed for mouse or human cells. Our data indicated that the synapses of neurons, the classic morphology, formed at 3 days post-induction. The expected star shape was clearly observed for duck astrocytes isolated from brain tissue and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS. It was surprising that we could induce the differentiation of wheel-shaped monocytes/macrophages from duck PBMCs using human or mouse M-CSF at a concentration of 50 ng/ml, and no living cells were detected at 7 days post-seeding in the absence of human or mouse M-CSF.As a herpesvirus, DPV sometimes exhibits chronic or latent infection in the duck trigeminal ganglion (TG) (38) , similar to HSV-1 (39) . Studies of the molecular mechanism of HSV-1 latency typically use mouse or rabbit animal models, but not humans. However, the research using an in vitro latency model in neurons would be a preferable approach prior to in vivo studies. Infection of stem-derived neurons with a low viral dose of wildtype HSV-1 in the presence of the antiviral agent acyclovir and interferon-alpha results in the establishment of a latent, nonproductive infection. In this state, viral replication and expression of late viral gene markers are not detected, but there is an accumulation of viral latency-associated transcript RNA (40) . In our current research, we isolated and cultured duck neurons, and both the virulent and attenuated strains of DPV were able to infect neurons in the absence of treatment with any antiviral drugs. This would be a good cell model for further studies of the molecular mechanism underlying latent DPV infection in neurons or investigations of how DPV invades the CNS to cause fever and intracranial swelling.Astrocytes are basal, functional cells of the CNS that form and maintain the permeability of the blood-brain barrier and restrict pathogen invasion (41, 42) . The TLR3 in astrocytes plays a critical role in containing the replication and transmission of HSV-1 in the CNS; deficiency of TLR3 causes astrocytes to become permissive to HSV-1 infection, thus facilitating infection of the entire CNS by HSV-1 (43) . IFNAR signaling in astrocytes exhibits regional differences that act to restrict the invasion of neurotropic viruses; loss of IFNAR signaling decreases the survival of mice after West Nile virus infection (44) . In our present study, we isolated and cultured duck astrocytes. The basal levels of innate immune factors in astrocytes were the lowest among the five types of duck primary cells we examined. Both strains of DPV infected astrocytes, and the titer of the attenuated strain (CHa) in astrocytes was comparable to that in DEFs. Blockage of IFNAR signaling increased DPV replication in astrocytes. Thus, astrocytes may play a critical role in containing DPV infection in the CNS and might therefore be a useful model. Further investigations of the role of astrocytes in DPV invasion and latent infection in the CNS are warranted.Persistent infection with HSV-1 is a prerequisite to this virus's pathogenicity, and HSV-1 has been reported to infect sensory neurons, the corneal epithelium, lymphocytes, and macrophages (45) . In the sensory ganglia, macrophages infiltrate the TG and produce TNF-α and iNOS to control the primary HSV-1 infection (46) . In human primary macrophages, knockdown of MDA5 and MAVS strongly inhibits the expression of IFN and TNF-α induced by HSV-1 entry and replication, indicating that the early innate recognition of HSV-1 involves MDA-/MAVS-dependent pathways (47) . The expression of chemokines such as CXCL10 and CCL3 in human monocytederived macrophages induced by HSV-1 infection involves IFI16dependent and IFI16-independent pathways (48) . Activation of IFNAR signaling promotes high ISGs expression in macrophages infected with HSV-1, in which SAMHD1 inhibits HSV-1 propagation by limiting viral DNA synthesis (49) . Abortive infection of viruses in astrocytes or macrophages appears to be essential to induce innate and adaptive immune responses to restrict or clear vesicular stomatitis virus, rabies virus, or influenza virus (29, 50, 51) . In our current study, monocytes/macrophages were infected by both strains of DPV, and the viral titer and copy number of the virulent strain (CHv) increased from 24 to 72 hpi at a MOI of 0.01. In contrast, the viral titer and genomic copy number of the attenuated strain (CHa) began to decrease early in the infection (Figure 5) . From these data, we inferred that the virulent strain (CHv) persistently infects the monocytes/macrophages, whereas the attenuated strain (CHa) causes an abortive infection in monocytes/macrophages. We further verified these observations by examining the innate immune response induced by these two strains. In duck monocytes/macrophages, the expression of PRRs and ISGs were induced by both strains at 6 hpi but gradually decreased in CHv-infected cells after 6 hpi ( Figure 6 ). However, in CHa-infected monocytes/macrophages, the expression of PRRs and ISGs were induced at 6 hpi and declined slightly at 12 and 24 hpi before rapidly increasing between 48 and 72 hpi (Figure 6 ). In the later time points of infection, the titer of the CHa strain was significantly lower than that of the CHv strain (Figure 5) . In the previous studies on DPV and MDV viruses, researchers observed the slight up-regulation of the innate immune molecules around 6 hpi in the fibroblasts, and the rapid down-regulation of these molecules from 12 hpi (23, 52) . These results are consistent with the data we obtained in this study; we hypothesized that DPV virulent strains have multiple, highly potent proteins that inhibit innate immunity, and the mechanism of suppressing innate immunity will be further studied in the future.Blockage of IFNAR signaling in monocytes/macrophages led to a marked increase in the titer of the CHa strain, but not that of the CHv strain (Figure 7) . Priming monocytes/macrophages with poly(dA:dT) or poly(I:C) selectively restricted the replication of the CHv strain (Figure 8) . The growth dynamics and innate immune response were similar in PBMCs. These data indicated that the CHv and CHa strains exhibit different replication patterns in monocytes/macrophages based on activation or inhibition of the innate immune response. This could explain why the CHa strain has been attenuated and provides protection from infection with the virulent DPV strain in ducklings. Monocytes/macrophages thus represent a promising cell model suitable for further studies of DPV pathogenicity and the mechanism of innate immune response evasion by DPV. In a recent study, the authors found that monocytes/macrophages are important target cells for DTMUV infection (53) . DTMUV successfully infects macrophages by subverting the innate immunity of monocytes/macrophages and transmits in the body using monocytes/macrophages as cell carriers. In that study, the authors separated lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages by washing the PBMCs at 2 and 24 h after plating and then used the cells for assays. Though the detection with antibodies against the hypothetical duck CD68 protein showed that the purity of monocytes/macrophages were greater than 85%, we think that it is difficult to obtain large numbers of macrophages from PBMCs if the monocytes are not induced with M-CSF or GM-CSF. Therefore, the duck monocytes/macrophages isolated in our study will provide an important cell manipulation platform for similar researches and obtain more direct experimental results and conclusions.In conclusion, we isolated and cultured primary duck DEFs, neurons, astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages. These five types of duck primary cells were able to respond to DNA and RNA virus stimulators and exhibited upregulated expression of PRRs and ISGs, thus demonstrating that they are useful cell models for deeper investigations of the induction/evasion of the innate immune response by aquatic animal viruses such as DPV. The virulent and attenuated strains of DPV infected these cells with differential replication dynamics, accompanied by differences in the innate immune response. Blockage of IFNAR signaling enhanced the replication of the attenuated strain of DPV in astrocytes, PBMCs, and monocytes/macrophages. Priming the IFNAR signaling pathway specifically reduced the titer of the virulent strain of DPV, indicating that the IFNAR signaling pathway plays a key role in limiting DPV infection. Persistent infection of monocytes/macrophages coupled with inhibition of the innate immune response represents an important junction in the pathogenicity of DPV.

31561274	Demographic and environmental drivers of metagenomic viral diversity in vampire bats	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7004108/	Viruses infect all forms of life and play critical roles as agents of disease, drivers of biochemical cycles and sources of genetic diversity for their hosts. Our understanding of viral diversity derives primarily from comparisons among host species, precluding insight into how intraspecific variation in host ecology affects viral communities or how predictable viral communities are across populations. Here we test spatial, demographic and environmental hypotheses explaining viral richness and community composition across populations of common vampire bats, which occur in diverse habitats of North, Central and South America. We demonstrate marked variation in viral communities that was not consistently predicted by a null model of declining community similarity with increasing spatial or genetic distances separating populations. We also find no evidence that larger bat colonies host greater viral diversity. Instead, viral diversity follows an elevational gradient, is enriched by juvenile‐biased age structure, and declines with local anthropogenic food resources as measured by livestock density. Our results establish the value of linking the modern influx of metagenomic sequence data with comparative ecology, reveal that snapshot views of viral diversity are unlikely to be representative at the species level, and affirm existing ecological theories that link host ecology not only to single pathogen dynamics but also to viral communities.		1							
22864629	Th2 Responses in OVA-Sensitized BALB/c Mice Are Down-Modulated By Mycobacterium bovis BCG Treatment	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086714/	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) treatment can reverse an established allergic airway inflammation in a BALB/c mouse model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced airway inflammation. METHODS: OVA sensitized BALB/c mice were challenged with aerosolized OVA on days 28 to 30, 34, 41 and 63. Mice were intranasal treated with BCG on days 35 and 42. Twenty-four hours after the last challenge, blood samples were collected to detect anti-OVA immunoglobulin isotypes, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was harvested for cell count. Additionally, lungs were collected for histological analysis, detection of the eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) activity and measurement of cytokines and CCL11. The expression of CTLA-4, Foxp3 and IL-10 was also determined in lung tissue by flow cytometry. RESULTS: BCG treatment was able to inhibit an established allergic Th2-response, by decreasing the allergen-induced eosinophilic inflammation, EPO activity, levels of CCL11 and IL-4, serum levels of IgE and IgG1. Mycobacteria treatment increased lung levels of IFN-γ, IL-10 and TGF-β, and expressions of Foxp3 and CTLA-4 in CD4(+)T cells. Additionally, an increased production of IL-10 by CD8(+) T cells was observed, even though no detectable changes in CD4(+)IL-10(+) was noticed. CONCLUSION: BCG treatment inhibits features of allergic airway inflammation and the results suggest that the mechanism underlying the down-regulatory effects of BCG on OVA-induced airway inflammation appear to be associated with the induction of both Th1 and T regulatory immune responses.	Introduction  Atopic asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness, reversible airway obstruction, lung inflammation, and high levels of allergen-specific IgE [1] . T helper 2 cells are thought to play a pivotal role in development of allergic response by the cytokines that they secrete, such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13, and chemokines, including CCL11, which play an important role in inflammatory cell recruitment [2] . These mediators contribute to the clinical features of allergic pathogeneses by triggering IgE production, eosinophil inflammation, mucus hypersecretion and bronchial hyperreactivity [3] .The increasing prevalence of allergic diseases and asthma, particularly in industrialized countries, has led to the hygiene hypothesis, which states that the newborn infant's immune system is skewed toward Th2 responses and needs timely and appropriate environmental stimulus to create a balanced immune response [4, 5] . Supporting this hypothesis, epidemiological and experimental evidence has shown an inverse correlation between Th1-induced microbial infections and allergic diseases [6] . Similarly, some animal studies have demonstrated that exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis or to environmental mycobacteria is able to protect against the development of allergic responses [7, 8] , introducing the concept that the administration of mycobacteria and their products may therefore be used as vaccines aimed at inhibiting Th2 responses. However the exact mechanism underlying this inhibition still remains poorly understood. Induction of Th1 cytokines, such as interferon-γ, has been suggested to cause a shift from Th2 to Th1 immune responses [9, 10] , thus subsequently preventing inflammatory allergic immune response. Nevertheless some results indicated that the immunological mechanism behind this inhibition it is much more complex than is predicted by this and additional non-Th1-Th2 immunological regulatory mechanism may play a much more prominent role [11] . In this context, some clinical and experimental studies have also highlighted the important role of regulatory T cells (Treg) in the control of allergic diseases, providing evidence that it works in a manner that is, in part, dependent on IL-10 or TGF-β or both [12] [13] [14] . Additionally, it has been well established that the transcription factor Foxp3, as well as the Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4), has a key role in the function of Treg cells [15, 16] and would be crucial to modulate an allergen-induced inflammation [17] . Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that treatment of newborn mice with Mycobacterium bovis-BCG or Mycobacterium vaccae before ovalbumin-sensitization was effective in reducing allergen induced-airway eosinophilia by giving rise to Treg cells [18] . On the other hand, some studies failed to show an effective suppression of allergic features after an allergen challenge [19] , suggesting that the therapeutic efficacy of BCG treatment in mouse models of allergy remains controversial. The present study aimed to evaluate the ability of BCG to suppress an established allergic response in a BALB/c mouse model of OVA-induced airway inflammation to achieve new insights into the mechanisms of how mycobacteria exert their anti-inflammatory effect.  Animals  Female BALB/c mice 6 to 8 weeks old were obtained from the Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora (UFJF) animal care facility and were housed in microisolator cages receiving chow and water ad libitum. Animals were grouped according to treatment as follows (n05): (a) PBS (sensitizations and airway challenges with phosphate-buffered saline); (b) BCG (sensitizations and airway challenges with PBS plus BCG treatment); (c) OVA (sensitizations and airway challenges with OVA); (d) OVA/BCG (sensitizations and airway challenges with OVA plus BCG treatment). All animal experimentation was in accordance with the principles of Brazilian Code for the Use of Laboratory Animals and was approved by UFJF Ethics Committee on the use of laboratory animals (CEEA-UFJF No. 027/2008).  Ovalbumin-Induced Airway Inflammation and BCG Treatment  Mice were sensitized intraperitoneally (i.p.) on days 0 and 14 with 3 μg of OVA (Grade V, Sigma-Aldrich Corp., USA) in 1 mg of alum (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., USA). Animals were challenged for 20 min with aerosolized OVA 1 % or PBS (Inalatec Plus, Nevoni, Brazil) on days 28 to 30, 34, 41 and 63. Mice were twice intranasal treated on days 35 and 42 with 50 μL of 2×10 6 CFU/mL of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (Moreau substrain, Ataupho de Paiva Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) or PBS (Fig. 1) .  Collection of Blood, Bronchoalveolar Lavage and Lung Samples  Twenty-four hours after the last OVA challenge mice were anesthetized i.p. with a solution of ketamine (90 mg/kg, Syntec, Brazil) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, Calmiun, Agener União, Brazil) and exsanguinated via the brachial plexus. The blood samples were centrifuged at 7,500 x g for 2 min (Centrifuge 5410, Eppendorf, Germany), and the serum was separated and stored at -20°C. Subsequently, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed by intratracheal instillation of 1 mL of PBS three times and cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of PBS containing 2 % fetal bovine serum. Then the chest cavity was opened to remove the lung lobes.  Total and Specific Cell Counts in BAL  Total leukocytes count was determined and percentages of a differential count of 300 leukocytes in BAL were determined using standard morphological criteria, examining cytospin slides (Fanem 248, Brazil) by Panoptic staining (Laborclin Ltda, Pinhais, Brazil).  Eosinophil Peroxidase Activity  For determination of eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) activity 100 mg of lung tissue was homogenized in 1.9 mL PBS, and centrifuged at 12,000 x g (Jouan, Thermo Electron Corporation, USA) for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was suspended in 1.9 mL of 0.5 % HTAB in PBS. The samples were frozen three times in liquid nitrogen and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C (Thermo Electron CR312, USA). The supernatant was used in the enzymatic assay. Briefly, 1.5 mL of o-phenyldiamine (OPD) solution was added to 8.5 mL of tris buffer, followed by the addition of 7.5 μL of H 2 O 2 . Using a 96-well plate 100 μL of substrate solution was added to 50 μL of each sample. After 30 min, the reaction was stopped with 50 μL of H 2 SO 4 1 M and the absorbance measured at 492 nm in a microplate reader (SPECTRAMAX 190, Molecular Devices, USA).  Measurement of Cytokines and Chemokine Levels in Lungs  In order to evaluate the levels of cytokines and chemokine in lung tissues, 100 mg of tissue was homogenized in 1 mL of PBS containing protease inhibitors (0.1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM benzethonium chloride, 10 mM EDTA and 2 μL of aprotinin A) and 0.05 % Tween 20. Samples were then centrifuged for 15 min at 500 x g (Thermo Electron CR312, USA) and the levels of cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IFN-γ, TGF-β and IL-10) and the chemokine CCL11 in supernatants were measured using commercially available ELISA kits (OptEIA, BD Bioscience for cytokines and R&D Diagnostics for chemokines), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.  Measurement of Anti-OVA-Specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG2a Antibodies  Quantification of anti-OVA-specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies was determined by ELISA. Briefly, 96-wells plates were sensitized with ovalbumin (10 μg/mL) and incubated for 18 h at 4°C. The plates were washed with 0.05 % Tween 20-PBS (PBST) and blocked with 10 % fetal bovine serum-PBST for 2 h at room temperature. The plates were washed with PBST and 50 μL of each serum (1:20 for IgE, and 1:100 dilutions for IgG1 and IgG2a) was added per well, and incubated for 18 h at 4°C. The plates were then washed and biotin-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgE, IgG1 or IgG2a (1:1,000; Pharmingen, BD Bioscience) was added. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature a substrate solution containing 0.1 M citric acid, 0.2 M sodium phosphate, distilled water, OPD, and 0.03 % hydrogen peroxide was added. The reaction was stopped with H 2 SO 4 1 M and the optical density measured at 492 nm in a microplate reader (Spectramax 190; Molecular Devices).  Cell Staining and Flow Cytometry  The lungs were removed and mashed through a 70 μm cell strainer. The red blood cells were lysed with ACK buffer and the cell suspension was washed twice in RPMI 1640 and adjusted to 1×10 6 cells per well. Cells were then stained with florescence-conjugated antibodies for cell surface markers, including PerCP-anti-CD4, PerCP-anti-CD8 and PE-anti-CD152 (all BD Bioscience-Pharmingen). For Foxp3 and IL-10 expression measurement, the cells were collected and stained for cell surface markers (CD4, CD8) without stimulation as described by the manufacturer's instructions. After surface marker staining, cells were permeabilized and stained with PE-anti-IL-10 and Alexa Fluor 488-anti-Foxp3 (BD Bioscience-Pharmingen). Data acquisition was performed using FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Data analysis was performed using FCS Express software (De Novo).  Lung Pathology  The right upper lung lobe of each animal was fixed in 10 % buffered formalin and the samples were submitted to routine histologic processing. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and examined in blinded fashion on an optical microscope (Zeiss, Hallbergmoos, Germany) at 50 x, 100 x and 400 x magnification. The peribronchiolar area was scored on a scale from 0 to 5: 0, no inflammation; 1, a few inflammatory cells; 2, a layer of inflammatory cells around the structure evaluated; 3, ring of inflammatory cells containing 2 to 4 layers; 4, focal inflammatory cells clustered around the structure; 5, intense inflammatory infiltrate [20] . PAS-positive goblet cells were quantified per 100 μm 2 of the PAS stained lungs.  Statistical Analysis  All statistical analysis were performed using Graph Pad prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Numerical data were analyzed by the normality test of Kolmogorov-Smirnov. Subsequently, the unpaired t test was used for parametric data and the Mann Whitney test for nonparametric data. The significance level accepted for the tests was P ≤0.05. Data are expressed as mean and standard error (mean±SE).  BCG Treatment Modulates OVA-Induced Airway Inflammation in a BALB/c Mouse Allergy Model  In order to address whether intranasal BCG treatment was able to reduce the airway inflammation, the number of total cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages was counted in BAL. EPO activity and CCL11 levels were analyzed in the lungs as an indirect measurement of eosinophil infiltration in this organ. The BCG treatment significantly reduced the infiltration of total cells in BAL (Fig. 2a) as well as the eosinophilic inflammation (Fig. 2b) , compared with the OVA group. However, the count of neutrophils did not change between the OVA and the OVA/BCG group (2c). The numbers (Fig. 2a, b, c, d and e) . As regards EPO and CCL11, the BCGtreated allergic mice showed a decrease in EPO activity and CCL11 levels compared with the OVA group ( Fig. 2f and g) .  Cellular Infiltration of Peribronchial Area and Mucus Production Are Inhibited with BCG Treatment  Lung sections were inspected for an overall semiquantitative score of inflammation and mucus production. Ovalbumin sensitization and subsequent airway challenge resulted in intense peribronchial and perivascular inflammatory infiltrates and a mean score of 4 was assigned to the OVA group. When compared with the OVA group, the BCG-treated allergic mice showed reduced inflammatory cell infiltrate (Fig. 3a and c) and mucus production (Fig. 3b) , which was confirmed by morphometry analysis with mucus cell counts (Fig. 3d) . BCG treatment had no effect on the lung tissue of non-allergic mice, and a mean score less than 1 was assigned to this grooup.  Improvement of Airway Inflammation by BCG Treatment Correlates with Immunoglobulin Isotype Shift from OVA-Specific IgE and IgG1  The serum levels of OVA-specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG2a were measured by ELISA. Significantly higher anti-OVA IgE and IgG1 levels were observed in the OVA group compared with the PBS group or the BCG group, indicating allergic immunization of these animals. M. bovis BCG treatment of allergic mice significantly downregulated anti-OVA IgE and IgG1 serum levels ( Fig. 4a and b) . Additionally, the OVA-specific IgG2a levels in the BCG-treated allergic group were higher than those observed in the OVA group (Fig. 4c) .   BCG Treatment Drives an Established Th2 Inflammatory Response Towards a Th1 and T Regulatory Cytokine Production  To determine the manner in which BCG treatment could influence cytokine secretion in the inflammatory site, ELISA was conducted for IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IFN-γ, TGFβ and IL-10. The BCG treatment of allergic mice resulted in a significant reduction of IL-4 and IL-13 levels (Fig. 5a and c) . Also, compared with the OVA group, the BCG-treated allergic group exhibited a significant increase in the levels of IFN-γ, TGF-β and IL-10 (Fig. 5d , e and f). Consistent with these findings, the BCG group showed increased IFN-γ and TGF-β levels, although the other cytokine levels did not alter. In addition, BCG-treated allergic mice had a slightly reduced IL-5 level compared with the OVA group (Fig. 5b) . In order to determine the role of regulatory T cells in a BCGinduced inhibitory effect, the expression of Foxp3 and CTLA-4 by CD4 + T cells was evaluated in the lungs of allergic mice. The BCG-treated mice had a significantly larger number of cells expressing CD4 + Foxp3 + , compared with the OVA group (Fig. 6a) . Additionally, an increase in the number of CD4 + CD152 + T cells was also observed in BCG-treated allergic mice (Fig. 6b) . Consistent with these results, the BCG group showed an increased expression of Foxp3 and CTLA-4 (CD152) by CD4 + T cells, when compared with the PBS group ( Fig. 6a and b) .  BCG Treatment Induces IL-10-Producing CD8 + T Cells in the Lungs  To further investigate whether the reduced allergen-induced airway inflammation observed in the BCG-treated allergic mice was associated with IL-10-producing regulatory T cells, the intracellular production of this cytokine by lung cells was analyzed. Intriguingly, although the BCG administration to allergic mice did not alter the number of CD4 + IL-10 + T cells, a significantly greater number of CD8 + IL-10 + T cells were observed (Fig. 6c and d) . Interestingly, BCG treatment of non-allergic mice was able to induce significantly IL-10 expression in both CD4+ and CD8 + T cells.  Discussion  The recent increase in the prevalence of allergic disorders, particularly in industrialized countries, provides support for the additional role of environmental factors in the pathogenesis of immune hypersensitivity [21] . Indeed, epidemiological evidence suggests that there is an inverse correlation between the immune response to viral and bacterial infections and the development and prevalence of allergic diseases [6] . In this context, many experimental studies showed that Mycobacterium bovis-Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-and other mycobacteria are effective in preventing allergic and asthmatic responses, probably through Th1 or regulatory T-cell immune responses [18, [22] [23] [24] . However, the therapeutic efficacy of BCG treatment on allergic airway inflammation after allergen challenge remains poorly understood and controversial. In the current study, the effect of giving BCG to mice with previous exposure to allergen was evaluated. The results showed that the mycobacteria treatment was able to inhibit the OVA-induced airway inflammation by reducing the mainly pathogenic allergic features, such as airway eosinophilic inflammation, IgE/ IgG1 production by B cells, type 2 cytokine productions and mucus hypersecretion. The reduction of airway pathogenesis to allergen was associated with a switch from Th2-type immune response towards to both Th1 and regulatory T immune responses. Interestingly, the intranasal BCG administration recruited CD4 + T cells expressing Foxp3 and CTLA-4 to the lungs accompanied by an increase in IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells. The protective properties of BCG vaccination were thought to lie mainly in its ability to induce effector CD4 and CD8 T cell responses which secrete cytokines including IFN-γ [25, 26] . In the same way, BCG-driven IFN-γ production has been proposed to shift allergen-specific responses from the Th2 to the Th1 phenotype, subsequently inhibiting the airway inflammatory immune response [27] . In keeping with preview studies [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] , the present results demonstrated that the improvement of airway inflammation was correlated with an increased IFN-γ production and this was associated with suppression of IL-4, as well with a relevant IgE and IgG1 shift towards to IgG2a protective isotype production. Altogether, these results suggest that, in this allergy model, IFN-γ had an important role as a master regulator of Th2 immune response since it has been well established that this cytokine exerts direct inhibitory effects on Th2 [33] as well as inducing IgG2a instead of IgE production by B cells [34] . On the other hand some studies have demonstrated that treatment with mycobacteria conferred protection against allergen lung inflammation by a mechanism independent of IFN-γ [22, 35] . Probably, this observed apparent discrepancy is due to differences in study design, particularly with regard to the temporal relationship between mycobacteria treatments and allergen exposure.Besides its Th1 inducer effect, it has been extensively shown that mycobacteria treatment is still able to increase IL-10 and TGF-β production [35] [36] [37] and it would be another mechanism by which BCG suppresses the inflammatory processes in mouse model of allergy. In this context, it has been demonstrated that heat-killed M. vaccae treatment improves the pulmonary inflammation without inducing Th1 response [18, 24] . Instead, the protective effect was associated with an induction of CD4 + CD45RB low Treg cells that secrete IL-10 and TGF-β and upon transfer could protect recipient allergic mice from airway inflammation [11] .In line with these findings, the increased levels of IL-10 and TGF-β found in the present study supported the idea that Treg cells have been involved in the BCG-induced inhibitory effect. Therefore, aimed at confirming whether the BCGmodulator effect was associated with inducing of Treg cells, the expression of Foxp3 and CTLA-4 by CD4 + T cells was investigated. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that both Foxp3 and CTLA-4 expression were up-regulated in allergic BCG-treated mice, suggesting that cell-cell contact inhibition may be involved in the regulatory mechanism, in addition to the action of IL-10 and TGF-β. These results are similar to those of an earlier study, although the authors of that study evaluated the preventive effect of a neonatal BCG vaccination in inhibiting an allergic eosinophilic inflammation induced in C57BL/6 mice [18] , while the present study assessed the ability of BCG to ameliorate an established allergic response in high Th2 responder BALB/c mice. In this respect, the findings are encouraging because modulation of established allergic T-cell responses is a challenge and more difficult than modulating primary responses [38] .Addicionally, an important finding of the current study is that IL-10 production by CD4 + T cells did not change in allergic mice after the BCG treatment, suggesting that other immune cell subsets may be involved in this BCG-induced regulation.Given the key role of dendritic cells (DCs) in driving and maintaining immune responses to inhaled allergen, it may be possible that mycobacteria interfere with DC-driven Th2cell sensitization. Indeed, it has recently been demonstrated that CD8α + and CD8α -DCs subsets from BCG-infected mice produced IL-12 and IL-10 respectively, and the BCGmodulating effect was mediated by both immune deviation and regulation [39] . These data suggest that DCs should be an important coordinator of different BCG-induced allergy inhibition, raising the possibility that DCs might also be a prominent source of the IL-10 detected in this present work. Therefore, further study aimed at evaluating the effect of intra-nasal BCG treatment on DCs activation would be very helpful for understanding the mechanisms by which mycobacteria inhibits allergic inflammation. Finally, since recent reports have shown that CD8 + T lymphocytes may play an important regulatory activity [40] , the involvement of these cells was investigated. Surprisingly, the analysis revealed that CD8 + T cells from allergic mice had their IL-10 production increased after BCG administration, suggesting that these cells could be important in dampening down the allergeninduced lung inflammation. In the last few years, some studies have been carried out to shed light on the role of CD8 + T cells in the induction and regulation of inflammatory responses. Recently, it was demonstrated that CD8 + T cell-derived IL-10 diminished disease severity in mice with coronavirus-induced acute encephalitis [40] . In parallel, other studies have shown that the transfer of activated CD8 + T cells from sensitized mice reduces the production of allergen-specific IgE and the development of airway hyperactivity [41, 42] . These regulatory CD8 + T cells could exert their inhibitory effects directly by killing immune cells or indirectly by secreting IL-10 and TGFβ [43, 44] . According to these findings, preview research provided evidence that systemic immunization with allergen induces regulatory CD8 + T cells which were able to inhibit the development of allergic diarrhea by a mechanism that involves IL-10 expression [45] .In spite of these existing correlations, the contribution of CD8 + T cells in the development of allergic airway inflammation remains inconclusive. It was demonstrated that depletion of CD8 + T cells in an early stage of sensitization prevented the development of eosinophilic airway infiltration and allergeninduced airway hyperreactivity [46] , but once systemic sensitization is established, CD8 + T cells may play a bystander or pro-inflammatory role in the development of allergic airway disease, since they exhibited a high capacity to produce Th2 cytokines, even though high amounts of IL-10 have been detectable [47] . Therefore, further study in this respect will be helpful for comprehensive elucidation of the role of CD8 + T cell subsets in allergic airway pathogeneses, particularly the relationship between the BCG modulator effect and the induction of regulatory CD8 + T cells.  Conclusions  In conclusion, this study demonstrates that intra-nasal BCG treatment is capable of enhancing an established allergendriven inflammatory response by markedly hindering the development of the Th2-dependent downstream effector phase of allergy. The results showed evidence of the coexistence of immune deviation and regulatory mechanisms for the modulating effect on Th2-airway inflammation by BCG. The increased production of IFN-γ, IL-10 and TGF-β associated with a higher Foxp3 and CTLA-4 expression seemed to be decisive in this inhibitory effect. Moreover, mycobacteria treatment induces IL-10 production by CD8 + T cells, suggesting participation of other important regulating mechanisms in addition to CD4 + T regulatory cells. Although a therapeutic role for BCG is compatible with the current version of the hygiene hypothesis, analysis of this hypothesis is in progress and the exact mechanism of how BCG exerts its effects remains open. Therefore, further studies should be carried out to elucidate whether it will be possible to use mycobacteria selectively to induce allergen-specific T regulatory cells. Furthermore, new insights into the mechanisms of action of BCG treatment should help to understand the abnormalities of the immune response resulting in allergic diseases.  			1		1			
3933936	Histology of colitis:Saguinus oedipus oedipus and other marmosets	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087924/		  A chronic colitis which ulcerates is a common, almost universal finding in the 11 species and hybrids of the 1584 Callitrichidae we have necropsied and studied histologically since 1966. In Table 1 the number of necropsies we have done are tabulated by calendar year by species. The variable numbers reflect largely population changes in species that have comprised the marmoset research colony over the years. For example, up until 1979, Saguinus fuscicoIlis illigeri and related subspecies (the socalled white-lipped tamarins) were the most numerous animals under study; they have been outnumbered by Saguinus oedipus oedipus (the cotton-top tamarin) only since 1975, when the S. f. subspecies were purposely reduced in numbers to permit an increase in the number of cotton-tops available for study. The table also shows the colony census of live animals by species on April 1, 1984 , and the total numbers of each species necropsied. This paper, describing the histology of marmoset colitis, rests principally upon 764 S. f. illigeri, 290 S. f. subspecies, 352 S. o. oedipus, and 138 CaUithrix jacchus (the common marmoset) necropsy observations. TECHNIQUES Complete necropsies were done as soon as possible after death. Only rarely was a dead animal not examined both grossly and microscopically. From 1966 to 1976, all tissues were fixed in Gomori's 1-2-3 fixative, and after 1976 in 10% neutral formalin. Fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin and 4 to 6 p~m sections were cut and routinely stained with PAS-hematoxylin (2). In Table 2 the principal necropsy prosectors are listed chronologically.The histopathology of colitis in these species resembles that found in human colitis except for the absence of hyperchromatic nuclear dysplastic changes (3) . The stages or phases of the marmoset 7  14  21  8  16  20  16  10  8  14  3  11  3 13  4 --179  22   28 49  63 42  49  74  58  30 14  35 20  17  7 28 25 --585  52  15  6 16  26 30  5 17 11 12 --138  63  22 10  13  12  3  2 --1 --1 --1  98  1  8  3  2  1  4 --2  2  1  1  32  0  3  3 disease that are histologically distinguishable are:(1) simple acute colitis, (2) acute (abscessive) ulcerative colitis, (3) reparative (subsiding, or subacute) colitis, (4) chronic colitis, and (5) recurrent acute colitis with persistent chronic colitis. Simple Acute Colitis. This entity is seen only in young, previously healthy animals and rarely in adult animals dying unexpectedly in the large, roomy, breeding facility where the clinical incidence of acute colitis is minimal. The histology resembles that of so-called, acute, self-limited colitis or acute infectious-type colitis (4). The mucosal changes are typically those of an acute infection: edema, hemorrhage, and leukocytic exudation and infiltration of the lamina propria. Recent ulcerations may be present. Signs of repair and lymphocytic infiltration are minimum. The glands are straight and "test-tube" like. When crypt abscesses are seen, they are accompanied by depletion of mucin production and decreased mitotic activity.Apparently no animals died or were necropsied in the subacute or resolution phase of this acute process because no specimens were found with this kind colitis is recognizable histologically by its great variability throughout the colon. It is present in its most florid form in the cecum and ascending colon where the mucosa is edematous, hyperemic, hemorrhagic, and hypercellular. The lamina propria is variably rich in granulocytes, lymphocytes, and plasmacytes. Acute cryptitis, crypt abscesses, and large intramucosal abscesses are present. The acute granulocytic infiltrations of the crypts are accompanied by lysis of the epithelial cells, which are usually hyperplastic and devoid of mucin production. These mucosal changes are often paralleled by the accumulation of large lymphoid masses below the muscularis mucosae in the submucosa. These often reach sufficient size to appear like Peyer's patche s . Subaeute Colitis. In the next histologic type of colonic inflammation (subacute colitis), reparative changes are most prominent. The glands show greatly increased mitotic activity, tortuosity, and an increase in the height of the columnar cells. The denuded lamina propria (superficial ulcerations) is covered by new sheets of low cuboidal (squamoid) epithelium. The epithelium in the necks of the glands is rich in mucin-producing cells, such that obstruction of the glandular lumen by dystrophic goblet cells and mucin results. Although mucosal fibroplasia is minimal, it does occur in some areas where the glandular epithelium was lost in the acute phase. In the absence of fibroplasia and collagen deposition in such areas, the lamina propria becomes richly infiltrated by lymphocytes which seem to differentiate in the deeper layer of the mucosa into plasmacytes and reticular macrophages ( Figure  1 ). In the reparative exuberance of the crypts in these areas, budding of their deepest tips occurs, producing boot-shaped deformities. These hyperplastic buds proliferate and penetrate through the muscularis mucosae at vascular clefts (Figure 2 and 3) Here nuclear crowding and pleomorphism are found.Chronic Ulcerative Colitis. In this phase of the process, the typical histologic picture of chronic ulcerative colitis is produced (5): a greatly thickened mucosa composed of long, irregular glandular crypts that are rich in enlarged, dystrophic goblet cells separated by a densely cellular lymphocytic exudate, plasmacytes, and reticular macrophages. In some cases, this inflammatory response extends through the muscularis mucosae in such volume that the muscularis appears to have been pushed up into the mucosa. This illusion is heightened by hyperplastic epithelial downgrowths into the submucosa where atrophic epithelial lined spaces are formed in the center of masses of lymphocytes. These spaces can become filled with cellular detritus, inflammatory exudate, and mucin, forming large submucosal structures communicating with the intestinal lumen by wide fistulous ducts ( Figure  4) .Recurrent Acute Colitis with Persistent Chronic Colitis. The chronic colitic picture is altered, apparently, by recurrent episodes of acute colitis which superimpose such changes as cryptitis, crypt abscess, mucosal abscess, and ulceration upon the residual chronic changes. At necropsy of aged animals, 'none have been found with completely normal colons or atrophic, cell-poor, Scarred ones; this observation leads us to believe that this chronic ulcerating colitis does not completely repair or become quiescent in these animals.  SEARCH FOR DYSPLASTIC CHANGES  A question basic to the applicability of this animal model to studies of the etiology of colon cancer is whether, in this ubiquitous chronic colitis, there are cellular changes which can be construed as being preneop!astic (6) . Answering this question would seem at first glance not to be too difficult since only one (S. o. oedipus) of the three marmoset species examined extensively (over 20 years of observation) has developed colonic carcinoma, whereas all three species have extensive chronic colitis. Our preliminary study of this problem involved reviewing the histopathologic changes found in all animals coming to necropsy over the last 20 years. To structure our search, we leaned heavily upon the recently published (Table 1 , page 958 in that publication) was used as the guideline throughout our search. Rather quickly it became apparent that "dysplasia" as defined in this study of human biopsy material is not found in entire colons obtained at necropsy of marmosets with chronic colitis even when in situ or invasive carcinomas were present. Our modification of the IBD group's classification schema to include a numerical grade 4 for carcinoma was not a practical solution since the "positive grades 2 and 3 for low-and high-grade dysplasia" could not be used to grade our histologic preparations. Since our material is routinely fixed in formalin which "causes nuclear chromatin to appear relatively condensed" (p. 964, ref. 2), the absence of hyperchromatism in the basal portion of the crypts in marmoset colons cannot be explained as a histologic artifact.One explanation could be that in marmosets the dysplastic stage identified in human colonic neoplastic transformation is missing. Instead, at a stage of reparative epithelial hyperplasia marked by cellular crowding, nuclear pleomorphism, and stratification (but no hyperchromatism), neoplastic transformation is present but not in a histologically recognizable form. It is common in marmosets to find in situ, poorly differentiated carcinoma cells surrounding hyperplastic crypts and with tubular glands appearing to be embedded in them. Occasionally the basal portions of such hyperplastic crypts show loss of basement membrane and spread of poorly differentiated cells into adjacent lamina propria. Such areas are considered by us to be microscopic, malignant foci or a breakout of already transformed cells.Another form of this peculiar neoplastic cellular proliferation was recognized by Dr. Yardley (this workshop) studying the microslides of our recent cases of marmosets with colonic adenocarcinoma. This lesion ( Figure 5 ) shows how this abrupt neoplastic transformation can occur intraglandularly even when there is no destruction of the basement membrane of the crypt. It illustrates well the absence in this animal of a dysplastic stage as described in terms of human surgical pathology (3, 6) . The cancer cells are seen in this photomicrograph to be budding into the lumen from a low cuboidal epithelium which shows pleomorphic nuclei and little mucin production. The basilar lumen of this crypt contains shed neoplastic cells. The bases of two crypts to the left in the figure show the disarrangement and pleomorphism characteristic of the chronic colitic changes which are associated with this neoplastic transformation. Other glands to the right are more orderly but quite hyperplastic. The noncancerous glandular epithelium in the elongated hyperplastic glands displays extreme dystrophic mucin production. These glands are o n l y slightly tortuous here, but they may be distorted and branching. The edematous stroma of the lamina propria contains slightly increased numbers of lymphocytes but only a few plasmacytes and reticular macrophages. This lesion is present in 10 other sites in this section. Because of this intraluminal origin, this specimen is considered histopathologic proof of the polyclonal nature of colonic carcinogenesis of this species. Unfortunately, it still leaves the preneoplastic change unidentified and undescribedo  DISCUSSION  The marmoset colon cancer model would not seem to be readily applicable to studies of the relationships between intestinal polyposis and hyperchromatic dysplastic colitic changes and colon cancer development. It could prove, however, to be a simplistic model for studying chronic colitis p e r se and its precursor role, if any, in colonic carcinogenesis (5) [Chalifoux (8) , this workshop].The absences of a precancerous polypoid stage and a histologically demonstrable dysplastic stage are provocative in themselves. Clearly, however, for the marmoset to be used as a model for studying either colonic cancer or chronic colitis, the incidence of spontaneous colitis must be reduced and the disease controlled or prevented; thus normal colon morphology and function could be made the starting point for prospective experimental designs. The increasingly proficient breeding of these animals assures successful outbreeding for genetic studies in the future. New synthetic, easily controllable, appetizing diets, designed especially for these animals, encourage our plan to control these spontaneous colonic diseases not only for the purposes of experimental research but also for the preservation of the cotton-top tamarin, an endangered species [Clapp et al (7), this workshop].In all of these studies, competent necropsies and histopathologic studies will be necessary to provide guidelines for experimental designing and hypothesis generation.

31062116	Improving an Escherichia coli-based biocatalyst for terpenol glycosylation by variation of the expression system	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088306/	Glycosides are becoming increasingly more relevant for various industries as low-cost whole-cell-biocatalysts are now available for the manufacture of glycosides. However, there is still a need to optimize the biocatalysts. The aim of this work was to increase the titre of terpenyl glucosides in biotransformation assays with E. coli expressing VvGT14ao, a glycosyltransferase gene from grape (Vitis vinifera). Seven expression plasmids differing in the resistance gene, origin of replication, promoter sequence, and fusion protein tag were generated and transformed into four different E. coli expression strains, resulting in 18 strains that were tested for glycosylation efficiency with terpenols and a phenol. E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-SUMO_VvGT14ao yielded the highest titres. The product concentration was improved 8.6-fold compared with E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS/pET29a_VvGT14ao. The selection of a small solubility-enhancing protein tag and exploitation of the T7 polymerase-induction system allowed the formation of increased levels of functional recombinant protein, thereby improving the performance of the whole-cell biocatalyst.

Introduction  Enzymes offer tremendous opportunities for the chemical industry as they can efficiently and economically convert molecules and replace well-known and established industrial processes with more sustainable ones. Traditionally, enzymes are used by food and feed industry, but are increasingly implemented in emerging markets such as pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries [18] . The production of catalytically active proteins in heterologous microbial and fungal hosts leads to lower costs and high yields, which is crucial for the economy of an industrial process. Escherichia coli is the host of choice if post-translational modifications of the enzyme are not required for its activity [19] . The use of E. coli as whole-cell biocatalyst offers additional benefits such as cofactor regeneration, high catalytic efficiency and mild and simple reaction conditions [24] . However, the production of misfolded and inactive aggregates such as inclusion bodies is problematic when recombinant proteins are over-expressed in bacteria. Strategies for overcoming this disadvantage of heterologous expression are the optimization of the expression system, e.g. by using tightly regulated promoters or by attaching solubility-enhancing fusion tags. When using whole-cell biocatalysts for biocatalysis, substrate and product transmembrane transport and cofactor regeneration capacity of the used strain must similarly be considered. For the moment, the most promising method for whole-cell biocatalysis seems to be the use of engineered E. coli, which offers the potential for large-scale and costeffective production.Glycosylation plays a central role in cellular communication, transport and storage of metabolites in organisms. Recently, the glycosylation reaction has attracted much attention because volatility, poor water solubility and instability limit the application of many small molecules in consumer products [7, 28] . The transfer of sugars to small molecules makes them non-volatile, more water-soluble and improves their stability, bioavailability and functionality. Volatile terpenols become non-volatile by glycosylation, Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (https ://doi.org/10.1007/s1029 5-019-02184 -4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. allowing them to be applied as slow release aroma chemicals [29] and the water solubility of resveratrol increases by a factor of 1700 when sugars are attached, which results in improved bioavailability [21] . Glycosylated vitamin C and anthocyanidins are more stable than their non-glycosylated precursors [38, 39] , alteration of the sugar residues of quercetin affects pharmacological properties [17] , and transfer of sugars to the diterpenol steviol results in sweet tasting steviosides [10] .In nature, glycosylation reactions are primarily catalysed by nucleotide-sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases [30] . These enzymes transfer carbohydrate residues from activated sugar donors to a multitude of acceptor molecules, including proteins, saccharides, lipids and small molecules. Glycosylation of their -OH, -NH 2 , -SH, and -COOH groups results in O-, N-, S-glucosides, and sugar esters, respectively [16] . Uridine diphosphate sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGT) form the largest group and are characterized by a unique C-terminal consensus sequence representing the sugar donor site [22] . Plant genomes are rich sources for UGT genes, which code, among others for biocatalysts that can transfer sugars to small molecules and on-going sequencing projects continuously deliver new nucleotide sequences (http://supfa m.org/). These UGTs are capable of efficiently glycosylating various plant metabolites from different chemical classes in a stereo-and regioselective manner [23] . VvGT14a from grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is a promiscuous enzyme that can efficiently glucosylate not only terpenols such as geraniol, citronellol and nerol, but also eugenol [2] . Thus, plant glycosyltransferases are ideal biocatalysts for the biochemical and biotechnological production of small molecule glucosides but utilize costly cosubstrates such as UDP-glucose, which requires the use of whole-cell biocatalysts for cosubstrate recycling and efficient production [7] .In the development of an in vivo biocatalytic glycosylation process, a number of issues have to be considered including the availability of suitable UGTs, amount of the catalytically active protein, the import of substrate, the export of product and the toxicity of the starting material [8] . Multiple glycosides can already be produced by biocatalysis as numerous UGTs have been functionally characterized and protein engineering studies have identified crucial amino acids that are important for acceptor and sugar donor preferences and regioselectivity [14] . However, apart from producing oligosaccharides that reached titres up to 188 g/l, the product yields are unsatisfactory and improvements are urgently needed [7] .The productivity of a whole-cell bioprocess is highly dependent on the effective production of functional enzymes encoded on expression plasmids or microbial chromosomes. The potential strain activity is the product of the enzyme concentration and its correctly formed proportion. Enzyme level and productivity could be increased by influencing the expression of the gene of interest, by using an efficient origin of replication (ori) [24] , and by choosing appropriate selection markers (e.g. antibiotic resistance gene). Product titre was also raised by utilizing additional beneficial genes (e.g. the lac-repressor lacI) [34] , by optimizing the ribosomal binding site [37] , or by fusing the enzyme to a solubility enhancing partner [33] . In addition, catalytic efficiency of biocatalysts was increased by random mutagenesis followed by a screening for better performing variants [9] and the lifetime of enzymes was extended by modifying the C-terminus [27] . Furthermore, additional expression of chaperones promoted proper folding and prevented the accumulation of inactive enzyme in inclusion bodies [36] .Therefore, optimization of the vector for improved process productivity involves the selection of a suitable resistance marker, ori, promoter, and fusion tag. Ampicillin was not suitable for high cell-density fermentation as it was rapidly degraded in the periplasm [1] . Kanamycin was more stable and better suited for high cell-density fermentations [31, 32] . The ori determines the plasmid copy number (PCN). Plasmids with the pBR322 ori resulted in a PCN of approximately 15-20 [3] , whereas the high-copy ori RSF yielded PCN of over 100 copies [6] . The promoter affects the expression strength and tac and T7 are considered strong, inducible promoters [4, 35] . A gene containing a T7 promoter is only transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase encoded by the lambda DE3 prophage insertion. Therefore, only strains with the (DE3) insertion transcribe genes harbouring a T7 promoter [15] . The small fusion tags, His-tag and S-tag, are mainly used for protein purification purposes [40] while larger fusion tags are said to improve solubility. The SUMO-and the trxA-tags are 100 and 109 amino acids long, respectively, and the glutathione S-transferase (GST)tag has a length of 211 amino acids [26] . Other fusion tags like NusA and MBP are also often used to facilitate higher solubility, however they are even bigger than GST with 495 and 396 amino acids, respectively [7] . NusA and MBP were not investigated in this study due to their enormous sizes. The aim of an optimal fusion protein is to facilitate higher solubility without impeding the strain's metabolism.To increase the glucoside titres in a biotransformation process using E. coli whole-cell biocatalysts expressing the codon-optimized glucosyltransferase VvGT14ao, seven plasmids were generated, which differed in the antibiotic resistance gene, ori, promoter, and fusion tag (Supplemental Table S3 ) and were used to transformed in four common different host strains. Since there is a large number of expression vectors and E. coli expression hosts, only a few frequently used expression vectors could be investigated in this study. Parallel biotransformations were performed in a 24-well format and levels of geranyl, neryl, citronellyl, and eugenyl glucoside quantified by liquid chromatography (LC). The construction of an optimized expression system increased the productivity of the bioprocess considerably.  Chemicals, enzymes, and expression vectors  Thiamine, iron(III) chloride, nerol and citronellol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany), boric acid from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and manganese(II) chloride from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium). All other chemicals were obtained from Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). The T4 DNA Ligase was purchased from Promega (Mannheim, Germany) and all other enzymes from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Planegg, Germany). Expression vectors pET-29a(+) (pET29a), pET-32a(+) (pET32a) and pRSF-Duet-1 were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), pGEX-4T-1 from GE Healthcare Life Sciences (Solingen, Germany) and pET His6 Sumo TEV LIC cloning vector (1S) (pET-SUMO) was a gift from Scott Gradia (Addgene plasmid # 29659; http://n2t.net/addge ne:29659 ; RRID:Addgene_ 29659).  Nucleic acid extraction  Plasmid DNA was extracted from E. coli by using the PureYield™ Plasmid Miniprep System (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instruction. DNA fragments from PCR reactions and agarose gels were purified by using the NucleoSpin ® Gel and PCR Cleanup kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol.  Construction of plasmids  The cloning strategies and vector maps are shown in Supplemental Figures S1 to S8. The glucosyltransferase gene VvGT14a was isolated from Vitis vinifera and the encoded protein biochemically characterized [2] . VvGT14ao was cloned in frame with the N-terminal GST tag into the pGEX-4T-1 expression vector (Amersham Bioscience), which was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany) synthesized the codon-optimized gene VvGT14ao. The expression vector pET-SUMO_VvGT14ao was produced by ligation independent cloning (LIC) [12] . The entry vector was linearized by using SspI and subsequently treated with T4 DNA polymerase and dGTP. The gene of interest was amplified by PCR using primers with the LIC-site extension (Supplemental Table S1 ). The purified PCR product was treated with T4 DNA polymerase and dCTP. The annealing was performed with a vector-to-insert ratio of 1:3 regarding to the amount of substance. All other constructs were produced by standard cloning procedures. For the cloning of the VvGT14ao gene, the entry vectors were digested with BamHI and NotI and dephosphorylated with FastAP. The gene of interest was amplified by PCR using primers with the corresponding BamHI-/NotI-extensions (Supplemental Table S1 ). Where applicable, the primers were additionally expanded with spacer bases to assure an in-frame insertion. The cleavage was also done with BamHI and NotI. The constructs were finished with a ligation. The vectors pGEX-K and pET32aK are modified versions of pGEX-4T-1 and pET32a. Their ampicillin cassettes were exchanged with the kanamycin resistance cassette KanR2 from pRSFDuet-1. For the cloning of pET32aK two parts, pET32a backbone and the kanamycin resistance gene, were amplified by PCR using primers with an Eco31I + linker-extension (Supplemental Table S1 ). Both parts were cleaved with the IIS nuclease Eco31I, creating two unique overhangs. The construct was finished with a ligation. For the cloning of pGEX-K, the entry vector pGEX-4T-1 was digested with AatII and BsaI and dephosphorylated by using FastAP. Subsequently, the DNA fragment was gel purified. The kanamycin resistance gene was amplified by PCR using primers with the corresponding AatII/BsaI-extensions (Supplemental Table S1 ). The cleavage of both parts was performed with AatII and BsaI. The construct was finished after ligation. All ligations were performed by T4 DNA ligase (Promega) with a vectorto-insert ratio of 1:3 by weight. The codon-optimized UGT gene VvGT14ao was cloned by a standard restriction-ligation procedure into respective plasmids to obtain pET29a_VvG-T14ao, pET32a_VvGT14ao, pET32aK_VvGT14ao, pGEX-4T-1_VvGT14ao, pGEX-K_VvGT14ao and pRSFDuet-1_ VvGT14ao (Supplemental Figure S1 ). The restriction of the PCR product (insert) and the target vectors was also done with BamHI and NotI. The constructs were finished with a ligation.  Sequencing  The DNA sequences of new constructs were analysed by Eurofins Genomics GmbH and confirmed with DNA sequence alignment using Serial Cloner (http://seria lbasi cs.free.fr/ Serial_Cloner.html; version 2.6.1).  Transformation  The different vectors were combined with suitable hosts according to their promotors. Vectors containing the T7 promoter were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Vectors with the tac promoter were additionally combined with E. coli BL21 and E. coli Waksman. The resulting 18 production strains were tested under the 1 3 same conditions with the following four substrates: geraniol, nerol, citronellol and eugenol.  Minimal medium  The M9 minimal medium was prepared after the recipe from Arie Geerlof (https ://www.helmh oltz-muenc hen.de/ filea dmin/PEPF/Proto cols/M9-mediu m_15051 0.pdf). One litre of medium was produced by adding 100 mL of M9 salt solution 10x (Na 2 HPO 4 × 2 H 2 O 75.2 g/L, KH 2 PO 4 30 g/L, NaCl 5 g/L, and NH 4   In vivo glycosylation using HitPlate cultivation  The method was adapted from a shaking flask method and optimized in terms of culture medium, and method of inoculation and induction [13] . For each test culture one well of the HitPlate 25 (24 well microtitre plate; HJ-BIOANALY-TIK GmbH, Germany; Fig. 1 ) was filled with 2 mL fresh M9 medium and the appropriate concentration of antibiotic. The wells were inoculated with fresh cells either from an agar plate or from a liquid culture. This pre-culture plate was incubated overnight at 37 °C and 250 rpm on an orbital shaker with a shaking stroke of 25 mm. For the main culture, each well was filled with 2 mL M9 medium and the needed antibiotics. The wells were inoculated with 50 µL of preculture (2.5%) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C and 250 rpm on an orbital shaker with a shaking stroke of 25 mm. After Fig. 1 Production of glucosides by whole-cell biocatalysts using HitPlates as a cultivation system (a) and demonstration of the reproducibility (b). The production process includes the preparation of the pre-culture from fresh material (1), main culture (2), protein expression (3), biotransformation (4), sampling (5), HPLC analysis (6), and calculation of the product titre (7) . Different strains were tested with this cultivation system to test its reproducibility. The cultivation was repeated four times in duplicate using geraniol as substrate. Geranyl glucoside was quantified by LC. Strains 1-5: E. coli BL21/ pGEX-K_VvGT14ao, E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS/pET29a_ VvGT14ao, E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS/pET32aK_VvGT14ao, E. coli BL21/pGEX-4T-1_VvG-T14ao, and E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS/pET32a_VvGT14ao. The average geranyl glucoside yields are shown with the 95% confidence intervals incubation the cultures were induced by adding 25 µL of 0.1 M isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) solution to each well resulting in an IPTG concentration of 1.25 mM. Subsequently, the cultures were incubated for protein production for 20 h at 18 °C and 500 rpm on an orbital shaker with a shaking stroke of 10 mm. After protein production, the cultures were supplemented with 500 µL of fresh M9 medium containing the required antibiotics and the substrate 0.1% (v/v) for the biotransformation. After substrate addition, the cultivation was continued for an additional 24 h under the same conditions. Finally, the optical density at 600 nm was measured from each well to determine the final cell concentration. From each well, a 1-mL sample was transferred to a micro-reaction tube and centrifuged. The supernatant was transferred to an HPLC vial for product analysis.  LC analysis  All LC machine parts were from Jasco   Validation of the experimental set-up  A small-scale production system based on microtitre plates (HitPlates) was utilized to reliably quantify the titres obtained with the production strains generated in this study (Fig. 1) . The plates allowed the downscaling from shaking flasks with 50 mL of culture to a working volume of 2 mL culture per well. Each well had a total volume of 25 mL, which allowed for high rotational speeds (Supplemental Table S2 ). The formation of a wave inside the wells could only be observed at rotational speeds upwards of 200 rpm. The maximum wave height was 6, 13, and 16 mm above the resting liquid level at rotational speeds of 300, 400, and 500 rpm, respectively. The formation of a wave increases the liquids surface and improves the surface/volume ratio further. This was necessary for good aeration and thus for unhindered cell growth. Experiments could be performed in parallel and in multiple determination across the 24 wells (4 × 6) of the plate. Multiple repetitions of biotransformation experiments confirmed the reproducibility of the experimental results (Fig. 1) . Initially, the cell densities were adjusted before induction. Since the cell densities were only slightly different, but the workload involved was high, the laborious adaptation was omitted. Since the glucosyltransferase VvG-T14ao (codon-optimized) from grapevine, which was used to develop the whole-cell biocatalysts exhibited promiscuous activity toward terpenols and phenols [2] , four alcohols (geraniol, nerol, citronellol, and eugenol) were used as substrates. In total, 18 strains were generated and analysed (Figs. 2 and 3) . The experiments were carried out three times and each culture measured in duplicate.  pET29a_VvGT14ao  Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS/pET29a_VvGT14ao (Fig. 3, strain #4 ) was the initial strain for the biotransformation and was used as a reference. The widely used expression vector pET29a provided a S-tag sequence upstream of the multiple cloning site (MCS) and thus, the resulting protein was fused to an N-terminal S-tag. The titres achieved with strain #4 ranged from 0.007 to 0.017 mM for eugenyl glucoside and citronellyl glucoside, respectively. Since no clear substrate preference was observed, the average titre of all substrates was determined (Fig. 3b) . When pET29a_ VvGT14ao was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Fig. 3 , strain #3), the product concentration increased significantly ranging from 0.058 to 0.097 mM for geranyl glucoside and eugenyl glucoside, respectively. The pLysS plasmid, which produces T7 lysozyme to reduce basal level expression of the gene of interest, appeared to be interfering with the production of glucosides.  pRSFDuet-1_VvGT14ao  The pRSFDuet-1 vector can be used for co-expression of two genes and was used in this study as alternative expression plasmid offering the possibility to co-express supportive enzymes. Both strains, E. coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, combined with pRSFDuet-1_VvG-T14ao produced only a small amount of glucosides of less than 0.009 mM (Fig. 3, strains #1 and #2 ). There was no significant difference between the two strains in terms of product titre. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS/pRSFDuet-1_VvG-T14ao (Fig. 3, strain #2 ) only grew to an optical density (OD) of 0.13 on average, while strain #1 showed an OD of 2.4 (Supplemental Figure S9 ). Taking the cell concentration into account, strain #2 is over 10-fold more productive than strain #1. However, strain #2 is not suitable for glucoside production due to the extremely low cell growth. Overall, pRSFDuet-1 offered no advantage in terms of productivity over the pET29a vector.  pET32aK_VvGT14ao  The pET32aK vector harboured the trxA sequence coding for the thioredoxin protein upstream of the MCS resulting in a fusion protein with the thioredoxin protein on the N-terminus. This fusion partner should promote solubility and lead to a correctly folded, active enzyme. Both strains, E. coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, combined with pET32aK_VvGT14ao (Fig. 3 , strains #5 and #6, respectively) produced on average 0.057 mM and 0.052 mM terpenyl glucosides. The glucoside titres between strain #5 and #6 did not differ significantly, but were considerably increased in comparison with the reference strain #4. Thus, the fusion protein thioredoxin has a positive effect on the productivity of the whole-cell biocatalyst.  pET-SUMO_VvGT14ao  The pET-SUMO vector carried the nucleotide sequence coding for the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) upstream of the LIC site and thus, the resulting protein contained an N-terminal SUMO-tag. The vector was chosen because the fusion product was reported to be more soluble and to increase the activity of the biocatalyst. E. coli BL21(DE3), and E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS combined with pET-SUMO_VvGT14ao (Fig. 3 , strains #7 and #8, respectively) produced high concentrations of glucosides but differed significantly in their glucosylation capabilities. The product levels ranged from 0.048 to 0.081 mM of eugenyl and citronellyl glucoside for strain #8, respectively, and from 0.072 to 0.120 mM of geranyl and eugenyl glucoside for strain #7, respectively. The SUMO fusion tag resulted in significantly increased product titres. The productivity of the bioprocess was improved by a factor   pGEX-K_VvGT14ao  The vector pGEX-K harboured the gene coding for GST upstream of the MCS. GST is a relatively large fusion protein and enhances the solubility of its fusion partner. Four different E. coli strains were transformed with the pGEX-K_VvGT14ao vector resulting in strains #9-#12 (Fig. 3) . E. coli BL21 does not carry the gene for T7 RNA polymerase and thus is only suitable for expression from promoters recognized by the E. coli RNA polymerase. The E. coli Waksman strain is a very fast growing strain, produces low amounts of acetate and can be grown to high cell density during fed-batch culture with relative ease, and has good tolerance for environmental stresses. E. coli Waksman, E. coli BL21(DE3), and E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS combined with pGEX-K_VvGT14ao (Fig. 3, strains #9 , #11, and #12, respectively) only showed low product levels. Strain #9 was the weakest producer, followed by strain #11, and then strain #12. Levels never exceeded 0.033 mM (citronellyl glucoside, strain #12). In contrast, E. coli BL21/pGEX-K_VvGT14ao (Fig. 3, strain #10 ) produced significant product titres ranging from 0.057 to 0.084 mM of eugenyl glucosides and citronellyl glucoside, respectively. The fusion protein pGEX-K_VvGT14ao produced high levels of glucosides, but only in the genetic background of E. coli BL21.  pET32a_VvGT14ao  Next, the effect of the antibiotic resistance gene on productivity of the whole-cell biocatalyst was determined. biotransformations were performed in the presence of ampicillin instead of kanamycin (Fig. 3) . E. coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS combined with pET32a_VvG-T14ao (Fig. 3 , strains #13 and #14, respectively), the vector expressing a VvGT14ao fusion protein with the thioredoxin protein on the N-terminus, exhibited significantly different glucosylation activities. Strains #13 and #14 produced 0.010 and 0.079 mM eugenyl glucoside, respectively. In this case, the pLysS plasmid, which produced T7 lysozyme appeared to enhance the production of glucosides.  E. coli cells were transformed with suitable vectors and  A comparison of the titres produced by trxA_VvGT14ao fusion proteins in E. coli cells exhibiting kanamycin (strains #5 and #6) and ampicillin resistance (strains #13 and #14) showed similar glucoside levels, except for pET32a_VvG-T14ao (strain #13), which generated only minor amounts of the products.  pGEX-4T-1_VvGT14ao  Finally, the productivity of whole-cell biocatalysts expressing GST fusion proteins in ampicillin-resistant E. coli strains was determined. E. coli Waksman and E. coli BL21(DE3) combined with pGEX-4T-1_VvGT14ao (Fig. 3 , strains #15 and #17, respectively) produced only small amounts of glucosides (e.g. less than 0.027 mM of neryl glucoside, strain #15). In contrast, E. coli BL21 and E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS expressing pGEX-4T-1_VvGT14ao (Fig. 3 , strains #16 and #18, respectively) produced substantial amounts of products, in case of citronellyl glucoside up to 0.068 mM (strain #18). Similarly, GST_VvGT14ao fusion proteins yielded the highest titres in the kanamycin-resistant E. coli BL21 (strain #10) and BL21(DE3)pLysS (strain #12) genetic background.  Effect of pLysS and antibiotic resistance  To find the most suitable whole-cell biocatalyst for the biotechnological production of small molecule glucosides various combinations of hosts and expression vectors were tested that differed in resistance gene, origin of replication, promoter sequence, and fusion protein tag. Focusing on the kanamycin-resistant strains, a trend was observed. The majority of E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strains (strains #2, #4, #6, and #8) produced lower glucoside titres than their E. coli BL21(DE3) counterparts (strains #1, #3, #5, and #7). In both hosts, the expression of VvGT14ao prior to IPTG induction was inhibited by the lac-repressor lacI, which was constitutively expressed. In E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS the plasmid pLysS constitutively expressed T7 lysozyme, which suppressed the basal expression of the target protein even further by inhibiting the T7 RNA polymerase. The tendency of E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strains to produce fewer glucosides was therefore explicable, as the residual basal expression of VvGT14ao should not be a heavy burden on the cell.The low expression of LacI had a rather small impact on the metabolism of the cell unlike the propagation of an extra plasmid such as pLysS. The extra tight expression provided by pLysS is only needed for the production of toxic proteins.Looking at the ampicillin-resistant strains, the above trend seemed to be reverse. Here, the E. coli BL21(DE3) strains formed less product than their counterparts with pLysS. This effect could also be seen with the strains combined with pGEX-4T-1_VvGT14ao ( Fig. 3 ; strains #17 and #18) and pGEX-K_VvGT14ao (strains #11 and #12) and was also observed during the production of the chicken anaemia virus capsid protein VP1 (VP1). The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS yielded 6-times as much VP1 compared with E. coli BL21(DE3) using the same vector [20] . The pGEX-4T-1 and pGEX-K vectors did not carry the T7 promoter (Fig. 2) and neither the T7 RNA polymerase nor the T7 lysozyme could affect the transcription of VvGT14ao. Therefore, there might be a more complex interaction between pLysS and the heterologous protein production.  Effect of fusion tags  The fusion of VvGT14ao with a solubility-enhancing peptide tag appeared to have a positive effect on product titre, compared to the His-tag (strain #1 and #2). Maximum product yields were achieved with E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-SUMO_VvGT14ao (strain #7), a host expressing VvGT14ao fused to the gene coding for SUMO. The addition of SUMO has already been proven to increase the yield of a target protein in E. coli such as the SARS-CoV 3CL protease [41] and of the rotavirus VP6 inner capsid protein (VP6) [5] . Similarly, the SUMO fusion tag could improve the solubility, yield and antigen-binding activity of the variable domains of the heavy chain of the heavy-chain antibodies [25] . E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-SUMO_VvGT14ao (strain #7) produced 8 times more glucosides than the same host expressing the GST_VvGT14ao fusion (strain #11). However, the fusion tag sequence was not the only difference between the two expression vectors used. They also carried different promoters and had a widely different vector backbone. Therefore, the product increase was probably not due solely to the different fusion tag.  Effect of promoter  The pGEX vectors in E. coli BL21 (strains #10 and #16) produced considerably more glucosides than the same vectors in E. coli BL21(DE3) (strains #11 and #17). For example E. coli BL21/pGEX-K_VvGT14ao (strain #10) produced 5 times the amount of glucosides compared to E. coli BL21(DE3)/pGEX-K_VvGT14ao (strain #11). E. coli BL21 does not contain the (DE3) insertion and does not express the T7 RNA polymerase when induced, which poses less metabolic burden on the cell metabolism. Since all other vectors contained the T7 promoter, which required the (DE3) insertion, this hypothesis could not be confirmed with additional data.  Cell growth  All strains grew to an optical density above 2.0 except for four strains: E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS/pRSFDuet-1_VvG-T14ao (Supplemental Figure S9; Fig. 3 , strain #2), E. coli Waksman/pGEX-K_VvGT14ao (Fig. 3, strain #9 ), E. coli BL21(DE3)/pGEX-K_VvGT14ao (Fig. 3, strain #11) , and E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS/pGEX-K_VvGT14ao (Fig. 3, strain  #12 ). The three strains containing pGEX-K_VvGT14ao (Fig. 3, strains #9 , #11, and #12) grew to a density of 50 -70% of that of E. coli BL21 with pGEX-K_VvGT14ao (Fig. 3, strain #10) . Even if the cell concentration is taken into account, E. coli BL21/pGEX-K_VvGT14ao (Fig. 3 , strain #10) still exceeded the productivity of strains #9, #11, and #12. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS with pRSFDuet-1_VvG-T14ao (Fig. 3 , strain #2) only grew to an optical density of barely above 5% of the most productive strain #7 (E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-SUMO_VvGT14ao). Taking the cell concentration into account, E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS/pRSF-Duet-1_VvGT14ao (Fig. 3 , strain #2) would be slightly more productive than E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-SUMO_VvGT14ao (Fig. 3, strain #7) . However, the extremely low cell growth of strain #2 makes this strain unsuitable for the production of glucosides. The pRSFDuet-1 vector uses the RSF ori and is the only high-copy vector tested here. The pRSFDuet-1 vector does not seem suitable for large-scale glucoside production since both strains did not perform well. It has already been shown, that high-copy vectors are not suitable for protein expression unless the basal expression is suppressed adequately [11] .  Suitable combinations  Since the conversions of various substrates did not show a clear trend toward a preferred acceptor molecule, the product titres of the four glucoside products were pooled (Fig. 3b) , allowing a clearer distinction between the different strains. The different strains could be categorized into three groups according to their measured product yields. The categories are low performing (0-0.04 mM), average performing (0.04-0.08 mM), and high performing strains (0.08 mM and above).  Conclusions  Escherichia coli BL21 was a superior host for glucoside production using pGEX-K_VvGT14ao as an expression vector (strain #10) while E. coli BL21(DE3) was the preferred host for the production of glucosides using the remaining four expression plasmids containing a kanamycin resistance gene (pRSFDuet-1_VvGT14ao, pET29a_VvGT14ao, pET32aK_ VvGT14ao, and pET-SUMO_VvGT14ao). The highest product titres were generated from E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS when vectors carrying an ampicillin resistance (pET32a_ VvGT14ao, and pGEX-4T-1_VvGT14ao) were used. The E. coli Waksman strain only produced small amounts of glucosides under the applied testing conditions. In summary, it is anticipated that the expression of a SUMO-VvGT14ao fusion protein in E. coli BL21 would result a highly efficient whole-cell biocatalyst for the production of terpenyl and phenyl β-d-glucopyranosides. The results of the HP cultivation can be employed to select promising production strains for scale-up experiments in shaking flasks. The system can also be adapted to test other production strains for various whole-cell biotransformation applications.  					1			
9360	In vitro differentiation and pH sensitivity of field and cell culture-attentuated strains of transmissible gastroenteritis virus.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC420814/	Characteristics of four transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus field strains (Miller, Purdue, Bl, and V203) and four cell culture-attenuated strains (Purdue, SH, CKp, and Bl) were studied to find methods of differentiation between the two groups of viruses. TGE field virus strains did not replicate as well as attenuated strains at 37 C and could not be passaged serially for more than four to six passages at 33 C. There were clear differences in plaque size when the strains were compared. Field strains had average plaque sizes ranging from 3.59 to 3.15 mm, whereas attenuated strains induced plaques that were larger than 4.2 mm. Variations were observed in stability of strains at pH 3.0. Field strains and cell culture-attenuated strains CKp-270 and SH-114 were reduced in titer by about 1 log10. A reduction of about 3 log10, however, was obtained with cell culture strains B1-300 and Purdue-113.						1			
26641031	Assessment of the economic impacts of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in the United States	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109690/	Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which first emerged in the United States in 2013, spread throughout the U.S. hog population. Limited preemptive knowledge impeded the understanding of PEDV introduction, spread, and prospective economic impacts in the United States. To assess these impacts, this article reviews the timeline of PEDV in the United States and the corresponding impacts. PEDV is a supply-impacting disease and is not demand inhibiting, as pork demand remained strong since PEDV first appeared. Pig losses reached significant levels during September 2013 through August 2014, with the majority of pork production impacts occurring in 2014. PEDV had differing impacts for subsectors of the pork industry. A budget model demonstrates that producers could have had pig losses and decreases in productivity proportionally smaller than price increases, resulting in net returns above what was expected before the major outbreak of PEDV. Previous literature is reviewed to identify the potential main industry beneficiaries of the PEDV outbreaks in the United States. As a result of reduced volumes of available pig and hog supplies, reductions in annual returns likely occurred for packers, processors, distributors, and retailers. In addition, pork consumers who experienced reduced-supply-induced pork-price increases were likely harmed directly by higher prices paid for pork and indirectly as prices of competing meats were also likely strengthened by PEDV. This article also identifies future considerations motivated by the appearance of PEDV in the United States, such as discussions of industry-wide efficiency and competitive advantage, the future role of PEDV vaccines, enhancement in biosecurity measures, and consumer perceptions of food safety and insecurity.	INTRODUCTION  The first U.S. cases of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) appeared in April 2013 (USDA APHIS, 2014) . By May 2014, it had been identified in 29 of the contiguous states (Hennessy, 2014) . PEDV is an enveloped, RNA coronavirus (Pan et al., 2012; Song and Park, 2012; Huang et al., 2013) that causes morbidity in pigs of all ages but is most fatal to preweaned pigs. Transmission of PEDV is mainly through the fecal-oral route, but many different modes of transmission are possible through either direct or indirect contact (Sun et al., 2012; Geiger and Connor, 2013) .While PEDV is not a new swine disease globally, the April 2013 occurrence represented the first time the disease was identified within the United States, and prospective impacts of the disease were unclear.The goal of this article is to consider, within the limitations of current knowledge, the economic impacts of PEDV in the United States. There is still much that is not known about PEDV. This holds at least as much for economic impacts as for other aspects of PEDV. Hence, the assessment to be presented here is more demonstrative than definitive. The U.S. hog market was certainly impacted by changes in input prices reflecting weather shocks, trade policy, meat demand, and macroeconomic factors that are not attributable to PEDV. Still, using economic theory and intuition and available data, the article assesses the economic impacts in broad terms, providing a conceptual framework of the economic influence of PEDV.  TIMELINE OF PEDV AND CORRESPONDING SUPPLY AND DEMAND IMPACTS  Livestock diseases can have differing impacts depending on typology and severity. Diseases impacting the food supply can have extremely large impacts on the entire livestock industry as outbreaks of some diseases can lead to dramatic supply reductions, partial or full stoppages of varying duration with trading partners, as well as a hesitation to consume meat products from regions that are found to have livestock disease outbreaks. A less severe scenario includes a spread of disease throughout the herd, causing diminished productivity or an increase in mortality and morbidity rates or both.  PEDV Is a Supply Impacting Disease  The primary, and often only, clinical signs of PEDV are acute watery diarrhea and vomiting (Geiger and Connor, 2013) . PEDV is most serious in neonatal piglets where morbidity and mortality can be 80% to 100%, with mortality increasing as age increases (USDA, 2013) . The severity of PEDV can vary widely and is dependent on previous exposure and the immunological and epidemiologic status of the farm, region, or area affected (Geiger and Connor, 2013) .Any estimate of the supply impact of PEDV is inherently uncertain given the wide range in severity and length of the disease after an outbreak, any potential confounding effects (e.g., hog weights, inventory expansion or contraction, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome, etc.), and the imprecise reporting of PEDV cases. That said, available data can be used to formulate an estimate of the impact of PEDV on pork supply.The Swine Health Monitoring Project provides a standardized way of tracking PEDV . The project tracks about 2.1 million sows (out of a national total of approximately 5.8 million). The benefit of this project is that only new outbreaks of PEDV are reported. Furthermore, the project provides a PEDV epidemic threshold given the seasonality in the outbreak of coronaviruses. This project showed an increase in the number of PEDV cases in June 2013 and an even more dramatic increase that started in September 2013 (Fig. 1 ). The number of new cases of PEDV as tracked in the Swine Monitoring Project was then above epidemic threshold levels through June 2014. For illustrative purposes, the "year of PEDV" for inventory impacts was deemed September 2013 through August 2014, which allows comparisons across USDA Hogs and Pigs reports. Over 50% of sow farms tracked in the Swine Health Monitoring Project had new outbreaks during the "year of PEDV" (UM SDEC, 2014) .Year-over-year comparisons are a popular way to evaluate changes in swine inventories and pork production (Table 1) . Annual inventory changes in the "year of PEDV" were estimated from USDA Hogs and Pigs reports. This report, issued four times yearly, presents data on the U.S. pig crop for 16 major states and the United States, including inventory number by class, weight group, farrowings, and farrowing intentions (USDA NASS, 2015a). The number of sows farrowing in the United States was slightly smaller (28,000 sows) in September 2013 through August 2014 compared to September 2012 through August 2013. However, the combined year-over-year reduction in the number of sows farrowing (−0.25%) pales in comparison to the reduction (−3.03%) in pigs saved per litter. Given that PEDV is a disease marked by death loss among young pigs through weaning age, the 0.31 decrease in the number of pigs saved per litter was the primary contributor to the reduced pig crop. The U.S. pig crop was estimated to be 112,476,000 based on a summation of the quarterly pig crop estimates from September 2013 through August 2014. This estimate of the U.S. pig crop was 3,725,000 head or 3.21% smaller than compared to the September 2012 through August 2013 period.U.S. exports and imports of live hogs are relatively small compared to U.S. production and slaughter, such that no inventory disposition for live hog trade is included in the analysis. To put these numbers in perspective, the annual U.S. pig crop in September 2012 through August 2013 was 116,201,000 hogs. U.S. exports of live hogs to all destinations totaled 42,049 hogs, and live hog imports from all destinations totaled 5,296,826 hogs (USDA ERS, 2015a).Annual inventory changes in the "year of PEDV" roughly corresponded to pork production impacts in the 2014 calendar year. In 2014, total commercial hog slaughter in the U.S. was estimated at 106,875,700 hogs, a decrease of 5,201,000 hogs or 4.64% below 2013 levels.In 2014, producers likely found it profitable to feed hogs to heavier weights resulting in a short-term dramatic increase in carcass weights of 3.31%. There are a number of factors that could have influenced this including utilizing excess physical capacity caused by pig losses, capitalizing on an extremely favorable hog price to feed price ratio, and packers accepting (without discount) heavier hogs. Marsh (1999) suggests short-run changes in market prices impact carcass weights, and hence commercial production. This is precisely the case in regard to U.S. pork production in 2014. The 3.31% increase in carcass weight offset some of the 4.64% reduction in commercial slaughter. In total, 2014 pork production decreased 1.48% below 2013 levels.The market shock induced by the PEDV outbreak also caused changes in livestock breeding decisions. As part of the USDA Hogs and Pigs report, producers are asked their farrowing levels for the previous quarter and farrowing intentions over the next 2 quarters. Farrowing intentions are a primary indicator of U.S. hog supplies (Diersen, 2004) . These intentions can be compared to actual farrowing levels from the previous quarter or year to identify general trends in supply. Sows farrowing during the "year of PEDV" (September 2013 through August 2014) were below the first and second intentions, except for the June-August 2014 quarter (Fig. 2) . The decline in sows farrowing despite strong incentives to expand may have been a result of PEDV's effect on gilt retention and an overall tight supply of market hogs. Generally, pigs are slaughtered about 6 mo or 2 quarters after being farrowed. Thus, fewer hogs were expected to be marketed in March-May 2014 and the following 2 quarters than had earlier been anticipated. The level of intentions and actual sows farrowing for the June-August quarter indicated producers were likely adjusting to price signals and production capabilities as PEDV was beginning to be mitigated in the national herd.Most economists consider the swine industry to operate like a textbook example of a commodity industry where long-run economic (not accounting) profits are zero. That is, in the long run, economists expect the swine industry to just cover its costs, making it neither advantageous for producers to expand production or exit the industry. The main implication of this is that 2014 profit levels were expected to lead swine producers to "bid away" margins in the form of buying or retaining replacement females or both to expand their herd, or making capital investments to increase herd capacity, etc. These adjustments, in time, are expected to return the breeding herd sector to more typical levels of profitability, increasing breeding inventories in the process.  Domestic Pork Demand  Pork produced from hogs that have had PEDV is safe for human consumption (UM CAHFS, 2013). News of PEDV has appeared extensively in the agriculture press but has received less attention by major national media, and there has been no noticeable effect on consumer demand for pork. It is critical to appreciate that PEDV having no impact on human health fails to guarantee no adverse pork demand impacts. That is, there are several other examples in the industry, such as the unfortunately labeled "swine flu" (2009 H1N1 situation), that have resulted in substantial, adverse economic impacts despite posing no "real" human health risk from pork consumption (Attavanich et al. 2011) . Demand is the relationship between the market price of a product and the quantity consumers are willing and able to buy. A measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demanded to changes in market price of a product is referred to as price elasticity of demand. In the short term, pork demand tends to be inelastic. For instance, Tonsor et al. (2010) estimate own-price pork elasticity to be −0.74 in the United States. This suggests short-term demand for pork is impacted, but not on a one-for-one basis when the price of pork changes. This is important to note as the pork industry has benefited from recent pork demand strength that warrants appreciation in assessing PEDV impacts.A quarterly and annual pork demand index maintained at Kansas State University indicates year-overyear gains in pork demand for every quarter during the Q4.2012 to Q4.2014 period. In 2014, pork demand increased 7.4%, which was the second-largest annual gain since 1990. Pork demand is measured in terms of inflation-adjusted value of per capita pork consumption. While per capita consumption fell by 0.83% in 2014, pork prices increased 10.29% over that time (Tonsor, 2015) . The price increase had been enough to more than offset the quantity reduction and allowed overall pork inflation-adjusted values to climb, which in turn increased hog prices and improved the overall economic situation of hog producers.  International Pork Trade  The current state of knowledge suggests that PEDV is not transmitted in pork (UM CAHFS, 2013). PEDV is not a disease that is listed as notifiable by the World Organization of Animal Health (OIE). Exports of U.S. pork and pork products were not expected to be subject to trade restrictions due to the outbreak of PEDV in the United States (Paarlberg, 2014) . International pork markets did however react to higher U.S. pork prices. The U.S. pork price is not the only factor that affects international trade; however, the price influence was strong and likely was a major determinant of trade flows. The discussion below focuses on quantity adjustments in trade flows. Trade values would reflect the high prices that resulted in trade flow adjustments.Pork exports from the United States decreased 133,855,000 pounds (2.68%) in 2014 compared to 2013 levels, but were 149,459,000 pounds (3.17%) higher than the 2008-2012 average (USDA ERS, 2015a). As with domestic demand, wholesale pork export demand is inelastic at −0.89 (Paarlberg et al., 2008) , such that trade volumes are impacted less than some may expect when domestic prices increase. Patterns of U.S. pork exports were likely further impacted by the situation of trading partners. In cases where other countries also experienced PEDV, some increased their import volumes such as Mexico (10.99% increase in 2014 compared to 2013; USDA ERS, 2015a).Pork imports into the United States increased 127,895,000 pounds or 14.54% in 2014 compared to 2013 levels and 181,443,000 pounds (21.97%) compared to the 2008-2012 average (USDA ERS, 2015a). Pork imports into the United States, which supply pork cuts to deficit U.S. markets, reacted strongly to the sharp decrease in U.S. hog slaughter. Imports from Canada, the largest source of U.S. pork imports, increased 9.48% in 2014 compared to 1 yr earlier (USDA ERS, 2015a).Despite these adjustments in trade flows, trade remains an important, growing, and supportive component of the U.S. hog and pork industry and adjustments are expected to moderate as supply and demand conditions equalize and pork prices rebalance. Moreover, the longer-term bullish forecasts for ongoing increases in U.S. pork exports reflect a fundamental desire of foreign consumers to purchase U.S. pork, which continues to support prices realized by U.S. swine producers (USDA ERS, 2015b).  WINNERS AND LOSERS OF PEDV  A critical step in assessing the economic impacts of PEDV is to identify the risks. To put these risks into context it is important to identify efficiency of the swine industry related to short-and long-term production. Three main aspects of efficiency in production are: (i) efficiency of the swine industry relative to food industries outside the livestock sector, (ii) efficiency of the swine industry relative to other livestock industries, and (iii) efficiency of one swine producer relative to others in the swine industry (Harris, 1970) . The primary manifestation of the first of these will be in the magnitude of money spent by the consuming public for pork relative to other food products. The second aspect of efficiency leads to the relative levels of consumption of beef, pork, poultry, etc.The efficiency of the swine industry may have short-term influences on the economic returns for the participants in that industry. For example, a single producer might be better off simply "riding out" an outbreak of PEDV, while others might insist rapid elimination measures are in the best interest of the industry as a whole. However, greater return on investment for all the participants in an industry will usually lead to either expansion within that industry or to new participants in the industry. So the long-term effects of industry-wide trends toward greater efficiency will not be greater profit for the participants in that industry but will be increased production, lower costs to the consumer, and greater consumption of the products. Hence, the main source of long-term profitability for a swine producer lies in their efficiency relative to other producers.  Producer Impacts  A budgeting approach was utilized to highlight the total cost of productivity (efficiency) losses for a representative farm. These returns were the market returns forecasted and ultimately realized in 2014 regardless of how the considered production levels were realized. That is, productivity levels can vary widely due to predetermined (e.g., facilities, genetics, geographic location of the operation, and some environmental factors), controllable (e.g., feed rations and biosecurity), and uncontrollable (e.g., weather and prevalence of specific diseases and pathogens) factors. A farrow-to-finish enterprise budget model that specified the mathematical relationships between production inputs and outputs, as well as the costs and revenues associated with production, was developed. The model captures the major relationships between productivity metrics, market pig prices, and input prices, making it possible to vary different market pig or feed prices, for example, to determine how they change the impact of PEDV on the profitability of the enterprise. To avoid the effect of operation-to-operation variation, constant standard reference values for capital expenditures and variable input prices not directly affected by PEDV were used in the budgeting model.Costs per unit and net returns in livestock production are highly dependent on production levels. Production level, in terms of pigs sold per mated female per year, for farrow-to-finish operations is assumed to vary due to differences in the number of pigs sold per litter and the number of litters per sow per year. Varying these two factors results in different numbers of pigs sold per sow per year. Given that PEDV is a disease marked by death loss among young pigs through weaning age, the primary productivity impact of PEDV is reflected in the number of pigs sold per litter. Table 2 includes forecasted net returns depicting the situation in September 2013 of a producer planning to sell market hogs in 2014 based on forecasts of both pigs sold per sow per year and forecasted market prices. Projected lean hog sales prices and feed prices result from Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures market prices for upcoming contracts, historical basis levels, and historical price/cost relationships. In this analysis, the 2014 average number of pigs sold per female per year was forecasted to be 20.48. Forecasting 2014 costs and returns in September 2013 suggested an average total revenue of $160.95 per finished hog, average total costs of $146.73 per finished hog, and returns over total costs of $14.22 per finished hog. The return on investment to farrow-to-finish production in 2014 was forecasted to be 9.66%.The first scenario to consider is what would have happened if the forecasted pigs sold per female per year (20.48) were realized in 2014. Using realized 2014 lean hog sales prices and feed prices our estimate of 2014 costs and returns were: average total revenue of $204.52 per finished hog, average total costs of $150.16 per finished hog, and returns over total costs of $54.36 per finished hog. The return on investment to farrow-to-finish production in 2014 was estimated to be 35.90%. While the September 2013 forecast of average total costs was $3.43 per finished hog lower than what was estimated to have occurred in 2014, average total revenue was $43.56 per finished hog higher.While this exercise demonstrates how returns on average exceeded expectations, it clearly masks over variation in economic impacts experienced by producers. Producers who realized no reduction in production clearly benefited by selling expected volumes at notably elevated price levels. Conversely, producers who were less fortunate and experienced reductions in throughput from PEDV would have realized lower net revenues and clearly been worse off.Our farrow-to-finish model suggests that with a 3% decrease in finished pigs sold per female in 2014, consistent with the reduction in pigs saved per litter during the "year of PEDV," returns over total costs would have been $1.49 lower per finished hog, but still $38.64 per finished hog higher than the September 2013 forecast. In fact, 2014 returns over total costs and return on investment would be roughly consistent with the September 2013 forecast with a 43% decrease in finished pigs sold per female in 2014.It is important to note that this demonstration assumes no differences across producers in costs such as investments in PEDV mitigation efforts. Inclusion of these cost differences would further expand the shown variation in impacts on individual producers.  Aggregate Impacts  While a complete economic assessment is beyond the scope of this paper, it is useful to summarize the main beneficiaries of the PEDV outbreaks in the United States. Given the reduced volumes of available pig and hog supplies, industry participants that rely on high-volume throughput (e.g., packers, processors, distributors, and retailers) are harmed. Paarlberg (2014) estimates pork packers experience reductions in annual returns of $481 million following a 3% reduction in pigs from PEDV and $929 million if supplies fall by 6%. Pork consumers who experience reduced-supply-induced pork-price increases are harmed directly (e.g., their pork costs more) but also indirectly as prices of competing meats (e.g., beef and poultry) are also strengthened by PEDV. Paarlberg (2014) suggests annual consumer surplus declines by $300 million to $600 million depending on the volume of supply reductions. The impact on producers is diverse and complicated as demonstrated throughout this article. This point is reinforced by Paarlberg (2014) , who notes losses to infected producers are smaller than gains to uninfected producers leading to the "surprising outcome" of a net gain for producers in aggregate.Ultimately, these gains for producers in aggregate are expected to incentivize expansion of the industry. In the absence of offsetting gains in externally driven pork demand, this expansion will proceed to erode producer profitability. This is just one of multiple longer-term impacts of PEDV that is still developing.   Other Considerations  Stakeholders throughout the pork industry have several goals that may have been impacted by PEDV. The industry collectively has a goal to produce a desired set of pork offerings at the least feasible cost to maintain industry-wide efficiency and sustain pork's competitive advantages compared to other meats. It could easily be argued that the uncertainty on production volume that followed PEDV outbreaks limited the industry's ability to meet this goal. Specifically, by introducing additional uncertainty on the volume of pigs, and hence pork, in the broader supply chain, segments of the industry operating in a risk-averse manner were less likely to make investments they otherwise would have made. Given this, it is possible the elevated hog prices observed reflect the market's recognition of a price premium being needed to offset uncertainty and encourage the process of expanding production.A second consideration worth monitoring in the future is the role of PEDV vaccines. Narrowly, the animal health and economic impacts triggered by recent PEDV experiences are bound to notably expand efforts to derive and improve vaccines and related "tools for the industry's toolbox" to use in future efforts to mitigate PEDV risks. Exactly how these new measures perform and fit into industry protocol is yet to be established but important to monitor.Perhaps a positive unintended consequence will be realized following observation of producers regarding the economic damage that operations with PEDV losses experienced. Narrowly, it is possible that the industry collectively will not only develop additional protocols and best practices for improving management of PEDV risks, but more broadly the entire industry may collectively implement more completely and stringently suggested biosecurity plans. If this is realized, it would certainly be an unexpected but valuable contribution.Finally, one issue that has not materialized in the case of PEDV but may in future animal health challenges is adverse response from pork consumers. Narrowly, the U.S. PEDV experience occurred without a drop in either domestic or export pork demand following concerns over perceptions (regardless of how inaccurate or misplaced) about reduced safety of corresponding pork products. This fortunate outcome should not be missed by industry stakeholders and may well be different in the future or in alternative animal disease cases.  Conclusion  Being prepared for diseases that are rare, exist only in other countries, or have yet to be identified is a challenging proposition. With major outbreaks of Foot-and-Mouth disease over the past couple of years around the world, Classical Swine Fever having occurred in nearly 20 countries, and ongoing concerns about African Swine Fever, PEDV was not the foreign animal disease at the height of U.S. fears, considerations, or planning. Nevertheless, the PEDV outbreak in the United States crystallized concerns that producers, allied industries, and consumers share about the economic impacts of animal disease and the complexity of predicting the size of such impacts.The pork industry did immediately respond to the PEDV outbreak in the United States through increased cooperation among pork producers, state and federal agencies, professional organizations, and other industry stakeholders. Each day more is learned about PEDV and its impact. With the benefit of more knowledge, the pork industry will be better equipped to address the virus, while preparing for other potential emerging disease scenarios.  	1							
17087733	Novel replication complex architecture in rubella replicon‐transfected cells	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162162/	Rubella virus (RUB) assembles its replication complexes (RCs) in modified organelles of endo‐lysosomal origin, known as cytopathic vacuoles (CPVs). These peculiar structures are key elements of RUB factories, where rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and Golgi are recruited. Bicistronic RUB replicons expressing an antibiotic resistance gene either in the presence or the absence of the RUB capsid (C) gene were used to study the structure of RCs in transfected cells. Confocal microscopy showed that the RUB replicase components P90 and P150 localized to CPVs, as did double‐stranded RNA (dsRNA), a marker for RNA synthesis. Electron microscopy (EM) showed that replicons generated CPVs containing small vesicles and large vacuoles, similar to CPVs from RUB‐infected cells and that the replicase proteins were sufficient for organelle recruitment. Some of these CPVs contained straight membranes. When cross‐sectioned, these rigid membranes appeared to be sheets of closely packed proteins. Immuno‐EM revealed that these sheets, apparently in contact with the cytosol, contained both P150 and P90, as well as dsRNA, and thus could be two‐dimensional arrays of functional viral replicases. Labelling of dsRNA after streptolysin‐O permeabilization showed that replication of viral genome takes place on the cytoplasmic side of CPVs. When present, C accumulated around CPVs. Mitochondrial protein P32 was detected within modified CPVs, the first demonstration of involvement of this protein, which interacts with C, with RCs.	Introduction  Enveloped RNA viruses replicate and assemble in association with cellular membranes, often in a complex structure, a 'viral factory', to which the participating cell and viral factors are recruited. Mitochondria, cytoskeletal elements and cellular endomembranes are frequent participants in the factory architecture. Knowledge about the signals involved in organelle recruitment and modification, as well as mechanisms operating in spatial connection between viral replication and morphogenesis, is very limited. One of the earliest events in the construction of the factory is the formation of the replication complexes (RCs). In this sense, the replication of viral genomes in association with intracellular membranes is a common feature of many viruses, particularly of positive-stranded RNA viruses (Salonen et al., 2005) . A variety of membranes are used by different viruses, including membranes of secretory pathway organelles (picorna-, arteri-, bromo-and flaviviruses) (Schlegel et al., 1996; van der Meer et al., 1998; Mackenzie et al., 1999; Suhy et al., 2000; Dubuisson et al., 2002; Westaway et al., 2002) , mitochondria (nodaviruses) (Miller et al., 2001) , peroxisomes and chloroplasts (tombusviruses) (Rochon, 1999) , endosomes and lysosomes (togaviruses) (Froshauer et al., 1988; Lee et al., 1994; Magliano et al., 1998; Kujala et al., 2001) and autophagosomes (arteriviruses, coronaviruses, poliovirus and rhinovirus) (reviewed by Wileman, 2006 ). It appears that targeting to the specific organelle is mediated by viral replicase components (Salonen et al., 2003; 2005) .A very unique feature of togaviruses is that their RCs assemble in modified organelles of endo-lysosomal origin that have been termed 'cytopathic vacuoles' or CPVs (Froshauer et al., 1988; Lee et al., 1994; Magliano et al., 1998) . CPVs contain internalized, membrane-bound spherules of 50-70 nm which are thought to be the sites of viral RNA synthesis. In some electron micrographs, these spherules appear to be connected with the organelle membrane by slender threads or 'necks'. It is probably through these necks that newly synthesized RNA is transported to the cytoplasm. While the two togavirus genera, alphaviruses (e.g. Semliki Forest virus and Sindbis virus) and rubiviruses (rubella virus, RUB), generate CPVs with a similar morphology and have rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) cisternae and mitochondria around, Golgi stacks are additionally recruited to RUB CPVs (Lee et al., 1992; Magliano et al., 1998; Risco et al., 2003) forming a 'viral factory' where the virus replicates, assembles and matures (Lee and Bowden, 2000; Novoa et al., 2005a) .The study of intracellular RUB infection has been hampered by the slow rate of virus replication and lack of synchronous infection in culture cells. The RUB genome is a single-stranded RNA of plus-polarity of~10 kb in length that contain two open reading frames (ORF), a 5′ proximal ORF (the NS-ORF) that encodes the two nonstructural replicase components, P150 and P90, and is translated from the genome RNA and a 3′ proximal ORF (the SP-ORF) that encodes the virion structural proteins, capsid (C) and envelope glycoproteins E2 and E1 and is translated from a subgenomic RNA synthesized in infected cells (Frey, 1994) . Replicons which substitute reporter genes for the SP-ORF have been developed and used to study replication in the absence of the virion proteins (Tzeng et al., 2001) . Recently, genomic and replicon constructs have been generated which express an additional gene under control of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (Pugachev et al., 2000) . When the additional gene is an antibiotic resistance gene, populations of stably transfected cells that uniformly harbour the replicon can be selected (Chen and Icenogle, 2004) enhancing the ability to study intracellular replication events.In this study we have initiated the structural examination of RCs and CPVs in stable replicon-transfected cells by confocal and electron microscopy (EM). Although it is not required for RNA synthesis, the virus C protein has recently been shown to both enhance and modulate virus RNA synthesis (Tzeng and Frey, 2005; Tzeng et al., 2006) and rescue a variety of deleterious viral mutants, an effect manifested at the level of RNA synthesis (Tzeng and Frey, 2003; Chen and Icenogle, 2004; Tzeng et al., 2006) . Furthermore, the C protein binds to a mitochondrial protein, P32, and has been reported to alter the cellular distribution of mitochondria (Beatch et al., 2005) . Therefore, it was of interest to study the effect of expression of the C protein on RCs in replicon-transfected cells. For EM, specimens were prepared by freeze substitution, allowing for superior structural preservation, prior to embedding and sectioning. This is the first study of togaviruses RCs and CPVs in which freeze substitution has been employed for sample preparation and differences in CPV morphology were noted, included discovery of a novel CPV architecture in replicon-transfected cells that is also present in CPVs assembled in virus infected cells.  Formation of RCs in RUB replicon-transfected cells  As shown in Fig. 1A , the replicons used in this study expressed two heterologous genes, GFP or a C-GFP fusion under control of the subgenomic promoter followed by the neomycin resistance gene under control of a picornaviral IRES (translation can be from either the genomic or subgenomic RNA). The former construct was termed RUBrep/GFP/neo and the latter was termed RUBrep/ C-GFP/neo. Confocal microscopy of Vero and BHK-21 cells transfected transiently (2-4 days post transfection with no drug selection) revealed that P150 (Fig. 1B) and P90 (not shown), the two replicase components, localize in organelles labelled with antibodies against the lysosomal marker LAMP-1, GFP localizes in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm ( Fig. 1B and C) while the C-GFP fusion localizes in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 1D and E), the site of accumulation of C protein in RUB-infected cells. Doublestranded RNA (dsRNA), an intermediate of RNA replication, also localized with lysosomes ( Fig. 1C and D) , but interestingly was also sometimes on the cell periphery as well, either in association with lysosomes or without apparent association with lysosomes ( Fig. 1E ). Many cells exhibited both patterns of dsRNA distribution, depending on the plane of the micrograph within the cell ( Fig. 1F and G). Similar findings were made with stably transfected cell cultures obtained following drug selection (not shown). Replicons thus assemble RCs in association with lysosomes, similarly to virus-infected cells.   Effect of replicons on organelle distribution  Confocal microscopy was used to study the global distribution of Golgi, mitochondria, lysosomes, RER in control and replicon-transfected cells. No differences were observed between cells transfected with RUBrep/ GFP/neo and RUBrep/C-GFP/neo and thus images from cells transfected with only the latter replicon are shown ( Fig. 2) . Lysosomes are shown in Fig. 2A -C, Golgi and mitochondria are shown in Fig. 2D -F, and RER in Fig. 2G -J; in panels C, F and J, the GFP signal has been subtracted so that organelle distribution can be compared. No significant alterations in the global distribution of lysosomes, Golgi or mitochondria were observed between control and transfected cells. However, the RER signal was weaker in transfected cells, suggesting a fragmentation and spreading of this compartment. EM was used to study regional organelle distribution. As shown in Fig. 2K , in RUBrep/C-GFP/ neo-transfected cells, electron-dense, lysosome-like organelles, putative CPVs (as shown below, these contain both RUB replicase proteins and dsRNA) were surrounded by mitochondria, RER elements and Golgi stacks. Similar results were obtained in RUBrep/GFP/ neo-transfected cells. No differences in global or regional organelle recruitment were observed between transiently transfected or drug-selected cells.  Colocalization of C protein with replicase components  In cells transfected with RUBrep/C-GFP/neo the C-GFP fusion protein colocalized with both P150 and P90 replicase components ( Fig. 3A and B, drug selected cells are shown in these images). Interestingly, in cells with a moderate level of C-GFP expression, the C-GFP signal outlined lysosomes visualized with Lysotracker (this reagent was used because we found that anti-LAMP antibodies labelled Vero lysosomes, but not lysosomes in BHK-21 cells). C-GFP exhibited a more localized pattern around lysosomes in stably transfected BHK-21 cells and apparently the Lysotracker probe had difficulty penetrating some lysosomes that were surrounded by C-GFP (Fig. 3C ). Colocalized C-GFP and replicase occasionally exhibited a filamentous pattern reminiscent of cytoskeletal architecture (Fig. 3D ). While no colocalization of microtubules or intermediate filaments with replicase components was detected (not shown), actin filaments did colocalize with replicase components in both RUBrep/GFP/ neo- (Fig. 3E) and RUBrep/C-GFP/neo-(not shown) transfected cells and with C-GFP in cells transfected with the latter replicon ( Fig. 3F ).  Ultrastructure of replicon CPVs  Stably transfected cultures after drug selection were used for transmission EM after both conventional and freezesubstitution processing and for immunolabelling. Two views of CPVs in RUBrep/C-GFP/neo stably transfected cells are shown in Fig. 4A and B which likely represent a cross-section and a side view respectively. The CPV in Fig. 4A is electron-dense and contains a number of hollow vacuoles while the CPVs in Fig. 4B are characterized by a large vacuole and a long straight element. CPVs in RUBrep/GFP/neo stably transfected cells had a similar morphology (not shown). As a control for the replicontransfected cells, uninfected and RUB-infected BHK-21 cells (24 and 48 h post infection) were similarly analysed ( Fig. 4C and D). Lysosomes in uninfected cells (inset in Fig. 4D ) were electron-dense with some small vesicles occasionally distinguishable (but at a much lower number than in CPVs in replicon-transfected cells) and usually devoid of vacuoles and straight elements and without local recruitment of mitochondria and RER (not shown). However, RUB-infected cells ( Fig. 4C and D) contained electron-dense CPVs with internal vacuoles and straight elements, although these were usually smaller and in lower abundance than in replicon stably transfected cells. Immunogold labelling with antibodies against P150 and P90 replicase components (Fig. 5 ) demonstrated the presence of both proteins in CPVs, which were also labelled by anti-lysosome antibodies (not shown). Thus, these CPVs contain RUB replicon RCs. Both P150 and P90 were associated with both vacuoles and straight elements in the CPVs. Side views of CPVs suggest that straight elements and their replicase proteins are in contact with the cytoplasm ( Fig. 5B and C). To study if RNA replication takes place on the cytosolic or on the lumenal side of the CPVs, transfected cells were treated with streptolysin-O (SLO) to open pores in the plasma membrane without altering intracellular membranes before immunolabelling with anti-dsRNA antibodies ( Fig. 5E -G). Saponin, which permeabilizes all endomembranes, was used in some of the samples as a control. Labelling of the cytosolic domain of TGN38 and the mitochondrial matrix protein Hsp-60 (not shown) served as controls for the permeabilization procedures and confirmed the topological interpretation of dsRNA localization. After saponin treatment an intense signal associated to dsRNA is observed as shown in Fig. 5D . After SLO treatment and immunolabelling before fixation, similar dsRNA signals were obtained but only in permeabilized cells, where free cytosolic GFP has been released ( Fig. 5F and G). These results indicate that RNA replication is taking place on the cytoplasmic side of CPVs.At the EM level dsRNA is also localized in discreet spots of the rigid membranes (Fig. 6A) . Although some C-GFP was detected inside the CPVs in RUBrep/C-GFP/neo stably transfected cells (Fig. 6B ) most of it accumulated in neighbouring cytoplasmic areas (Fig. 6C ). Some C-GFP was also present on the periphery of mitochondria (arrowhead in Fig. 6C ). Views at higher magnification revealed moderate labelling with C-GFP of the internal straight elements inside CPVs (Fig. 6D ). Antibodies specific for the mitochondrial protein P32 concentrated in two locations: a moderate labelling of the interior of mitochondria (Fig. 6E , main field) and weaker labelling of internal vesicles and straight elements of CPVs from RUBrep/C-GFP/neo (Fig. 6E , main field and inset) and RUB/GFP/ neo stably transfected cells (not shown), consistent with small foci of colocalization of P32 and dsRNA observed by confocal microscopy (not shown).When replicon stably transfected cells were processed by freeze substitution, the interior of CPVs was found to have a complex organization, with vacuoles, straight elements and vesicles of variable sizes, some of which appeared to be filled or to contain a central dense core (Fig. 7A-C) . The vesicles were located both along the interior and on the periphery of the CPV. Higher magnification views of the internal straight elements revealed that they are bordered by intensely stained membranes (Fig. 7D ) which sometimes formed closely apposed stacks (Fig. 7E ). When the section plane was parallel to one of these membranes, structures compatible with close-packing in two dimensions (2D) were observed ( Fig. 7F and G) , strongly suggestive of the existence of 2D arrays of proteins in these membranes.Vacuoles and straight elements were characteristic of CPVs in stably transfected cells; however, they were also occasionally observed in lysosomes in control cells. The presence of these elements in lysosomes from control cells, and in CPVs from transiently and stably transfected cells were quantified and reported in Table 1 . Vacuoles and straight elements were present in an about three-to fivefold higher percentage of CPVs in replicontransfected cells in comparison with lysosomes in control cells. RUBrep/GFP/neo transiently transfected cells had a lower percentage of CPVs with vacuoles and straight elements than did RUBrep/C-GFP/neo transiently transfected cells, although the percentage of CPVs in cells stably transfected with these two replicons was similar. viruses manipulating cell organization. It is thought that these complex structures are built by viruses to concentrate key components and increase the efficiency of replication and assembly of new viral particles (Novoa et al., 2005b; Wileman, 2006) . Modified organelles that are specifically labelled for lysosomal markers are the central elements of RUB factories, and RER cisternae, mitochondria and Golgi stacks are among the recruited cellular factors. The architecture of the RCs inside the modified lysosome or CPV and the mechanism of transfer of replicated genomes to the assembly sites in Golgi membranes remain to be elucidated. Towards this end, in this study we investigated RCs in cells transfected with RUB replicons. With replicons, the contribution of the structural proteins can be dissected from the non-structural replicase proteins. Additionally, as the replicons used expressed a GFP reporter gene and an antibiotic resistance gene, transfected cells could be readily identified and drug selection could be used to select a population of cells that uniformly harboured the replicon. We found CPVs in replicon-transfected cells that were modified lysosomes similar in structure to those found in RUBinfected cells, although they were present in greater abundance and appeared to have a more developed internal architecture of vacuoles and membrane-bound straight elements. These elements were also present in a small percentage of lysosomes in control cells and thus the generation of these structures in CPVs may be a normal process stimulated by virus/replicon replication. Interestingly, viral replicase proteins reach the same intracellular location during infection and transfection. The use of replicons is then a valuable strategy to study these early interactions that trigger the formation of the RUB factory and the beginning of viral genome replication in cell membranes.  Viral factories are one of the most interesting examples of  The ultrastructure of CPVs reminds some of the EM images of cellular autophagosomes found in the bibliography (Teckman et al., 2004) . Some viruses replicate in autophagosomes (Jackson et al., 2005; Wileman, 2006) , that are double-membrane vacuoles where cytosol and organelles are sequestered and delivered to lysosomes (Klionsky, 2005) . However, when treating cells transfected with RUB replicons with 3-methyl-adenine, a specific inhibitor of early stages of the autophagic process (Seglen and Gordon, 1982) no decrease in dsRNA signal was observed (not shown). Viruses that use the autophagic machinery induce an increase in the number of autophagic vacuoles and consequently in the signal provided by monodansyl-cadaverine (MDC), a fluorophore specific for autophagic vacuoles under certain fixation conditions (Jackson et al., 2005) . However, in cells transfected with RUB replicons there was no increase in the number of autophagosomes as observed after incubation with MDC (not shown) while Lysotracker signal colocalized with the CPVs (Fig. 3C) . These data would suggest that CPVs are not related to autophagosomes but with modified lysosomes as reported (Magliano et al., 1998) . However, a detailed study should be done at very short times post transfection to study if autophagy is induced by the virus at the very beginning of the life cycle.One of the main aspects of this study is trying to understand the complex structure of the CPVs, in particular where the functional elements are located and working. In order to be able to transfer the replicated genomes to the assembly sites, RCs must have an exit to the cytoplasm. The observation that the rigid membranes containing the replicase proteins and dsRNA are apparently in contact with the cytosol (Figs 4-6) but mainly the detection of dsRNA on the cytosolic side of the CPVs after SLO permeabilizaton (Fig. 5) confirm that viral genome RNA replicated in CPVs must have a direct access to the cytoplasm and consequently to the assembly sites in Golgi membranes that surround the CPVs. C molecules that accumulate around CPVs probably participate in the transfer of viral genomes.The P150 and P90 RUB replicase components and dsRNA localized within CPVs and the RER, mitochondria and Golgi stacks were locally recruited to the CPVs. Similar observations have been made in RUB-infected cells (reviewed in Lee and Bowden, 2000) . As lysosome modification to generate CPVs and organelle recruitment was observed with replicons lacking the C protein, the non-structural replicase proteins by themselves can carry out these functions. Although local organelle recruitment was observed, global organelle recruitment in replicontransfected cells was not, independently of whether the replicon expressed the C protein or not. Beatch et al. (2005) recently reported a global recruitment of mitochondria to perinuclear regions in cells expressing the RUB C protein. However, as such a global recruitment is not observed in RUB replicon-transfected cells, this observation appears to be specific for expression of the C protein alone. Although expression of the C protein by replicons was not necessary for generation of CPVs, in cells transfected with replicons expressing the C protein, colocalization of the C protein with P150 and P90 was detected and the C protein accumulated on the exterior of CPVs. Small amounts of C were also detected inside CPVs. Confocal microscopy suggested that C covered the exterior of some modified lysosomes. The replicon expressed C protein is actually a fusion protein with GFP and we cannot rule out a different behaviour of C-GFP when compared with C alone. However, C-GFP fusions are functional in modulation of replicon RNA synthesis and mutant rescue (Tzeng and Frey, 2003; 2005) and Lee et al. (1999) detected C protein around CPVs by immuno-EM of RUB-infected cells (Lee et al., 1999) . With regard to C-mediated enhancement and modulation of replicon RNA synthesis and mutant rescue, it was recently found that P150 and C can be co-immunoprecipitated (Tzeng et al., 2006) and our finding of colocalization of C, P150 and P90 further confirms an interaction, which may play a role in these C-mediated phenomena. Colocalization of C with P150 was previously reported in RUBinfected cells (Kujala et al., 1999) .In replicon-transfected cells, we also observed colocalization of C, P150 and P90 with actin microfilaments. Kujala et al. (1999) also observed the colocalization of P150 with actin and a considerable disruption of the actin cytoskeleton in RUB-infected cells. It is known that viruses frequently use actin filaments for intracellular transport while some viruses disrupt the actin cytoskeleton to facilitate infection (Cudmore et al., 1997; Dohner and Sodeik, 2005) . Actin could also be a structural component of herpesviruses (Grünewald et al., 2003) and the participation of actin in organizing the sites of mRNA accumulation and synthesis of viral structural proteins has been reported for HIV (Kimura et al., 1996) . The potential role of actin in RUB replication remains to be established. We also detected small amounts of the mitochondrial P32 protein in modified lysosomes and, conversely, C located on the exterior surface of mitochondria. The association of C and P32 was reported by two groups (Beatch and Hobman, 2000; Mohan et al., 2002) and Beatch and Hobman (2000) demonstrated that C and P32 interacted on the periphery of mitochondria in transfected cells expressing C protein. The function of this interaction in RUB replication has not been elucidated although Beatch et al. (2005) recently reported that mutations in the C protein that disrupt the interaction adversely affect virus infectivity. Our results confirm the localization of C to the exterior of mitochondria and are the first demonstration of P32 associated to RUB CPVs. We cannot discard that the presence of P32 inside CPVs could be due to autophagy. However, as P32 is able to leave the mitochondria (Matthews and Russell, 1998; Brokstad et al., 2001) its presence inside CPVs could have a different meaning. It has been proposed that RUB C could interact with P32 shortly before it is translocated into mitochondria or alternatively as it leaves it (Beatch et al., 2005) . On the other hand, our results indicate that C protein would not be necessary for P32 association with RUB RCs because P32 is detected in CPVs when cells are transfected with RUBrep/GFP/neo. These data suggest that P32 could be a structural component of the RUB RC and it is tempting to speculate that P32 could participate in directing C protein to the RC for packaging of the newly synthesized RNA before virus assembly. Further studies will be necessary to clarify these key aspects of RUB replication.Interestingly, confocal microscopy showed that dsRNA, a marker for RNA replication, was not only present in perinuclear lysosomes, but also at the cell periphery, either associated with lysosomes or in the apparent absence of lysosomes. It has been previously reported that both alphaviruses and RUB RCs are secreted by infected cells at extended times post infection (Froshauer et al., 1988; Lee and Bowden, 2000) . It is known that an increase in the intracellular concentration of Ca 2+ above 1 mM induces secretion of conventional lysosomes in many cell types (Rodríguez et al., 1997; Martínez et al., 2000) . This mechanism could be upregulated in infected/ transfected cells. dsRNA detected on the cell surface could be actually contained in CPVs from which specific markers had disappeared on the way to the plasma membrane. This may be a mechanism for cells ridding themselves of virus-specific dsRNA.Ultrastructural analysis of CPVs in replicon-transfected cells revealed an electron-dense interior with variety of internal vesicles and vacuoles, the former of which were filled and the latter of which appeared empty, as well as straight elements bounded by rigid membranes. Although size, shape and organelle association are similar, CPVs in RUB-infected cells described in previous studies (Lee et al., 1994; Magliano et al., 1998; Lee and Bowden, 2000) generally appeared empty. However, the electron density of the CPVs in this study was consistent with the electron density of lysosomes in control cells and the difference is likely due to fixation techniques employed because we used conventional processing with very short dehydration steps or freeze substitution, both of which have been shown to yield superior structural preservation . The filled vesicles we observe likely correspond to the spherules in the CPVs in RUB-infected cells described in previous studies while the large vacuoles and straight elements were absent in CPVs described in these previous studies. In addition to differences in processing, it is also possible that we could have visualized stages in the biogenesis of the CPVs that were missed in these earlier studies.The straight elements frequently observed inside CPVs in replicon-transfected cells were particularly striking. Their rigidity suggested a high protein content and immunolabelling demonstrated that both replicase components were particularly abundant in these membranes while dsRNA and C, while detected, were present in lower amounts. Sectioning along the plane of the membrane revealed an apparent two-dimensional proteinaceous sheet. The potential formation of 2D arrays of viral polymerases has been previously proposed in studies with poliovirus using in vitro transcription assays (Hobson et al., 2001; Lyle et al., 2002) but to our knowledge this has not been previously observed in infected cells. The participation of such arrays in virus or replicon RNA synthesis remains to be established, although the presence of dsRNA indicates that they are active. The availability of drug-selected, uniformly transfected cell lines will allow us to further explore the structure of RUB RCs in CPVs at the molecular level by 3D reconstruction based on serial sectioning and electron tomography.  Generation of replicons  Recombinant DNA manipulations were performed essentially as described (Sambrook et al., 1989) with minor modifications. E. coli JM109 and DH5a were used as the bacterial hosts. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA) or Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN) and used as recommended by the manufacturer. To generate the RUBrep/GFP/Neo and RUBrep/ C-GFP/Neo constructs, a SpeI site was first introduced between the IRES and SP-ORF in siRobo402 (Pugachev et al., 2000) . This intermediate construct, termed siRobo402-SpeI, was generated by a three-round asymmetric PCR followed by a three-fragment ligation (Tzeng and Frey, 2002) . In the first round of PCR amplification, mutagenic oligo 937 (5′-GCTTGCCACAACCACTAGTATGGCTTCTACTAC-3′; SpeI site underlined) was used to prime an asymmetric amplification on a PstI-linearized siRobo402 template. The second round was an asymmetric amplification using the first round PCR product as template and oligo 941 (5′-GCATTCTAGAGTCGCGCTGT CGCG-3′; XbaI site underlined; the sequence is complementary to the nts 6630-6643 of the RUB genome). In the third round, the second round PCR product and oligo IR-5 (5′-CACAATGCATAATTCCGCCCCTCTCCCTC-3′; NsiI site underlined) was used to prime PCR amplification on PstI-linearized siRobo402 template. The NsiI-NotI-digested PCR amplification product was ligated with the NotI-EcoRI fragment from Robo502 (Tzeng and Frey, 2002) and NsiI-EcoRI fragment from siRobo402. The neomycin resistance gene was PCR-amplified from BamHI-restricted pCI-neo template (Promega) with oligos 938 (5′-GCATACTAGTATGATTGAACAAGATGGATT-3′; SpeI underlined) and 943 (5′-TATAAGGCCTTCAGAAGAACTC GTCAAGAA-3′; StuI underlined). The amplified gene was restricted with SpeI and StuI and cloned into siRobo402-SpeI, creating siRobo402-Neo. To generate RUBrep/GFP/Neo and RUBrep/C-GFP/Neo, an NsiI-EcoRI fragment was removed in siRobo402-Neo and was used to replace the corresponding fragments in RUBrep/GFP and RUBrep/C-GFP (Tzeng and Frey, 2002; respectively.  In vitro transcription and transfection  In vitro transcription was carried out as previously described and Vero and BHK-21 cells were transfected with the resulting in vitro transcripts using Lipofectamine 2000 as previously described (Tzeng and Frey, 2002) . By monitoring GFP expression by direct examination of the transfected monolayer with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope with epifluorescence capability, efficiency of transfection was determined to be roughly 30%. To select a population of cells uniformly harbouring replicons, at 4 days post transfection cultures were incubated with medium containing G-418 (1.2 mg ml -1 ). After selection, the cultures were maintained in medium containing G-418 at the same concentration.  Antibodies and fluorescent probes  Rabbit antisera against non-structural proteins P150 and P90 (GU3 for P150, GU8 and GU10 for P90) were previously described (Forng and Frey, 1995) . Rabbit anti-GFP (green fluorescence protein) was provided by Dr David Shima (Imperial Cancer Research Foundation, London, UK). Anti-LAMP-1 antibodies (Carlsson et al., 1988) were kindly provided by Dr M. Fukuda (The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, USA). Anti-giantin antiserum was a kind gift of Dr M. Renz (Institute of Immunology and Molecular Genetics, Karlsruhe, Germany). K2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for dsRNA was kindly provided by Dr N. Lukács (Corvinus University, Budapest, Hungary). Anti-dsRNA J2 mAb was purchased from Biocenter (Szeged, Hungary). Polyclonal antibody specific for P32 mitochondrial protein was a kind gift of Dr W.C. Russell (University of St Andrews, Scotland). mAb specific for PDI (protein disulfide isomerase) was from Sigma. Fluorescent secondary antibodies, Alexa 594, phalloidin 660 (blue), Lysotracker (red and blue) and Mitotracker blue were purchased from Molecular Probes/Invitrogen. Fluorescent secondary antibodies conjugated with Cy5 were from Jackson Immu-noResearch Laboratories.  Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy  Cell monolayers grown on coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed 30 min at 4°C with a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. After washing with PBS, monolayers were permeabilized 10 min at room temperature (RT) with 0.25% saponin before treating 30 min with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.25% saponin. Monolayers were incubated 45 min at RT with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.25% saponin. When antibodies against the P150 and P90 proteins were used, the monolayers were pre-incubated for 10 min with PBS containing 20% goat serum and 0.25% saponin and the primary antibodies diluted in PBS-containing 2% goat serum were added and incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing with PBS samples were incubated 45 min with fluorescent secondary antibodies diluted in PBS/2% goat serum/0.25% saponin (for anti-P150 and anti-P90 primary antibodies) or in PBS/0.1% BSA/0.25% saponin (for the rest of primary antibodies). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with ProLong gold anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). Mitotracker and Lysotracker were added to live cell cultures at a concentration of 200 nM in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. After 45 min at 37°C, the medium was removed and the cells were either washed and mounted on glass slides or fixed and processed for immunolabelling as described above. Specimens were observed using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal laser microscope. Colocalization studies were performed with the program LaserPix (Bio-Rad). White and yellow indicate colocalization.  Permeabilization with SLO and immunofluorescence assays  Cells were processed following previously described procedures (Sodeik et al., 1993) . SLO was purchased from Dr Sucharit Bhakdi's laboratory (Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, Hochhaus am Augustusplatz, Mainz, Germany). The optimal SLO concentration was determined by monolayers of BHK-21 cells grown on coverslips (1 ¥ 10 5 cells per 16 mm coverslip) with different concentrations of SLO (20, 10, 5, 3, 2.5, 2 and 1 mg ml -1 ) and determining the percentage and integrity of permeabilized cells with trypan blue exclusion and light microscopy. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold SLO buffer (25 mM Hepes pH 7,0 with 250 mM sucrose, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 50 mM potassium acetate) containing 2 mM DTT, incubated 15 min on ice with 2 mg ml -1 SLO diluted in the same buffer, washed again with ice-cold SLO-buffer containing 2 mM DTT, incubated 15 min at 37°C to allow pore formation, and then washed three times with SLO buffer to remove the released cytosolic content.For immunofluorescence, SLO-treated cells were incubated 15 min at 37°C with SLO buffer containing 20% calf serum, and then incubated with anti-dsRNA antibodies diluted 1/100 in SLO buffer supplemented with 2% calf serum at 37°C 45 min. After washing three times with PBS, cells were fixed 15 min with 3% PFA in PBS at RT. Cells were washed three times with PBS, and incubated again 15 min with SLO buffer containing 20% calf serum at 37°C, before incubation with the fluorescent secondary antibodies diluted in SLO buffer supplemented with 2% calf serum at 37°C, 45 min. After washing three times with PBS, cells were mounted and studied by confocal microscopy.For a complete permeabilization cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed 15 min with 3% PFA at RT. After washing three times with PBS, cells were processed as above but including 0.25% saponin in all the steps. The rest of the procedure was as indicated.Immunolabelling with antibodies against the cytosolic domain of TGN38 (kindly provided by Dr George Banting from the University of Bristol, UK) and Hsp-60, a mitochondrial matrix protein (purchased from Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada) were used as controls for the two permeabilization procedures and the detection of epitopes exposed to the cytosol or oriented to the lumen of endomembranes.  Transmission EM: ultrastructural studies  Monolayers of control BHK-21 cells, cells transfected transiently (2-4 days post transfection with no drug selection), stably transfected BHK-21 cells (drug-selected) and BHK-21 cells infected 24 or 48 h with the F-Therien strain of RUB at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 1 PFU per cell were chemically fixed with a mixture of 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% tannic acid in Hepes buffer (pH 7.4). All samples were processed by embedding in the epoxy-resin EML-812 (Taab Laboratories, Adermaston, Berkshire, UK) as previously described (Novoa et al., 2005b) . Ultrathin sections were collected on Formvar-coated EM grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. For freeze substitution, cells were fast-frozen in liquid ethane and treated with a mixture of acetone and osmium tetroxide in a automated freeze substitution unit (AFS; Leica-Reichert-Jung, Vienna, Austria) (Risco et al., 2002; . For immunolabelling of proteins and RNA, the substitution medium was methanol containing 0.1% uranyl acetate. Samples were embedded in the epoxy-resin EML-812 (for ultrastructural analysis) or Lowicryl K4M (for immunolabelling) (Salanueva et al., 1999) . Ultrathin sections of approximately 30-40 nm were collected on EM grids and either stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate or processed for immunogold labelling. Samples were studied in a JEOL 1200-EX II electron microscope.  Immuno-EM  Immunogold labelling of proteins was performed by incubating sections with primary antibodies and secondary antibodies, these conjugated with 10 nm colloidal gold (BioCell International, Cardiff, UK) (Risco et al., 2002) . For detecting dsRNA, sections were treated 15 min at 37°C with proteinase K (1 mg ml -1 in Tris-EDTA) before immunolabelling (Salanueva et al., 2003) .  					1			
28374903	RNA sensors of the innate immune system and their detection of pathogens	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165898/	The innate immune system plays a critical role in pathogen recognition and initiation of protective immune response through the recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by its pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Nucleic acids including RNA and DNA have been recognized as very important PAMPs of pathogens especially for viruses. RNA are the major PAMPs of RNA viruses, to which most severe disease causing viruses belong thus posing a tougher challenge to human and animal health. Therefore, the understanding of the immune biology of RNA PRRs is critical for control of pathogen infections especially for RNA virus infections. RNA PRRs are comprised of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, RIG‐I, MDA5, NLRP3, NOD2, and some other minorities. This review introduces these RNA PRRs by describing the cellular localizations, ligand recognitions, activation mechanisms, cell signaling pathways, and recognition of pathogens; the cross‐talks between various RNA PRRs are also reviewed. The deep insights of these RNA PRRs can be utilized to improve anti‐viral immune response. © 2017 IUBMB Life, 69(5):297–304, 2017	Introduction  The innate immune system represents the first line of defense against pathogens through its continuous monitoring of the pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and subsequent activation of a series of defense mechanisms to eliminate the infections. The concept and model of innate immune sensing was first proposed by Charles Janeway Jr. who predicted that there must exist a group of innate immune receptors responsible for recognition and sensing of non-self from self, and triggering subsequent adaptive immunity (1) . Later studies confirmed his prediction and more and more innate immune receptors called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) have been found since then.Based on protein domain homology, PRRs have been divided into several families; they are Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I like receptor (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), AIM2-like receptors (ALRs), and the recently discovered cytosol DNA sensing PRR cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). These PRRs recognize and sense a variety of PAMPs from viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, which range from lipoproteins, carbohydrates, lipopolysaccharide to nucleic acids. PRRs also recognize endogenous damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from host, which is related with both homeostasis and autoimmune diseases. Upon sensing of PAMPs or DAMPs, the PRRs trigger intracellular cell signaling, leading to transcriptional activation and expression of cytokines, chemokines, MHC, and co-stimulatory molecules. Additionally, PRR triggered cell signaling induces several transcription-independent cell processes such as phagocytosis, autophagy, cell death, and inflammasome/cytokine processing, which work together with the transcriptional innate responses (2) .The nucleic acids RNA and DNA have drawn much attention as important PAMPs (3, 4) . Different from non-pathogens, the pathogens including viruses and intracellular bacteria replicate in cells, and nucleic acids RNA or DNA represent the signature of pathogens in particular of viruses which accumulate large amount of nucleic acids during replication in cells. All the nucleic acid detecting PRRs are localized intracellularly. For example, DNA sensing PRRs are endosomal TLR9, cytosolic AIM2, IFI16, and cGAS; RNA sensing PRRs are endosomal TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and cytosolic RIG-I, MDA5, NLRP3, and NOD2. RNA PRRs play more important roles than DNA PRRs in recognition of RNA virus infections and initiation of protective immune responses. RNA viruses exhibit rapid replication kinetics, high mutation rates, and complex evolutionary dynamics, thus RNA viruses pose unique challenges to human and animal health (5) . Most severe disease causing viruses are RNA viruses, such as ebola virus, influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), foot-mouth disease virus (FMDV), etc. Therefore, investigation and understanding of RNA PRRs are critical for control of virus infections and protection of host. Following are the description of individual RNA PRR.  TLRs: TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8  The family of Toll like receptors (TLRs) are the earliest discovered PRRs. Currently human and mouse have 10 and 12 TLRs, respectively: both human and mouse have TLR1-9; in addition, human has TLR10 whereas mouse has TLR11-13 (6) . All TLRs are type I transmembrane proteins and comprised of Nterminal ectodomain or extracellular domain (ECD), middle transmembrane domain (TM) and C-terminal cytoplasmic Toll/ IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain (Supporting Information Fig. 1 ). The ECD contains 20-26 leucine rich repeats (LRR) motifs, which are juxtaposed into a horseshoe-shaped solenoid or a ring-like structure. The a-helix of each LRR is located on the convex surface of solenoid structure, and b-sheet of each LRR assembles and forms into the concave surface of the solenoid structure. Different from other LRR containing proteins, TLRs bind their ligands including agonists on the lateral convex surface instead of concave surface (7) . The formation of M-shaped dimer or multimer is needed for all TLR activation, so that the C-terminal regions of the two TLR ECDs are brought into proximity. It in turn causes the multimerization of cytoplasmic TIR domains, which will recruit downstream adaptors TRIF or MyD88 through homotypic interaction, further forming signaling complex called signalosome and activating downstream transcription factors: one is NF-jB that induces proinflammtory cytokines, another is interferon regulatory factor (IRF) that induces anti-viral type I Interferon (IFN) (6) .TLR3 is widely distributed in all innate immune cells except neutrophils and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and localized in the endosomes of these cells (8) . TLR3 recognizes the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of viruses and the synthetic dsRNA analog poly I:C (9). The crystal structure of TLR3 ECD was the first resolved one among TLR proteins, existing as a monomer of solenoid structure. Upon binding to dsRNA, TLR3 forms a dimer with the backbone phosphates and sugars of dsRNA binding to the lateral positive charged regions of N-and C-terminal ECD (10) . The downstream adaptor TRIF is recruited by activated TLR3 through homotypic interaction, which further forms TRIF signaling complex involving other signaling components, such as TRAF6, TRAF3, TBK1, IKKe, and IKK. The transcription factors IRF3/IRF7 and NF-jB are subsequently activated by the signaling complex and induce the expression of IFN and proinflammatory cytokines, respectively (Fig. 1) .TLR3 recognizes the genomic dsRNA of reoviruses, and the intermediate RNAs generated during replication of different viruses including mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV), herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), flaviviruses, and enteroviruses (Table 1 ). In these cases, the activated TLR3 signaling restricts the virus replication; however, the TLR3 induced inflammation also contributes to the breaching of blood-brain barrier, leading to neuropathologies exemplified as West Nile Virus (WNV) infection in mice (11, 12) .TLR7 and TLR8-belong to the TLR7/8/9 subfamily whose members are all localized at endosomes of the cells. TLR7 and TLR8 are very similar in terms of ligand recognition and intracellular signaling. Both are activated by small molecular agonists and GU or U rich single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) (Fig. 1 ). Small molecular compounds Resiquimod (R848) and CL097 are agonists for both TLR7 and TLR8; however, Imiquimod (R837) and Loxoribine only for TLR7, and CL075 (3M002) only for TLR8. In addition, TLR7 and TLR8 may also recognize short dsRNA such as siRNA from RNA interference (RNAi), and some miRNA such as miRNA-21 and miRNA-29a secreted by tumor cells (13) . The ECDs of TLR7 and TLR8 both have 26 LRR motifs that are more than those of TLR1-6; additionally there are several insertions including the one between LRR14 and LRR15 called undefined region or Z-loop, therefore, the ECDs are larger and exhibit the ring-like crystal structures (14) . The TLR8 and TLR7 at endosome are proteolytically cleaved along the Z-loop by cathepsins and arginine endopeptidase; nevertheless, the two cleaved fragments are still stuck together by multiple intermolecular interactions, and both are required for receptor's activation (15, 16) . The Z-loop cleavage is necessary for TLR8/7 dimerization which is essential for activation (17) . Newly recent crystal structures showed that there are dual agonist binding sites in both TLR7 and TLR8 dimers (18, 19) : one is located within dimer interfaces which binds small chemical agonists or degrade products of ssRNA agonists; another is located on the concave surface of the TLR horseshoe structures and for binding of ssRNA oligonucleotides. The first sites are enough for small chemical agonist induced TLR7 and TLR8 activation, whereas both sites are necessary for ssRNA induced TLR7 and TLR8 activation. At steady state, TLR7 and TLR8 exist as dimers; upon binding to agonists, the conformation of dimers change such that the cytoplasmic TIR domains multimerize and recruit downstream adaptor MyD88 through homotypic interaction. The signaling complex called Myddosome is formed involving IRAK4, IRAK1, TRAF6, TRAF3 and downstream transcription factors NF-jB and IRF7 are activated to induce proinflammatory cytokines and IFNs, respectively.Despite the high similarity between TLR7 and TLR8, the cell distributions of these two are almost opposite: TLR7 is exclusively expressed by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and B cells, whereas TLR8 is expressed mainly in monocytes, macrophages and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), very low level in pDCs and B cells (20) . Both TLR7 and TLR8 are able to recognize multiple virus infections, including sendai virus (SeV), influenza virus, coxsackie virus, vaccinia virus, measle virus (MV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and retrovirus (11) . Furthermore, TLR7 recognizes Streptococcus Group B (SGB) RNA (21, 22) , and TLR8 recognizes the RNAs from Escherichia coli, Mycobacteria bovis, Helicobacter pylori, and Borrelia burgdorferi (23) ( Table 1) .  RLRs: RIG-I and MDA5  RLRs are expressed in almost all mammalian cell types, and as the main family of cytosolic RNA sensors play key roles in The RNA sensors in pathogen detection. The RNA viruses and some bacteria can be recognized by the main RNA sensors inside cells including endosomal TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, cytosolic RIG-I, MDA5, NLRP3, and NOD2. Except NLRP3 which initiates inflammasome formation and processes cytokines for maturation, all others activate downstream NF-jB and IRF signaling pathways, and thus cytokine gene transcription. All these RNA sensor induced signaling together combats pathogen infections.  FIG 1  Chen et al.  299  The summary of cellular localizations and distributions, ligand recognitions, activation mechanisms, cell signaling, recognition of pathogens, and cross-talks for RNA PRRs (2) TLR3 (2) RIG-I (2)The "(1)" and "(2)" denote positive and negative regulation by the corresponding PRRs of the first row of the Fig. 1 ). The optimal RNA recognized by RIG-I is the 5 0 ppp-dsRNA, whereas the one MDA5 prefers is long dsRNA (Fig. 1) . The third member LGP2, lacks of N-terminal 2CARDs, has no signaling activity, but is able to regulate RIG-I and MDA5 signaling due to the capability of binding RNA (24, 25) . RIG-I, as the prototypic member of RLRs, has been subjected to extensive research. Currently, there have been intensive investigations and clear understanding of RIG-I activation mechanism: Under steady state, RIG-I CARDs binds to the Hel-2i region of the helicase and is subjected to auto-inhibition (25) . Upon binding of RIG-I C-terminal RD to RNA, the conformation of RIG-I changes so that the RNA further binds to Hel-2i, and in turn the auto-inhibition of 2CARDs is released. Next, through K63-polyubiquitination/polyubiquitin chain binding of the 2CARDs and/or the filament formation by RIG-I RD-helicase along the dsRNA chain, the 2CARDs are tetramerized into stable lock-washer structure. The effective 2CARD tetramer will nucleate downstream adaptor MASV, which aggregates on the mitochondria into prion-like signaling complex (28) . The downstream TRAF3/TBK1/IKKe and TRAF6/IKK further activate transcription factors IRF3 and NF-jB, which drive IFN and proinflammtory cytokine expression, respectively (29) (Fig.  1) .Consistent with the recognition of short dsRNA ligands, RIG-I specifically recognizes most single-negative RNA viruses which generate lots of short 5 0 ppp-dsRNA during replication. These viruses include but are not limited to ebola virus (EBOV) of filovirus family, measle virus (MV), sendai virus (SeV), newcastle disease virus (NDV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) of paramyxovirus family, influenza virus of othomyxovirus family, hantavirus of bunyavirus family, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and rabies virus (RV) of rhabdovirus family. RIG-I also recognizes positive single RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) of flavivirus family. In addition, RIG-I is able to sense some DNA viruses such as adenovirus, vaccinia virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV) in that these viruses produce small dsRNA through their type III RNA polymerase during replication. There was also report showing that RIG-I can detect the RNA from bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Helicobacter pylori, and Shigella flexneri (30) .MDA5 has a very similar activation mechanism to that of RIG-I: RD-helicase binds with RNA, and conformational change exposes the N terminal 2CARDs, which form tetramer structure. Because MDA5 binds long dsRNA, the 2CARD tetramer is stabilized mainly through the filament formation along the dsRNA, and thus less dependent on K63-polyubiquitination/polyubiquitin chain binding (28) . The effective 2CARD tetramer will nucleate downstream adaptor MAVS, activate TRAF3/ TBK1/IKKe/IRF3 and TRAF6/IKK/NF-jB, which drive IFN and proinflammtory cytokine expression, respectively (29) .MDA5 recognizes long dsRNA, and accordingly senses the single positive RNA viruses such as the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), poliovirus and coxasackie virus of picornavirus family (30) . On the other hand, both RIG-I and MDA5 crossdetect the same viruses; these viruses are double RNA rotavirus of reovirus family, dengue virus, and west nile virus (WNV) of flavivirus family, murine hepatitis virus of coronavirus family (30) ( Table 1) .  NLRs: NLRP3 and NOD2  NLR is also the cytosolic receptor family, which is mainly utilized for detection of bacteria. Human has 22 members, whereas mouse has 34 members. All NLR members have similar domain structures: N-terminal effector domain, middle nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD) and Cterminal leucine rich repeats (LRRs) (Supporting Information Fig. 1 ). Based on the N-terminal effector domains, the NLR is divided into five subfamilies: NLRA (Acid activation domain), NLRB (Baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis repeats), NLRC (Caspase activation and recruitment domain CARD), NLRP (Pyrin domain PYD), and NLRX (Unknown domain) (31) . Except NOD1 and NOD2, all the NLRs upon activation induce the inflammasome formation other than gene transcription.NLRP3, as one of the most extensively studied NLRs, is able to recognize a very broad and distinct set of ligands including ATP, uric acid, silica, adjuvant aluminum, cholesterol crystals, nigericin, pore-forming proteins, mitochondrial DNA, and pathogen mRNA. Common among these stimulators, NLRP3 is activated directly by potassium efflux coupled with downstream NEK7 (32, 33) . Nevertheless, there existed potassium efflux independent non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome formations under conditions of disrupted glycolytic flux or by stimulation of extracellular LPS (33) . Probably, NLRP3 would favor a general sensor of homeostatic disruption such as lysosomal rupture, mitochondria damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ionic imbalance (31) . However, the exact mechanisms of NLRP3 action need to be further investigated and determined. Under steady state, NLRP3 is likely subjected to auto-inhibition; upon activation, NLRP3 binds downstream adaptor ASC and substrate procaspase-1, forming the wheellike structure inflammasome. Next the caspase-1 is activated, processing the pro-IL-1 and pro-IL-18 into active IL-1 and IL-18 (Fig. 1) . NLRP3 recognizes the cytosolic dsRNA/ssRNA of influenza virus and sendai virus, and bacteria mRNA, activating the inflammasome and inducing IL-1 and IL-18 (34-36) ( Table 1) .NOD2 and NOD1 (also called NLRC2 and NLRC1), different from other NLRs, recognize bacterial glycopeptides MDP and ie-DAP, respectively, recruit downstream adaptor RIP2 through homotypic interaction forming signaling complex, and induce NF-jB activation and proinflammatory cytokine expression (31) . NOD2 receptors are found mostly in macrophages, monocytes, paneth intestinal cells, and dendritic cells (37) . Additional studies suggested that NOD2 plays an important role in the restriction of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus (IAV), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), likely through the recognition of virus RNA and subsequent IFN induction (38, 39) (Table 1) . Similar to RLRs, NOD2 has Nterminal 2CARDs, and may tetramerize into washer-locker structure to initiate the adaptor MAVS aggregation and downstream IFN production (38, 40) (Fig. 1) . To this end, the crystal structure of NOD2 CARDs has to be solved in the future (31) .  Other Minor RNA PRRs  TLR13 is only expressed in mouse, and localized in the endosome compartment. Once activated by RNA, TLR13 recruits adaptor MyD88 to trigger transcription factor NF-jB activation and induce proinflammtory cytokine production (22) . Mouse TLR13 was reported to recognize a conserved CGGAAAGACC motif in Staphylococcus aureus 23S rRNA and E. coli 23S rRNA (41, 42) . Furthermore, TLR13 also recognizes Streptococcus pyogenes (43) . In addition to RLRs RIG-I and MDA5, there exists a group of non-RLR RNA helicases which mediate cytosolic RNA recognition and signaling. These are DDX3, DHX9, DHX33, DDX60, and DDX1/DDX21/DHX36 (30, 44) . DDX3 binds poly I:C or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) RNA, associates with RLR-MAVS signaling complex, and enhances IFN response. DHX9 is expressed in mouse spleen dendritic cells and mouse bone marrow dendritic cells, recognizes poly I:C, influenza virus and reovirus RNA, binds with MAVS activating downstream signaling. DHX33 binds poly I:C and reovirus RNA, activates MAVS mediated signaling or NLRP3 mediated inflammasome. DDX60 can be induced by the virus infection, and in the meantime binds the virus RNA, further binds RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2, enhancing RLR signaling and downstream IFN response. DDX1/DDX21/DHX36 are expressed in myeloid dendritic cells, in which DDX1 binds poly I:C through helicase domain, whereas DHX36 and DDX21 bind TRIF TIR domain through their HA2-DUF and PRK domain, respectively. The complex enhances IFN response and exhibits inhibitory effect to influenza virus and reovirus infections. The third minor RNA PRR, leucine-rich repeat flightless-interacting protein 1 (LRRFIP1) was reported to bind both RNA and DNA and be involved in the recognition of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Listeria monocytogene, activate b-catenin, which then translocates into nucleus and promotes IRF3 transcription activity and IFN production (45) .  The Interactions Between RNA PRRs  Interactions of microbes with the innate immune system involve the parallel recognition of different PAMPs of the whole pathogen by multiple PRRs and simultaneous induction of multiple PRR signaling pathways, for which evidence has been accumulated in the past years (46) (47) (48) . Likewise, there are interactions between different RNA PRRs and mutual influence of different RNA PRR signaling. Understanding of the enormous complexity of these processes helps provide insights into in vivo innate immune activation. Within the RNA sensing TLRs, synergistic effects were observed between TLR3 and TLR8 in monocyte-derived macrophages and DCs (49, 50) ; In contrast, TLR8 inhibits TLR7 signaling in both human and mice (51, 52) . Between three subfamilies of RNA PRRs, TLR7/ 8 cooperates with NOD2 in DC activation and results in a synergistic release of pro-inflammatory mediators which promote the activation of Th 17 cells (53) . RLRs suppress the gene transcription of IL-12p40 induced by the activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) including TLR3 and subsequent TLR3 induced Th 1 and Th 17 responses (47) . Furthermore, RLR RIG-I crossinterferes with NOD2 in regulating downstream signaling by direct interaction with each other (54) . The interactions between different PRRs need to be considered in the contexts of distinct species, various cell types, and different agonists used for stimulation.The Ability to Devise Strategies to Control Virus Infections will be Improved with the Knowledge of RNA PRRsThe understanding of RNA PRR immune biology including the ligand recognitions, cellular localizations, cell signaling pathways, mechanisms of activation, recognized pathogens and the interactions between different RNA PRRs will definitely be helpful to improve the anti-viral immune response. We give some examples here: First, based on the ligand recognitions and activation mechanisms of RNA PRRs, RNA varieties and small-molecular agonists of higher potency can be developed for either direct anti-viral therapy or effective viral vaccine adjuvants. Similarly, elucidation of the RNA PRR triggered cell signaling pathways will potentially lead to the discovery of novel innate immune modulators with higher anti-viral efficacy. Second, for certain virus infections, only the RNA PRRs involved in the viral recognition will likely play an important role in the anti-viral immune response; in this case, knowledge of the virus recognition by RNA PRRs becomes critical. Third, TLR3, 7, 8 are primarily expressed by macrophages and DCs and recognize viral RNA within the endosomal compartment, whereas RLRs (RIG-I, MDA5) and NLRs (NLRP3, NOD2) are ubiquitously expressed and sense viral RNA within the cytoplasm of infected cells (Table 1 ). Therefore, it should be considered how to deliver the RNA PRR agonists to host to maximize the anti-viral immune response, such as delivery routes, with or without transfection etc. Fourth, as seen in Table 1 , TLRs have general positive cross-talks with NLRs, whereas RLRs have negative cross-talks with TLRs and NLRs. Even though information is incomplete, this knowledge of crosstalks between different RNA PRRs will provide a rationale to develop appropriate combinations of various agonists/ modulators to control viruses which are simultaneously recognized in vivo by several RNA PRRs. With the information becoming complete, and additional knowledge on how the RNA PRR signaling influences downstream adaptive immune response, more and more effective therapeutics or vaccine adjuvants to control virus infections will be on the horizon.  					1		1	
18041044	Molecular epidemiology and disease severity of respiratory syncytial virus in relation to other potential pathogens in children hospitalized with acute respiratory infection in Jordan	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166429/	Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the major viral cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections in children. Few data about the molecular epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus in developing countries, such as Jordan, are available. The frequency and severity of infections caused by HRSV were assessed in hospitalized Jordanian children <5 years of age compared with other potential etiological agents. Overall a potential pathogen was detected in 78% (254/326) of the children. HRSV was detected in 43% (140/326) of the nasopharyngeal aspirates. HRSV was found more frequently during the winter (January/February), being less frequent or negligible by spring (March/April). Analysis of 135 HRSV‐positive strains using restriction fragment length polymorphism showed that 94 (70%) belonged to subgroup A, and 41 (30%) to subgroup B. There were also two cases of mixed genotypic infection. Only four of the six previously described N genotypes were detected with NP4 predominating. There were no associations between subgroup or N‐genogroup and disease severity. HRSV was significantly associated with more severe acute respiratory infection and the median age of children with HRSV was lower than for those without. Next in order of frequency were adenovirus (116/312: 37%), human bocavirus (57/312: 18%), rhinovirus (36/325: 11%), Chlamydia spp. (14/312: 4.5%), human metapneumovirus (8/326: 2.5%), human coronavirus NL63 (4/325: 1.2%), and influenza A virus (2/323: 0.6%). Influenza B; parainfluenza viruses 1–4, human coronavirus HKU1 and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were not detected. J. Med. Virol. 80:168–174, 2008. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.	INTRODUCTION  Acute respiratory infection is the major cause of death in children <5 years of age, and occurs predominantly in developing countries [Bryce et al., 2005] . Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the leading viral cause of acute respiratory infection in infants and young children in terms of prevalence and effect [Shay et al., 2001] . HRSV causes substantial annual winter epidemics in temperate climates, representing a major cause of pediatric hospitalizations and a serious economic burden [Viegas et al., 2004] . HRSV can cause reinfections throughout the child's life and it can infect infants in the presence of maternal antibodies. This could be due to either an inadequate immune response or to the extensive genetic variability of the virus. Although antigenic variation is not essential for reinfection, growing evidence suggests that it may contribute to reinfections by immune evasion [Viegas and Mistchenko, 2005] . It has also been reported that HRSVspecific T-cell responses do not provide protection against reinfection, and reinfection does not boost HRSV-specific T-cell proliferation [Bont et al., 2002] .HRSV is an enveloped RNA virus that is classified within the Pneumovirus genus as a member of the family Paramyxoviridae [Collins et al., 2001] . The virus has a non-segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense genome. Its genome encodes 10 proteins, including two major surface glycoproteins (G and F), two matrix proteins (M 1 and M 2 ), a small hydrophobic protein (SH), and three nucleocapsid associated proteins (N, P, and L) [Collins et al., 1984] . The two antigenic glycoproteins G and F are responsible for host cell attachment and viral entry by membrane fusion, respectively [Palomo et al., 2000] . HRSV is divided into two major antigenic subgroups, A and B, on the basis of reactivity with monoclonal antibodies against the major structural glycoproteins G and F [Mufson et al., 1985] . However, these two subgroups can be further subdivided into genotypes by restriction analysis and nucleotide sequence variability [Sullender et al., 1993; Peret et al., 1998] . The N (nucleoprotein) gene is relatively well conserved between virus isolates, but the G gene shows much greater variability. The variation in these genes has been used to define HRSV typing schemes as N gene differences resulting in the NP1-NP6 genotypes.The purpose of the present study was to examine the molecular epidemiology of HRSV in Jordan. We also compared the disease severity of HRSV subgroups A and B and their associated genotypes in hospitalized Jordanian children set in the context of other potential respiratory pathogens.  Study Design  This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted over six consecutive months from December 2003 to May 2004. Children younger than 5 years of age with acute respiratory infection admitted to the pediatric wards of King Hussein Medical Centre and Queen Alia Hospital, Amman, Jordan were enrolled in the study irrespective of the severity of their illness. King Hussein Medical Centre, a tertiary referral hospital, and Queen Alia Hospital, a district general hospital, provide hospital pediatric care for Amman, the capital city of Jordan, and its surroundings. The study was approved by the medical research ethical committee of the King Hussein Medical Centre, Amman, Jordan and signed informed consent was obtained from each of the children's parents or legal guardians for participation in the study.The clinical diagnosis of acute respiratory infection and assessment of its severity was made by using the World Health Organization standard protocol for acute respiratory infection based on the presence of cough, tachypnoea, chest indrawing, and wheezing for <7 days duration [Pio, 2003] . Severe disease was defined as present in children with a respiratory rate >60/min and chest indrawing. Oxygen saturation (pO 2 ) was measured by using pulse oximetry (Nellcor Puritan Bennett NPB-195, UK) and a pO 2 85% used as the cut-off for giving supplementary oxygen. A standardized questionnaire containing clinical, socio-demographic, therapeutic, and outcome data was completed for each patient. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected by instilling 1 ml sterile phosphate-buffered saline through a sterile nasopharyngeal mucous extractor. The aspirates were frozen at À808C until analyzed in the Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Liverpool, UK. The genome of HRSV was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [Greensill et al., 2003] . HRSVpositive strains were classified into subgroup A and B by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis [Cane and Pringle, 1992] .  Nucleic Acids Extraction  Total RNA and DNA were extracted separately from nasopharyngeal aspirates by using the commercial RNeasy and QIAamp DNA Mini Kits (Qiagen, Crawley, West Sussex, UK) according to manufacturer's instructions.  Reverse Transcription-Polymerase  Chain Reaction for HRSVThe primers: N1 (5 0 -GGA ACA AGT TGT TGA GGT TTA TGA ATA TGC-3 0 ) and N2 (5 0 -CTT CTG CTG TCA AGT CTA GTA CAC TGT AGT-3 0 ) were used to amplify the nucleocapsid (N) gene between nucleotides 858 and 1,135 giving a 278-bp product [Cane and Pringle, 1991 ].An aliquot of 10 ml of the extracted viral RNA serving as a template for cDNA synthesis was added to 40 ml of PCR mixture. The final 50 ml mastermix reaction contained 1Â PCR buffer, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM dithiothreitol (dTT), 0.4 mM deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), 0.4 mM of primers mixture containing equal volumes of the two primers at a concentration of 20 mM each, 20 units (U) of RNase inhibitor (RNasin), 25 U of murine leukemia virus reverse-transcriptase, and 2.5 U of Amplitaq gold DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics Ltd., Burgess Hill, UK).The RT-PCR was performed in a Perkin Elmer Gene-Amp 2400 thermal cycler (Norwalk, CT) according to the following program: 30 min reverse transcription cycle at 508C, followed by 5 min reverse transcriptase inactivation and DNA polymerase activation cycle at 948C, then forty PCR cycles (1-min denaturation at 948C, 1 min of primer annealing at 558C, and 1 min of primer extension at 728C), and a final extension cycle of 728C for 10 min.Ten microliter volumes of each amplified DNA PCR product were separated by electrophoresis on a 2% (wt/ vol) agarose-Tris-Borate-ethylene diamine tetracetic acid gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under ultraviolet light (Syngene Gel Documentation and Analysis System, Ingenius, Cambridge, UK).  Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism  Analysis of HRSV Aliquots of 2 ml from HRSV positive amplified DNA were separately digested directly and without prior purification by a set of five restriction endonuclease enzymes namely HindIII, PstI, BglII, RsaI, HaeIII (Roche). The restriction patterns were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% (wt/vol) agarose-tris-borateethylene diamine tetracetic acid gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under ultraviolet light. HRSV amplicons were typed into six nucleoprotein (NP) genotypes on the basis of their restriction endonuclease digestion profiles [Cane and Pringle, 1992] . HRSV subgroup A included NP2, NP4, and NP5, while subgroup B included NP1, NP3, and NP6 genotypes.  Detection of Other Respiratory Pathogens  Detection of other respiratory pathogens was performed according to previously published protocols. RT-PCR was used for the detection of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) [Greensill et al., 2003] , influenza A and B, and parainfluenza virus 1-4 [Templeton et al., 2004] , human rhinovirus (HRV) and human coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1 [Choi et al., 2006; Sloots et al., 2006] . PCR was used to detect human bocavirus (HBoV) [Allander et al., 2005] , adenoviruses, Chlamydia spp., and Mycoplasma pneumoniae [Couroucli et al., 2000] .  Statistical Analysis  Epi Info Version 3.3.2 (Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA) was used for statistical analysis by applying Chi-Square and Student's t-tests. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.  RESULTS  A total of 326 children (188, 58% male) with a median age of 5 months were recruited, and 326 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected and analyzed, however the volume of some nasopharyngeal aspirates was inadequate for both DNA and RNA extractions. Of the 326 children studied 15 (5%) had some underlying condition which might have contributed to disease severity. Of these 13 had cardiopulmonary disease, predominantly congenital heart disease (but none had bronchopulmonary dysplasia), one was premature and one had immunodeficiency. In all 8 (53%) of those with an underlying condition had severe disease. A total of 72/326 (22%) patients had no pathogens detected by PCR (Table I) , but 254 (78%) had at least one potential respiratory pathogen detected which consisted of 140/ 326 (43%) HRSV, 116/312 (37%) adenoviruses, 57/312 (18%) HBoV, 36/325 (11%) rhinovirus, 14/312 (4.5%) Chlamydia spp., 8/326 (2.5%) HMPV, 4/325 (1.2%) human coronavirus NL63, and 2/323 (0.6%) influenza A virus. Overall 106/326 (33%) infants had mixed infections (Table II) and of these 83 were infected with 2 potential pathogens, 22 with 3, and 1 with 4 potential pathogens. A total of 67 HRSV co-infections (48% of all HRSV infections) were detected; 30 with adenoviruses, 10 with HBoV, 10 with adenovirus and HBoV, 8 with rhinoviruses, 3 with Chlamydia spp., 1 with rhinovirus and HBoV, 1 with Chlamydia spp. and adenovirus, 1 with Chlamydia spp. and HBoV, 1 with Chlamydia spp. and rhinovirus, 1 with adenovirus and rhinovirus, and 1 with Chlamydia spp., rhinovirus and HBoV. No HRSV/HMPV co-infections were detected. Influenza B, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, human coronavirus HKU1 and M. pneumoniae were not detected in this study.Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed for 98% (137/140) of HRSV-positive strains; three weakly positive strains were not subjected to further subgrouping analysis. HRSV subgroup A was detected in 70% (94/135) and subgroup B in 30% (41/135) of the samples. There were two cases of mixed genotypic infections, one NP2/NP4 (A/A) and one NP4/NP3 (A/B). Genotyping analysis of HRSV strains showed that 63 (47%) were NP4, 31 (23%) NP2, 26 (19%) NP1, and 15 (11%) NP3. Each of the four genotypes co-circulated during the January-March period of the study (Table III) .All the children in the study had lower respiratory tract infections mainly bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia and routine cultures of their blood and respiratory secretions had detected no potential bacterial or fungal pathogens. Although there were no deaths, three children were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, one infected only with HRSV subgroup B (NP1), one infected only with HBoV, and one who had congenital heart disease with no pathogens detected. A total of 139 (43%) children had severe, and 187 (57%) had mildmoderate acute respiratory infection. Significantly (P < 0.0005) more HRSV-infected children had severe disease (100/140; 71%) compared to those uninfected with HRSV (39/186; 21%). The median age of HRSVinfected patients was 4.8 months (range 1-48 months) and 82 (59%) were male, compared with a median age of 6 months and 104 (56%) male patients in the HRSVnegative patients (P < 0.05). Severe HRSV infections occurred in all age groups, however it was significantly more likely to occur in those under 6 months of age (P < 0.01). Thus 62 (62%) in the 0-6 months age group, 30 (30%) in the 7-12 months group, and 8 (8%) in those older than 1 year had severe disease. HRSV subgroup A and B were associated with 66 and 33 cases of severe disease, respectively (P ¼ 0.2). There was no significant difference between the individual HRSV genotypes as potential causes of severe disease.In the 100 patients with severe acute respiratory infection in whom HRSV was detected, it was the sole pathogen detected in 53 (53%) patients, however in the remaining 47 cases, it was found as a mixed infection with adenovirus (20 patients), HBoV and adenovirus (9 patients), HBoV (8 patients), Chlamydia spp. (3 patients), rhinovirus (2 patients), HBoV and rhinovirus (1 patient), Chlamydia spp. and HBoV (1 patient), Chlamydia spp. and adenovirus (1 patient), adenovirus and rhinovirus (1 patient), and Chlamydia spp., HBoV and rhinovirus (1 patient). There was no significant difference (P > 0.5) in the prevalence of severe disease between those where HRSV was the sole pathogen (53/ 73:73%) and those with HRSV and another potential pathogen (47/67:70%). The median age of children with severe acute respiratory infection was 4 months for those infected only with HRSV, and 6 months for those co-infected with HRSV and other potential respiratory pathogens (P < 0.05). In the 40 patients with mildmoderate acute respiratory infection in whom HRSV was detected, it was the only pathogen in 20 (50%) patients, however in the remaining 20 cases, it was found as a mixed infection with adenovirus (10 patients), rhinovirus (6 patients), HBoV (2 patients), adenovirus and HBoV (1 patient), and Chlamydia spp. and rhinovirus (1 patient). The median age of children with mild-moderate acute respiratory infection was 4 months for those infected only with HRSV, and 9.5 months for those co-infected with HRSV and other potential respiratory pathogens (P ¼ 0.05).Of the 36 children infected with rhinovirus 24 (67%) had mild/moderate and 12 (33%) severe disease. The median age of those infected with rhinovirus was 4.5 months not significantly different from that of those infected with HRSV. Although 12 of the children infected with rhinovirus had severe disease, only one of these severe infections occurred in the absence of coinfection with any of the other eleven potential respiratory pathogens. Of the 24 children with mild/moderate disease 17 (71%) were co-infected with other pathogens. There was a similar prevalence of rhinovirus infection in January-April.   DISCUSSION  This study has confirmed that HRSV is the most frequent cause of severe acute respiratory infection in young children in Jordan. The fact that a large proportion of HRSV infections (71%) were associated with more severe disease is not unexpected because only hospitalized patients were involved in this study. However significantly more hospitalized infants with severe respiratory disease than mild/moderate disease due to HRSV were detected compared to infection with the other potential pathogens.Worldwide, two subgroups of HRSV circulate independently within human populations, with group A being the more prevalent [Peret et al., 2000] . In a 3-year study conducted in the USA [Walsh et al., 1997] , group B viruses predominated for 2 years, while group A predominated in the third year. Information on the relative frequencies of subgroups A and B in the Middle East and Africa is scarce. In the present study, subgroup A was predominant (70% vs. 30%), as previously shown in Jordan [Bdour, 2001] , and Yemen [Al-Sonboli et al., 2005] . This predominance of subgroup A HRSV is the most common pattern worldwide [Cane, 2001] .Only four of the six previously described N genotypes [Fletcher et al., 1997] were found among the HRSV strains. All four genotypes were identified during the January-March period of the study, with genotype NP4 predominating (Table II) . However all four genotypes co-circulated at the same time. Some authors have concluded that infection with group A HRSV is associated with more severe disease [Peret et al., 2000] but others have found no such association [Fletcher et al., 1997; Walsh et al., 1997 ]. In the present study HRSV subgroup A infection was not associated with more severe disease than infection with subgroup B (Table III) . The medical staffs were unaware of group and genotype results and thus potential bias leading to a differential misclassification of the disease severity is unlikely.Although the study extended through only 6 months of the year, there was a demonstrable peak of acute respiratory infection due to HRSV during January and February, as shown in a previous study in Jordan [Al-Toum et al., 2006] . HRSV was less frequent or almost absent in March-May.HRSV-infected children were significantly younger than HRSV-negative children, and severe HRSV infections most frequently (90%) affected children younger than 12 months of age in agreement with a previous report from Jordan [Meqdam and Nasrallah, 2000] . Although it has been shown previously that children infected with group A HRSV were significantly older than were those infected with group B HRSV [Hall et al., 1990] , there was no significant difference in the ages of these groups (P ¼ 0.2) in the present study.There were no significant differences between the different HRSV genotypes as potential causes of severe disease, so it was difficult to establish a relationship between genotypes and disease severity.Overall 102 (31.2%) of the children had more than one potential pathogen detected in their nasopharyngeal aspirates. This is perhaps not surprising as the respiratory viral seasons often co-incide [Choi et al., 2006] , and increasing the range of potential pathogens sought (in this study 10 viral and 2 bacterial pathogens) will reveal more co-infections. In 68 children the copathogens were HRSV with one or more other pathogen. However in no case was a co-infection with HRSV and HMPV encountered. Such co-infection has previously been linked with more severe acute respiratory infection in some [Greensill et al., 2003; Semple et al., 2005; Foulongne et al., 2006] but not all studies [Maggi et al., 2003; Wilkesmann et al., 2006] . HMPV was less frequently detected (2.5% of cases) than in some other hospital based studies [Al-Sonboli et al., 2005; Semple et al., 2005] . However the peak prevalence of HMPV infections does seem to vary year by year and the HRSV and HMPV seasons are not always concurrent [Serafino et al., 2004; Choi et al., 2006] .After adenovirus the second most common HRSV copathogen was the newly described HBoV. The finding of HBoV in Jordanian children has already been reported [Kaplan et al., 2006] . It was infrequently found as sole pathogen which suggested that further studies were needed to assess its role as a respiratory pathogen. However recent report from Edinburgh, UK has demonstrated that it is an important respiratory pathogen in children and not found in children without acute respiratory infection [Manning et al., 2006] .Adenoviruses were detected in 116 of the 312 children (37%), a prevalence that is significantly higher than those reported recently from Germany (12.9%), Brazil (6%), and India (1.5%) [Grondahl et al., 1999; Maitreyi et al., 2000; Straliotto et al., 2002] . However only the German study used RT-PCR. The latter two employed immunofluoresence and viral culture, respectively. In 75 (65%) of the cases of adenovirus infection it was found together with another potential pathogen. The German study showed that in 5% of the cases when an agent was detected there was more than one potential pathogen and in most cases this was adenovirus with another pathogen [Grondahl et al., 1999] . It is unclear why we had such a high detection rate of adenovirus infection and it warrants further study.Rhinoviruses were the fourth commonest respiratory pathogen detected (36:11%). This prevalence is double that (5.8%) described for lower respiratory tract infections in Korean children [Choi et al., 2006] but somewhat lower than that (44%) found recently in Australia . Rhinovirus was present as a copathogen in 24 (67%) of Jordanian children whereas in Australia in almost one-third of the rhinovirus infections a co-pathogen was detected . HRVs are well-recognized causes of upper respiratory tract infection. However in the Australian study it was detected in almost half the samples from patients with lower respiratory tract infection , again somewhere higher than the 11% prevalence in Jordanian children, Hayden [2004] has recently reviewed the role of rhinoviruses in lower respiratory tract infection and found that they were responsible for between 12% and 24% of such infections in children. In one study it was present as a co-pathogen in almost 50% of infections [Papadopoulos et al., 2002] .Better therapies and prevention strategies are needed to decrease the burden of acute respiratory infection particularly that due to HRSV. Thus further molecular epidemiological studies over longer periods of time are warranted to better determine the role of the different HRSV genotypes in the epidemiology and the severity of disease and their inter-relationship with other respiratory pathogens. This could inform better therapeutic approaches and vaccine development.  				1	1			
21418390	Spongiform degeneration induced by neuropathogenic murine coronavirus infection	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167946/	Soluble receptor‐resistant mutant 7 (ssr7) is isolated from a highly neurovirulent mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) JHMV cl‐2 strain (cl‐2). srr7 exhibits lower virulence than its maternal strain in infected mice, which is typically manifested in a longer lifespan. In this study, during the course of infection with srr7, small spongiotic lesions became apparent at 2 days post‐inoculation (pi), they spread out to form spongiform encephalopathy by 8 to 10 days pi. We recently reported that the initial expressions of viral antigens in the brain are detected in the infiltrating monocyte lineage and in ependymal cells. Here, we demonstrate that the next viral spread was observed in glial fibrillary acidic protein‐positive cells or nestin‐positive progenitor cells which take up positions in the subventricular zone (SVZ). From this restricted site of infection in the SVZ, a large area of gliosis extended deep into the brain parenchyma where no viral antigens were detected but vacuolar degeneration started at 48 h pi of the virus. The extremely short incubation period compared with other experimental models of infectious spongiform degeneration in the brain would provide a superior experimental model to investigate the mechanism of spongiotic lesions formation.	  Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) are characterized by neuronal loss, vacuolation, and, in most cases, accumulation in the central nervous system of causative agents such as abnormal prion protein (Prp Sc ). 1 However, in sheep scrapie, there is no significant neuronal loss and relationships between different magnitudes, topographical and cytological forms of Prp Sc accumulation, and clinical signs are not evident. 2 Furthermore, it has long been recognized that vacuolation is not always a prominent feature of the pathology of scrapie-affected sheep and mice with neurological disturbances. 3 Therefore, questions still remain to be answered, especially regarding the mechanisms and roles of spongiform degeneration in TSE, which show variable neurological and neuropathological features depending upon infectious agents and infected species. 4 The common neuropathology observed in and around the spongiotic area is astroglial and microglial cell activation after infection with Prp Sc , 1, 5 or with other infectious agents such as neuropathogenic murine retroviruses. 6, 7 The scrapie-infected cell homogenate triggers the recruitment of microglial cells by interacting with both neurons and astrocytes through upregulation of the expression levels of a broad spectrum of neuronal and glial chemokines very soon after the infection, before amyloid aggregates of the pathological prion protein become apparent. 5 A8 virus, a neuropathogenic murine retrovirus strain isolated from Friend leukemia virus, 8, 9 causes spongiosis accompanied by microgliosis in the rat brain after infection at birth. 7 The viral antigens are mainly detected in the blood vessel walls of infected brains, 10, 11 or in the endothelial cells of brain tissue culture. 12 The viral antigens on blood vessel walls are distributed throughout the whole brain and spinal cord of infected rats and are not correlated with the distribution of spongiotic areas. A closer association of the lesions with viral antigen expression has been observed in the infected and activated microglia. 6 In this report, we describe a neuropathogenic strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-induced spongiform encephalopathy after the infection of mice. We recloned the srr7 (H2) virus (see Materials and Methods) from viral stock prepared as a soluble receptor-resistant (srr) mutant, clone srr7, 13 isolated from a highly neuropathogenic MHV JHM strain, cl-2. 14,15 srr7 (H2) induced spongiosis within a short incubation period, at 48 h post-inoculation (pi). Furthermore, the viral antigens, which are detectable during the early phase of infection (between 12 and 24 h pi) in the inflammatory cells, appeared in meninges and ependymal cells without spreading into the brain parenchyma including the virus injection sites. 16 They were detected in the nestin-positive immature cells beneath the ependymal cells at 48 h pi when spongiosis became apparent, in spongiotic lesions no viral antigens were detectable. In addition, in the subventricular zone (SVZ) beneath the ependymal cells, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes projecting cell processes to the ependymal cell layer were found to be infected. In the developing mouse brain, the migrating neuroblasts (type A cells) advance as chains through tubes defined by the processes of slowly proliferating SVZ astrocytes, 17 commonly referred to as type B cells, which develop as the primary neuronal precursors in the SVZ of adult mice, 18 besides contributing to the niche environment together with macrophages and endothelial cells. 19 The neuronal stem progenitor cells in developing brains are targets of infection for viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), 20 coxsackievirus, 21 and Simian immunodeficiency virus. 22 In adult brains, neural precursor cells in the ependymal wall are susceptible to murine CMV infection. 20 However, none of the viruses induce spongiotic lesions. Possible mechanisms of spongiogenesis after infection with srr7 to neural precursor cells in the ependymal wall are discussed.  Animals and viruses  Specific pathogen-free inbred BALB/c mice purchased from Charles River (Tokyo, Japan) were maintained according to the guidelines set by the ethics committee our university. At 5 weeks old, each mouse was injected with 1x10 2 of the srr7 virus into the right frontal lobe under deep anesthesia.Since srr7 is isolated from the cl-2 virus, 13 the virus has long been maintained by several passages on DBT cells. 23 In order to eradicate the possible contamination of a mutant virus emerging during long and repeated passages, the virus stock was recloned by limiting dilution. The virus was used to infect DBT cells in the wells of 96-well tissue culture plates at a concentration of 0.1-0.01 plaque-forming units (PFU) per well. At 24 h after infection, the culture supernatant in wells in which a single and distinct plaque was observed was transferred to naïve DBT cell culture medium in 24-well plates. After three passages to obtain an adequate amount of the cloned viral stock for further experiments, the S proteincoding region of each clone was sequenced after amplification of the S gene employing a reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR), as described previously. 24 A clone, designated as srr7 (H2), was selected for further experiments because it gave rise to a high titer viral production in DBT cells without showing changes in the amino acid sequence in the region of the S protein, although point mutations of the coding region for the S protein were detected at positions 528 (A to C) and 1578 (T to C) as silent mutations, without resulting amino acid substitutions. The stability of the recloned virus regarding virulence and pathogenicity was tested and compared with those obtained from 15 and 21 mice infected in 2007 and 2009, respectively. DBT cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM; Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Japan Bioserum, Hiroshima, Japan) and cultured at 37°C with humidity in 5% CO2, as described previously. 25  Immunostaining and neuropathology  After exsanguination of the infected animals under deep anesthesia, removed parts of the brain were frozen for viral titration and the remaining portions were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde buffered with 0.12 M phosphate (PFA) to obtain paraffin-embedded sections for histological staining with HE or HE and luxol fast blue, and for enzyme immunohistochemistry. 7 Viral antigens were visualized using the rabbit polyclonal antibody, SP-1, or mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb). 25, 26 Rat antimouse F4/80 either unlabeled or biotin-conjugated (Serotec, Oxford, UK and eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA, respectively), rat antimouse CD11b biotin-conjugated (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), rabbit or mouse anti-GFAP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA and Sigma, Tokyo, Japan, respectively) were used for cell identification. As a second or third application, biotinylated donkey antirabbit IgG (Amersham, Tokyo, Japan), goat antimouse IgG (Cappel, Solon, OH, USA), biotin-conjugated donkey antimouse IgG (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA, USA), rabbit peroxidase antiperoxidase complexes (Cappel,), or avidin-peroxidase conjugate (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR, USA) was used, as described previously. 16 After deparaffinization, sections were incubated with 50% normal horse or 50% normal mixed serum (fetal calf, calf, pig, and horse) diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) prior to the first antibody application to block non-specific antibody binding. The non-specific activity of endogenous peroxidase was blocked after primary antibody incubation by incubating sections with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol. Washes in PBS were carried out between each step. For the peroxidase reaction, 0.2 mg/mL 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) (Wako, Osaka, Japan) in 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 7.6) was used to obtain brown staining. For double staining, horseradish peroxidase localization was revealed using 4-chloro-1naphthol (Wako) substrate, resulting in purple staining.The degree of spongiform neurodegeneration was scored as follows: 6 0, no lesions; 1, less than 20 vacuoles in the total area; 2, 20 to 100 vacuoles counted in the light microscopic field at 10 ¥ magnification (field (X10)); 3, clusters consisting of over 100 vacuoles spread within one field (X10); 4, more than two clusters consisting of over 100 vacuoles in the area, or clusters of vacuoles occupying over 30% of the total area. Intermediate scoring between each of the five established scores was permitted by adding a value of 0.5 to the lower score. To score the CNS pathology, five areas were selected: the frontal hemisphere, thalamus, cerebellum, pons, and spinal cord.  Tissue preparation for immunofluorescence  At desired time points after infection, mice were deeply anesthetized, followed by a two-stage perfusion. Mice were first perfused with 1 mL of PBS followed by 10 mL of paraformaldehyde (4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.2)) from the aorta via the left ventricle. Brains were fixed in 4% PFA overnight, followed by immersion in PBS for 1 h on a rotator (Iuchi Seieido Inc., Osaka, Japan). The tissues were then rinsed stepwisely in PBS or sterilized water supplemented with increasing concentrations of sucrose (Wako), followed by a final rinse with 25% sucrose. All steps were performed at 4°C in a rotator (TAAB Laboratories, Reading, UK). Tissues were isolated and embedded in OCT compound (Sakura, Tokyo, Japan). Tissue blocks were frozen in dry ice. Sections of 10 mm were cut using a cryostat (Sakura), air dried, and stored at -80°C until stained.Fluorescence double immunostaining was performed using combinations of rabbit anti-nestin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) with mouse monoclonal antibody H-4. Cryosections were treated with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma), 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma), 0.1% sodium azide, goat antimouse IgG (Cappel), and 5% horse serum for blocking. After incubation in a combination of primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, the sections were thoroughly washed with PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20. They were then incubated with FITC-antirabbit IgG antibody (Abcam, Tokyo, Japan) or biotin-antimouse IgG antibody (Rockland) and avidin-Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probe) for 30 min at room temperature. Stained sections were mounted with gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and examined using a fluorescent microscope (Keyence, Osaka, Japan).  Viral property  When we published our first report on the neuropathology induced by cl-2 and srr7, 25 we were already aware that spongiotic lesions were induced by srr7 infection in mice.However, we did not describe this neuropathology because the occurrence of the change was not constant (data not shown) when we used viruses derived from the original stock 13 and maintained in our laboratory through passages in DBT cells. The highly mutative nature of MHV 27 causes a tendency in mutant viruses to revert to the original neurovirulent phenotype. 28 srr7, a mutant isolate from cl-2 as a ssr strain, has, to some extent, been showing slightly higher neurovirulence, like its maternal strain (data not shown), whereas averaged neurovirulences and neuropathological characteristics have shown no significant changes. Therefore, we started recloning the virus strain and obtained srr7 (H2), which had the same amino acid sequence as the original isolate 13 in the region of the viral surface protein (S protein; see Materials and Methods). Although there could be mutations in the other coding or non-coding regions, which might influence the neurovirulence or host reactions, [29] [30] [31] after examination of the viral genome sequence coding S protein, we decided to use srr7 (H2) to study spongiosis induced by viral infection because srr7 differs from cl-2 only in one amino acid sequence in the S protein-coding region, 23 and, more importantly, the virus exhibited the same induction rate of spongiosis with a similar intensity between the experiments performed in 2007 and 2009 (Fig. 1) . After the recloning of srr7 in 2007, we performed our experiments using viruses in five passages after the initial cloning. Incidences of spongiotic degeneration and virulence in mice infected with srr7 were compared from the experiments carried out in 2007 and 2009 (Fig. 1) , because we considered the virus to be highly mutative (see Discussion). All of the 15 and 21 mice infected in 2007 and 2009, respectively, survived for the initial 3 days and died within 12 days pi (data not shown). Furthermore, in all of the neuropathologically examined animals, large spongiotic lesions composed of various sizes of vacuole became apparent 4-5 days after viral inoculation mainly in the pons, cerebellum, and thalamus (Figs 1,2) , the lesions were less extensive in the frontal area (Fig. 1 ) among the animals examined and compared in 2007 and 2009.  Characteristics of spongiosis  When spongiosis occupied an extended area (Fig. 2h ) scored as grade 4 (see Materials and Methods), we designated the spongiotic lesion as extensive spongiosis (exSpongi) to distinguish this from less extensive spongiotic lesions scored grade 1 or 2, and named vacuolar lesions (vacLesions). In vacLesions each vacuole looked smaller and some vacuoles showed back-to-back attachment forming bunches (Fig. 2b,j) , each of which consisted of less than 100 vacuoles. The exSpongi exhibited several neuropathological characteristics. First, the lesion was fairly well-demarcated (Fig. 2h) . Second, the lesions were accompanied by few or no inflammatory reactions. This phenomenon occurs rather rarely in viral infections with apparent destructive lesions. At a lower magnification of exSpongi, many small nuclei were observed (Fig. 2h) , many of which were pyknotic and devoid of cytoplasm at a higher magnification (Fig. 2i) . We were unable to characterize the remainder, except for a few macrophages present in the lesions (black arrows in Fig. 2i ). Around the blood vessels in and around the exSpongi, almost no inflammatory cell exudation was observed either at the capillary level or at a larger size (thin white arrows in Fig. 2h-j) , including in the area with myelinated fibers (Fig. 2j) . The third neuropathological characteristic of exSpongi was that neurons looking viable were found in the lesion (white arrowheads in Fig. 2h,i) , where vacuoles attached to the neurons directly. The neurons were also well-preserved in vacLesions around the exSpongi (Fig. 2h,j) . The close association of small vacuoles with thick eosinophilic walls and the neurons (white arrowheads in Fig. 2i ) resembles the vacuoles formed in murine retroviral infection, 9 in which the vacuoles are shown as enlarged presynaptic bulbs. 8  Distribution of viral antigens  The viral antigens were more strongly expressed around the exSpongi than inside (Fig. 2 m,n) . Although the initial viral antigen expression was detected in the inflammatory cells in the meninges as early as 12 h pi, followed by infection to the choroid plexus and ependymal cells, as reported previously 16 and shown in Fig. 2a ,c, they were eliminated from ependymal cells and the SVZ in the latter phase of infection (Figs 2 m,3 ). In addition, facing the ventricles a repaired line of ependymal cells with flattened cytoplasm and few cilia was observed (data not shown). Another trace of initial events could be detected as the pronounced activation of GFAP-positive glial cells in and around the SVZ. The gliosis was found to extend deep into the brain parenchyma and again in the middle of the exSpongi (black arrowheads in Fig. 2k ) GFAP-antigen expression was less extensive than that seen in the surrounding vacLesions. Even in this area with mild gliosis, astroglial foot processes around the blood vessels were an outstanding feature (Fig. 2l) , indicating that a key component of the blood brain barrier had been well-preserved in the exSpongi during the course of the disease, which conspicuously contrasts with pathologies involving an inflammatory perivascular cuff induced by infection with other strains of JHM virus, where there is a disappearance of astrocytes around blood vessels with inflammation followed by degeneration of the astrocytes with swollen cytoplasm around the blood vessels in the initial phase of cell infiltration. 32 To study vacuolar formation during the early phase of infection, we investigated infected mice at 48 h pi, because the viral antigens are distributed only in the restricted area 16 at this time while vacLesions become apparent (Fig. 2b,g) . Vacuolar degeneration was already detectable before 48 h pi, but the number of vacuoles and magnitude were so low that it was sometimes difficult to distinguish from an artifact produced during the preparation of sections (data not shown). In Fig. 2a (the dotted area with the letter b and arrow) a distinct vacLesion developed (Figs 2b,3) , but viral antigens were not detectable in this area or in the area between the boxed area and ependymal cells which expressed the viral antigens. Occasionally viral antigenbearing cells in the SVZ were observed extending their cytoplasm to the ventricle (black arrow in Fig. 2c) . We considered these to be B cells, GFAP-positive precursor cells resident in the SVZ, so we carried out double staining of serial sections next to the stained section (Fig. 2c) . As shown in Fig. 2e , a GFAP-positive cell projecting its cytoplasm to the ventricular surface was infected. Nestin-positive precursor cells in the SVZ were also infected (Fig. 2o) .Astroglial activations were most prominent in the area near the very restricted site of infection around the ventricle, already during this early stage of infection gliosis was found extending deep into the brain parenchyma, like in the later stage but in a less extensive manner (Fig. 2d) . Interestingly, in the cerebellum, the area of gliosis abruptly ended at the border of the granular layer (indicated by black arrowheads in Figures 2d and f) . The vacLesion also finished there. At a lower magnification, the activated astrocytes looked scattered and unrelated to the vacuoles observed in the region of gliosis (Fig. 2f) , but a higher magnification revealed fine fibrous or dot-like structures exhibiting GFAP-antigens facing the vacuolar walls (Fig. 2g) .  DISCUSSION  The distribution of spongiotic lesions showed a predilection for the brainstem and cerebellum (Figs 1,2 ) without forming spongiosis in the SVZ (Figs 2,3) , although our previous report demonstrated that the viral antigens in the brain appear in the choroid plexus and SVZ, including ependymal cells, during the early phase of infection after the initial emergence in infiltrating cells of meninges at 12 h pi, without spreading into the brain parenchyma including the site of injection. 16 In addition, the frontal area where the viruses were inoculated contained less extensive lesions compared to the brainstem (Fig. 1 ) and the brain cortex facing the subarachnoid space where infected inflammatory cells are abundant is not the initial site of invasion of srr7 into the brain parenchyma. 16 Furthermore, the brain cortex including the frontal area was not the main area of lesions induced by infection of srr7 during the later phase. 16, 25 It is indicated that the viral spread into the brain starts from the junctional area between the arachnoid and choroid plexus where viral antigens are detected during the initial phase of infection. 16 Therefore, our studies on the relationship between the viral antigen distribution and formation of vacuolar degeneration have mainly focused on the periventricular and surrounding areas in the brainstem. Surprisingly, at 48 h pi, we found large vacLesions where viral antigens were not detected ( Fig. 2b-g) . On the same section as the vacLesions were detected and on successive serial sections, viral antigens were found only in restricted areas, as in the SVZ, where GFAP-positive cells with a peculiar shape, projecting narrow cytoplasm to the ventricular surface and leaving their perikaryon beneath the surface-lining ependymal cells, were found to have been infected (Fig. 2c,e) . The shape and localization of these astrocytes corresponded to B 18 or B1 19 cells, which serve as both stem and niche cells in the SVZ and play critical roles in adult neurogenesis. B cells bear GFAP and have a long basal process that terminates on blood vessels and an apical ending at the ventricle surface, with long cilia projecting into the ventricle, 18 which can be a target of infection via infected monocytes that have infiltrated the ventricle during the initial phase of infection. 16 It is not plausible for the infected GFAP-positive cells in the SVZ to have a direct effect on spongiogenesis, because the vacLesion is located a long way from the SVZ.Instead, these cells might have triggered a chain reaction of astrogliosis which spread from the SVZ reaching the deep white matter of the cerebellum (Fig. 2d,f) through the pathway of neurogenesis or the blood supply, given this area of gliosis ended abruptly at the edge of the granular layer (Fig. 2d,f) . It is presumed that B cell-originating migratory cells ascend in close contact with the basal lamina along with blood vessels in adulthood. 19 The cerebellar cortex receives its blood supply from the meninges that cover the cerebellum, in a different way from the cerebellar white matter. In addition, the granular layer is formed from granular neurons that have migrated from the external granular layer during embryonic and postnatal stages in mice. 33 Those astrocytes activated in a large area after being triggered by infection of the SVZ must have communicated with each other, leading to vacuole formation away from the infection sites. This cell-to-cell communication can be facilitated by direct contact between cells through an elongated cytoplasmic projection, as reported for the immunological synapse between leukocytes, especially between dendritic cells and lymphocytes. 34 Fine projections of astrocytes are detected in vacLesions, where, at a higher magnification, GFAP-positive foot processes were shown to be closely attached to the vacuolar walls (Fig. 2g) . Alternatively, signals can be spread by means of cytokine production, which is observed in all kinds of cell constituting the CNS (central nervous system), including astrocytes and neurons. 35 The contribution of microglia 36, 37 in this context should not be ignored, but the activation of microglia monitored by F4/80 or CD11b expression was not prominent at 48 h pi. 16 Furthermore, it has been reported that neurodegenerative progression can be protected by microglia and monocyte lineages 38 which produce neurotrophins. 39, 40 The finding that srr7 infection did not induce the prominent activation of microglia during the early phase of infection is markedly different from the spongiosis induced by infection with the neuropathogenic murine retroviral strain A8-V 8 . The A8-V-induced vacuoles showed close contact with either infected or non-infected microglia, with many activated microglia around the lesions. 6, 7 However, it takes a prolonged incubation period, 4-6 weeks after infection with A8-V, although a much shorter time compared with prion diseases, to observe neuropathologically apparent vacLesions. After such a long incubation period, there are several stages of neuropathological lesions and infectious agents either related or unrelated to the induction of spongiosis observed in the section can be scattered anywhere in the infected brain, leading to controversial findings concerning the correlation between distributions of infectious agents and lesions, typically reported in several prion diseases. 1 In srr7 infection, already at 72 h pi, the widespread distribution of viral antigens is observed, 25 which may disguise lesions produced by the indirect effects of infected cells.With the characteristic neuropathology of spongiosis where inflammatory cell infiltration was suppressed to the minimum level both in the initial phase ( Fig. 2a-g) and during the latter phase (Fig. 2h-n) like in other spongiotic lesions induced by different kinds of infectious agents, 1,7 srr7infection of mice would provide a superior experimental model to investigate the mechanism of how spongiotic lesions are formed, which remains unclear in spite of the long history of scientific research since infectious spongiotic encephalopathy was first reported 41 because of its extremely short incubation period compared with other experimental models of infectious spongiform degeneration in brains, minimizing many events inevitably induced after infection.  					1			
32332938	Oral hygiene risk factor	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7180644/		Oral hygiene risk factor  Sir, I would like to inform readers about the potential connection between high bacterial load in the mouth and complications associated with COVID-19 infection.Oral hygiene should be improved during a COVID-19 infection in order to reduce the bacterial load in the mouth and the risk of a bacterial superinfection. We recommend that poor oral hygiene be considered a risk to COVID-19 complications, particularly in patients predisposed to altered biofilms due to diabetes, hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Bacteria present in patients with severe COVID-19 are associated with the oral cavity, and improved oral hygiene may reduce the risk of complications. Whilst COVID-19 has a viral origin, it is suspected that in severe forms of the infection, bacteria plays a part, increasing the chance of complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death. 1 The development and severity of complications following a COVID-19 infection depend on numerous host and viral factors that will affect a patient's immune response. Whilst 80% of patients with COVID-19 infections have mild symptoms, 20% progress to have a severe form of infection associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers (Interleukin 2, 6, 10) and bacteria. 2,3 They also exhibit a remarkably higher neutrophil count and lower lymphocyte count than in mild patients. 4 A high neutrophil count is abnormal for a viral infection, but common for a bacterial infection, suggesting that in severe cases of COVID-19, bacterial superinfection is common.The three main comorbidities associated with an increased risk of complications from COVID-19 are diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. 5 These comorbidities are also associated with altered oral biofilms and periodontal disease. Periodontopathic bacteria are implicated in systemic inflammation, bacteraemia, and pneumonia.⁶ Bacteria present in the metagenome of patients severely infected with COVID-19 included high reads for Prevotella, Staphylococcus, and Fusobacterium, all usually commensal organisms of the mouth.⁷ Over 80% of patients in ICU exhibited an exceptionally high bacterial load,³ and treatment has been successful with a dual regime of an antiviral and an antibiotic.⁸ It is clear that bacterial superinfections are common in patients suffering from a severe case of COVID-19.V.

25680079	Nonlytic spread of naked viruses	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.4161/15548627.2014.994372?needAccess=true	How do viruses spread from cell to cell? Enveloped viruses acquire their surrounding membranes by budding: either through the plasma membrane or an internal membrane of infected cells. Thus, a newly budded enveloped virus finds itself either in the extracellular milieu or in a lumenal compartment from which it can exit the cell by conventional secretion. On the other hand, naked viruses such as poliovirus, nodavirus, adenovirus, and SV40 lack an external membrane. They are simply protein-nucleic acid complexes within the cytoplasm or nucleus of the infected cell, and thus would seem to have no other exit route than cell lysis. We have presented the first documentation of nonlytic spread of a naked virus, and showed the interconnections between this event and the process or components of the autophagy pathway.			1			1			
26209116	Innate and adaptive immunity against Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112826/	Abstract Many highly effective vaccines have been produced against viruses whose virulent infection elicits strong and durable protective immunity. In these cases, characterization of immune effector mechanisms and identification of protective epitopes/immunogens has been informative for the development of successful vaccine programs. Diseases in which the immune system does not rapidly clear the acute infection and/or convalescent immunity does not provide highly effective protection against secondary challenge pose a major hurdle for clinicians and scientists. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) falls primarily into this category, though not entirely. PRRSV causes a prolonged infection, though the host eventually clears the virus. Neutralizing antibodies can provide passive protection when present prior to challenge, though infection can be controlled in the absence of detectable neutralizing antibodies. In addition, primed pigs (through natural exposure or vaccination with a modified-live vaccine) show some protection against secondary challenge. While peripheral PRRSV-specific T cell responses have been examined, their direct contribution to antibody-mediated immunity and viral clearance have not been fully elucidated. The innate immune response following PRRSV infection, particularly the antiviral type I interferon response, is meager, but when provided exogenously, IFN-α enhances PRRSV immunity and viral control. Overall, the quality of immunity induced by natural PRRSV infection is not ideal for informing vaccine development programs. The epitopes necessary for protection may be identified through natural exposure or modified-live vaccines and subsequently applied to vaccine delivery platforms to accelerate induction of protective immunity following vaccination. Collectively, further work to identify protective B and T cell epitopes and mechanisms by which PRRSV eludes innate immunity will enhance our ability to develop more effective methods to control and eliminate PRRS disease.						1		1	
7941308	Humoral immune response to Salmonella abortusovis in sheep: in vitro induction of an antibody synthesis from either sensitized or unprimed lymph node cells	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119719/	Abstract In vitro culture conditions were determined to induce an anti-Salmonella abortusovis antibody synthesis from lymph node leucocytes of three immunized sheep and two unprimed lambs maintained in culture in the presence of heat-inactivated bacteria for 2 weeks. Humoral immune responses were assessed by enumerating specific antibody-secreting cells using ELISASPOT and by titrating immunoglobulins secreted into culture supernatants using ELISA techniques. Optimal secondary antibody response was observed from cultures performed with fetal calf serum (compared with horse serum) and with an antigen concentration of one to ten bacteria per cell. This kind of antigenic stimulation allowed induction of numerous antibody-secreting cells without adsorption of the secreted antibodies. Maximal numbers of antibody-secreting cells could reach a rate of 1% of the sheep leucocytes initially put into culture. Kinetic profiles of antibody production from boosted lymph node cells were characterized by an ascending phase from the sixth to the twelfth day of culture and then showed a plateau phase until Day 14. Most of the responses were composed of IgM and IgG1 antibodies, traces of IgG2 being detected at the end of experiments. From the twelfth day of antigenic stimulation, the IgM isotype was preferentially expressed with high antigen concentration (100 bacteria per cell), whereas the highest amounts of IgG1 were detected at lower concentration (one to ten bacteria per cell). While anti-Salmonella IgM appeared to be mainly specific for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) cell wall fraction, some IgG1 recognized other bacterial antigens. Kinetic profiles and magnitudes of primary antibody responses induced in vitro from lamb lymph node cells did not differ from those defined in cultures of sheep boosted leucocytes. But these immune reactions were mainly made up of anti-LPS IgM. Few anti-Salmonella IgG1 were detected from the tenth day of culture. So these in vitro assays allowed induction of an antibody synthesis from either in vivo sensitized or unprimed sheep lymph node leucocytes. This methodology would permit achievement of more detailed studies on interactions between Salmonella and lymph node leucocytes, leading to a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling bacterial dissemination through the lymphoid tissue.	Introduction  Facultative intracellular bacteria, such as Salmonella, Brucella or Listeria, are considered to be major pathogenic agents for all domestic animal species and could be transmitted to humans. The pathogenesis of these infections involves a step of bacterial dissemination from the inoculation site to the liver and spleen through the draining lymph nodes. Bacterial colonization of lymph node draining the inoculation area has been described after experimental infections by the conjunctival Plommet, 1975, 1976) and the subcutaneous routes (Pardon, 1977; Pardon and Marly, 1979; Lantier, 1987 ) , but mechanisms restricting the bacterial dissemination are poorly understood.Mechanisms of host defense involve both cellular and humoral immune reactions. Immune responses induced within lymph nodes seem to play a fundamental role in control of the infectious process. T-lymphocyte responses appear late, from nearly the tenth day following infection (Maskell et al., 1987 ) , and are responsible for granuloma formation (Guilloteau et al., 1991 ) . However, in cell-transfer experiments studying protective mechanisms, it has been shown that T-cells from lymph nodes were more efficient than spleen cells in the transfer of anti-Brucella immunity to mice (Plommet and Plommet, 1987 ) . Antibody production from B-cells occurs earlier in infection and is usually considered as the first evidence of the bacterial contamination. With their agglutinin and opsonin properties, specific antibodies secreted within lymphoid tissue would be involved in control of the bacterial colonization of lymph nodes, as has been previously described (Pardon, 1977; Plommet and Plommet, 1989) .With a suitable size for the development of surgical procedures (Miyasaka and Trnka, 1985; Hopkins et al., 1985; Lascelles et al., 1988) , sheep represent the best model for studying the role of lymph nodes in restricting bacterial dissemination from the inoculation site. The establishment of an experimental model of infection by Salmonella abortusovis, a serotype specific for sheep which induces abortion and sometimes mortality of newborn lambs (Pardon et al., 1990b) , gives the opportunity to study the Salmonella pathogenesis pattern in its natural host. In mice, experimental inoculation of S. abortusovis results in an infection similar to the one developed after Salmonella typhimurium administration (Pardon and Marly, 1979; Lantier et al., 1981 ) .The intensity of bacterial dissemination through lymph nodes can vary according to the bacterial strain virulence (Fontaine et al., 1994) and according to the expression of the host genetic resistance (Plant and Glynn, 1976; Hormaeche, 1979a,b; O'Brien, 1986; Hormaeche and Maskell, 1989; Oswald et al., 1992 ) . Previous work has shown that after intravenous or subcutaneous inoculation of sheep with the vaccinal Rv6 strain of S. abortusovis (Lantier et al., 1983; Pardon et al., 1990a) , blood levels of the specific humoral immune response determined by ELISA tests were closely related to the animal susceptibility to the disease, measured by the bacterial infection level in spleen, liver and lymph nodes. Greater bacterial numbers were detected from infected organs, and higher anti-S, abortusovis antibody titres were measured in blood (A.V. Gautier and F. Lantier, unpublished data, 1990) .To better understand the mechanisms controlling bacterial dissemination through lymph nodes and to study in detail interactions between Salmonella and host phagocytic cells Heffron, 1989, 1991; Finlay and Falkow, 1989) which play an antigen-presenting cell (APC) function towards lymph node lymphocytes, an in vitro assay allowing the induction of an antibody synthesis from both in vivo sensitized and unprimed sheep leucocytes had to be set up.This report describes an in vitro assay performed with sheep lymph node cells, maintained in culture with S. abortusovis bacteria. The in vitro antibody synthesis induced after the antigenic stimulation was revealed, either by enumerating anti-S, abortusovis antibody-secreting cells using ELISASPOT assays, or by titration of antigen-specific antibodies secreted into culture supernatants using ELISA assays. The comparison between ELISASPOT and ELISA data allows study at the cellular level and leads to a more detailed approach of the ovine humoral immune response.  Experimental design  The in vitro secondary antibody response has been assessed from three different culture experiments, carried out with in vivo primed lymph node cells from three sheep, respectively, of the Prralpes du Sud flock of the Laboratory of Infectious Pathology and Immunology. Those 10-to 19-month-old animals were immunized intravenously with 108 bacteria of the live attenuated vaccinal Rv6 strain of S. abortusovis (Lantier et al., 1981; Pardon et al., 1990b) and then killed 1 month later. Unprimed lymph node cells from two 4-monthold lie-de-France lambs were used to study the in vitro-induced primary humoral immune response. For each slaughtered sheep, cell cultures were performed from the prescapular, mediastinal, precrural, iliac and hepatic lymph nodes. Reported results represent mean values of the individual data and the standard errors (mean ___ SEM ).  Bacteria and preparation of microbial suspensions  Bacterial suspensions of the vaccinal S. abortusovis Rv6 strain (Lantier et al., 1981; Pardon et al., 1990b) , either inoculated into sheep or a source of antigen for the in vitro lymph node cell cultures and the immunoenzymatic assays (ELISA and ELISASPOT tests), were prepared as previously described (Pardon and Marly, 1979; Lantier et al., 1981 ) . Briefly, stored at -70 ° C in spleens of inoculated mice, bacteria were then grown on tryptic soy agar (Bio-M6rieux) slopes for 18 h at 37°C and harvested in phosphate buffered saline (saline, pH 6.85 ). These bacterial suspensions were standardized turbidimetrically. Purity of cultures and numbers of viable organisms were checked by plating serial dilutions.Used as antigenic preparations in sheep leucocyte cultures, the bacterial suspensions were heat killed by treatment at 60°C for 2 h (Lantier et al., 1983 ) and then stored at -70°C. Before use, inactivated bacteria were washed twice in saline at 5000 X g, 4 °C for 20 min. Appropriate dilutions were performed in culture medium (see below).For the coating step of ELISA and ELISASPOT microtiter plates, bacterial suspensions were first killed by heating at 60 °C for 2 h, then incubated overnight at 4°C with 1% phenol in saline and washed twice at 2500Xg, 4°C for 30 min in 0.5% phenol-saline. This stock suspension was standardized turbidimetrically, adjusted to the concentration of 3.8X l09 bacteria ml-~ by appropriate dilution in 0.5% phenol-saline and then stored at 4 °C (adapted from Williams and Whittemore, 1973 ) .  Lymph node cell preparation  Lymph node cell suspensions were prepared according to a technique previously set up for the isolation of sheep peripheral blood mononuclear cells. First, lymph nodes were washed in MEM (Gibco, 041-01380 ) supplemented with 2.5% heat-inactivated normal lamb serum (NLS), 200 U ml-1 of penicillin (Sigma, P-3032) and 0.2 mg ml-~ of streptomycin (Sigma, S-9137 ) (2.5% NLS-MEM).Cells were released from organs by cutting the lymphoid tissues into small pieces with scissors in 2.5% NLS-MEM. Cellular suspensions were then filtered on gauze to remove cell debris and layered on Ficoll gradient (Histopaque 1077, Sigma, 1077-1 ). After a 1600Xg centrifugation for 20 min at room temperature, lymph node leucocytes were collected at the Histopaque-MEM interface and washed three times with 2.5% NLS-MEM at 400 × g, 4 ° C for 15 rain. Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue dye exclusion test and the cell suspensions were adjusted to a final concentration of 1.25 X 107 viable leucocytes per ml of culture medium. The culture medium used was RPMI-1640 (Gibco, 041-01870) supplemented with either 10% heat-inacti-vated fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco, 011-06290 M) or 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (HS, Gibco, 034-06050 H), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco, 043-05030 H), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, 043-01360 H), 5X 10 -5 M 2mercaptoethanol (Serva, A 28625 ) and antibiotics ( 10% FCS-RPMI or 10% HS-RPMI).  Lymph node cell cultures and in vitro antigenic boost  Lymph node cell cultures, involving an in vitro antigenic stimulation, were carried out according to a technique previously set up (Berthon et al., 1990 ) and using different concentrations of either heat-inactivated S. abortusovis Rv6 or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Salmonella abortusequi (phenol extract, Sigma, L-5886) dissolved in culture medium. This LPS presents O-antigen specificities identical to LPS from S. abortusovis (Le Minor, 1984) .Antigenic boost in vitro was achieved by mixing, in each well of tissue culture 24-well plates (Linbro, Flow Laboratories, 76-033-05 ), 0.4 ml of lymph node cell suspension ( 5 × 106 cells per well) with 0.1 ml of either heat-killed bacterial suspensions (5 X 106, 5 × 107 and 5 × 108 bacteria per well, i.e. one, ten and 100 bacteria per lymph node cell) or LPS dilutions corresponding to final concentrations of 0.01, 0.1 and 1 #g ml-1 (final volume of 0.5 ml per well). In both cases, cell cultures were performed using medium supplemented with 10% serum from fetal calf or adult horse. In control cultures, the addition of antigen was replaced with 0.1 ml of culture medium. Cultures were performed for 2 weeks and every 2 days supernatant samples were taken from each well (0.1 ml for the first sample and 0.4 ml for the others) and fresh culture medium (0.5 ml per well) was added. At the same time, lymph node cells from at least two wells were harvested and cell survival was assessed by enumerating viable leucocytes from samples using the trypan blue dye exclusion test. Results were expressed, according to the duration of culture, as percentages of the living lymph node cells initially put into culture.  ELISASPOT test for enumerating antibody-secreting cells  ELISASPOT tests were performed using microtiter plates with 96 flat-bottomed wells (Nunc, Immunoplates, 4-42404) coated with inactivated S. abortusovis bacteria. The enumeration of antibody-secreting cells by ELISAS-POT test makes it necessary to perform an homogeneous and regular coating of antigen into microtiter plates; hence, the technique set up for coating bacteria on ELISASPOT plates was slightly different from the one used for ELISA plates (see below) and from the technique previously described with Salmonella typhi (Kantele, 1990) .Microtiter plates were first pre-treated with 0.1 ml per well of a 0.2% glutaraldehyde aqueous solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C (Logtenberg et al., 1985 ) . After a wash with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.5 ), plates were filled with 0.1 ml per well of the stock bacterial suspension diluted 1 : 10 in saline (3.8 X 107 bacteria per well) and incubated overnight at 4 o C. Then, plates were twice washed carefully with PBS and the protein adhesiveness of the wells was blocked with 5% bovine skimmed milk in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, followed by a wash with PBS.ELISASPOT tests were carried out with sheep lymph node cells primed in vivo and boosted in vitro. After every 2 days of culture, cell samples were prepared as described elsewhere (Berthon et al., 1990) . Briefly, lymph node cells from several wells were harvested and washed in 5% FCS-MEM to remove free antibodies. Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue dye exclusion test and several dilutions from each cell sample were prepared in 10% FCS-RPMI and put into microtiter plates. Negative controls were performed on plates coated with the B 19 strain of Brucella abortus, which is a Gramnegative bacterium showing no antigenic cross-reactivity with S. abortusovis (Diaz and Bosseray, 1974) , inactivated by heat and formol (gift from Dr. G. Dubray, INRA, Laboratory of Infectious Pathology and Immunology, Nouz-iUy, France). Cells were incubated at 37°C for 3 h and then removed. Antibodies secreted locally by B-lymphocytes were revealed as spots using an immunoenzymatic technique involving alkaline phosphatase conjugate Holt, 1983, 1986; Bianchi et al., 1990) . In the present assay, a first overnight incubation at 4 °C was performed using rabbit antibodies to sheep immunoglobulins (Ig) (Dako, Z 138 ), diluted 1:7500 in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Merck, 822 184) and 20% skimmed milk (Tweenmilk-PBS). A second incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 2 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated swine Ig to rabbit Ig (Dako, D 306) diluted 1:650 in Tween-milk-PBS. The enzymatic activity was revealed using as substrate 5-bromo 4-chloro 3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma, B-8503) in agarose (Sigma, A-6013) Holt, 1983, 1986) , at the rate of 0.05 ml per well, incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark, enabling well-contrasted blue spots to be obtained. Alkaline phosphatase activity was stopped by adding 0.05 ml per well of 3 N sodium hydroxide solution and plates were stored at 4 °C until reading. The numbers of spots per well were counted using an Olympus CK2 inverted microscope (40-and 100-fold magnification).Since assays were performed on pools of several wells, they represented averages of several lymph node cell cultures. As shown by the results obtained from the different dilutions of samples, the numbers of spots were directly proportional to leucocyte concentration. Taking the cell culture recoveries into account, the results were expressed, according to the culture duration, as the decimal logarithm of the spot-forming cell (SFC) numbers per 106 lymph node cells initially put into culture.  ELISA tests for measuring secreted antibody  Anti-S. abortusovis antibodies secreted into lymph node cell culture supernatants were detected according to different ELISA techniques. Amounts of the whole of specific antibodies were determined on microtiter plates coated with bacteria while Ig-isotype of in vitro produced antibodies were studied on both bacteria-and LPS-coated plates.ELISA tests on bacteria were performed using 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner, Labortechnik, No. 655 161 ), filled with 0.05 ml per well ( 1.9 × 107 bacteria per well) of a 1 : 10 dilution in saline of the stock suspension of inactivated S. abortusovis, also used for ELISASPOT tests. Plates were left to dry overnight at 37 ° C. After two washes with tap water and a wash with PBS, bacterial antigens were fixed for 20 min at -20°C with 0.2 ml per well of a cold 80% (v/v) acetone-water solution and then, washed as before. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating plates with 0.1 ml per well of 5% bovine skimmed milk in PBS for 15 min at room temperature.When the LPS fraction was used as immobilized antigen, 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Immunoplates, 4-42404) were coated with 0.05 ml per well of a 1 mg ml -~ stock solution of LPS prepared in a 50% (v/v) PBS-glycerol mixture and diluted 1 : 100 in 0.05 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) (0.5/zg per well). After an overnight incubation at 4°C, plates were washed twice with tap water, once with PBS and then incubated with bovine milk as described previously.In both cases, following two washes with PBS, culture supernatant samples with unknown antibodies were added (0.1 ml per well ) after serial 1 : 3 dilutions in Tween-milk-PBS and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Positive controls were performed with a specific anti-S, abortusovis serum from a hyperimmunized sheep used as reference sample in each test. Negative controls were carried out with 0.1 ml per well of fresh lymph node cell culture medium.Amounts of the whole of secreted anti-Salmonella antibodies were revealed using peroxidase-conjugated rabbit Ig to sheep IgG (H and L chains) (Nordic), 1:3000 diluted in Tween-milk-PBS and incubated for 90 min at 37 o C. Ig-isotype was studied on bacteria-and LPS-coated plates using appropriate dilutions of mouse monoclonal antibodies to sheep IgG1, IgG2 (Beh, 1987 ) and sheep IgM (Beh, 1988 ) (ascitic fluids kindly provided by Dr. K.J. Beh, CSIRO, Division of Animal Health, McMaster Laboratory, Glebe, Australia). After a 90 min incubation at 37 ° C, monoclonal antibody binding was detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat Ig to mouse IgG (H and L chains) (Bio-Rad, No. 172-1011 ), 1 : 10 000 diluted in Tween-milk-PBS and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. Between each of the steps, plates were washed four times with tap water and three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in saline. The peroxidase activity was detected with 2,2'-azino-bis-( 3-ethyl benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Boehringer Mannheim)/H202 substrate solution and read at 415 nm (Bernard et al., 1986 ) . Optical densities were obtained according to the serial 1 : 3 dilutions of samples allowed to obtain ELISA logistic curves. These curves underwent conversion to logits to get linear functions enabling the determination of the sample dilution for the point of inflexion of the ELISA logistic curves.Results were expressed as antibody titres. Antibody titres were equivalent to the logarithm base 3 (log3) of the sample dilution for which the point of inflexion of the corresponding ELISA logistic curve was reached.  Cell culture recovery  With regard to the in vitro induction of a secondary antibody response from in vivo primed lymph node cells, boosted in vitro with either heat-inactivated S. abortusovis or LPS from S. abortusequi, cell recoveries decreased throughout the experiments (Table 1 ). From about 60% on Day 2 of culture, values fell to nearly 40% on Day 4 and to 35% on Day 6 until Day 10. Afterwards, lower survival rates (20%) could be observed from some samples, especially from those maintained with HS and stimulated with LPS. Despite antigenic boost in vitro, cell recovery from stimulated samples did not seem to significantly differ from control values. The greatest survival rates (45-50%) were obtained when cells were cultured in the presence of the highest concentration Table 1 Characteristics of the antibody responses induced from in vivo sensitized lymph node cells, boosted in vitro with either heat-inactivated S. abortusovis (SAO) (one, ten and 100 bacteria per cell) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0.01, 0.1 and 1/tg ml-~ ). Cell cultures were carried out in the presence of fetal calf serum or horse serum. For each sample, reported data include the maximum of the antibody response (expressed as the logm of the maximal number of spot-forming cells (SCF) per 106 cells initially put into culture; mean_+ SEM, n = 3 ), the day of culture corresponding to this peak of the immune response and the cell culture recovery observed on this day (expressed as the percentage of living cells initially put into culture; mean + SEM, n = 3 )  Culture  Fetal calf serum Horse serum of inactivated S. abortusovis ( 100 bacteria per cell), during the second week of culture. The stimulation in vitro with LPS (from 0.01 to 1/tg ml-' ) showed no mitogenic effect of this fraction on the cultured lymph node cells. Concentration of LPS higher than 1/tg ml-1 was cytotoxic, whereas a concentration of 0.001/zg ml-1 gave similar results to those reported (data not shown).A similar range of cell recoveries was observed during the induction of the primary antibody response, from unprimed lymph node cell cultures in vitro stimulated with 100 S. abortusovis per leucocyte in the presence of FCS ( Table 2 ) .  Enumeration of antibody-secreting cells from boosted cell cultures  From lymph node cells of immunized sheep, re-stimulated in vitro with either inactivated Salmonella (Figs. 1 (a) and 1 (b)) or LPS (Table 1 ) , cells secreting specific antibody to S. abortusovis were enumerated at 2-day intervals using an ELISASPOT technique.An humoral immune response mainly appeared when lymph node cells underwent an antigenic boost in vitro with whole bacteria, compared with the LPS stimulation (Table 1 ) . Whatever the LPS concentration, this antigen led to an early and weak response, characterized by a peak on the fourth day of culture and a magnitude lower than ten SFC per 106 leucocytes. No more SFC were detected by Day 8 (data not shown ).The profile and magnitude of the kinetics of the SFC numbers, induced after the boost with inactivated bacteria, were almost similar according to the antigen concentration (Figs. 1 (a) and 1 (b) ). The lowest in vitro antigenic stimulation (one bacterium per cell) led to the earliest induction of antibody synthesis, detected as soon as the fourth day of culture. Maximal SFC num- (1994) (Table 1 ) .  Cultures were performed with either fetal calf serum (FCS: a,c) or horse serum (HS: b,d); a,b: enumeration of specific spot-forming cells (SFC) by ELISASPOT on fixed bacteria. Results were expressed as lOgl0 of SFC numbers per 10 6 cells initially put into culture (mean_+ SEM, n = 3 ). c,d: titration of antibodies secreted into culture supernatants by ELISA on whole bacteria. Antibody titres represented log 3 of the sample dilution corresponding to the inflexion point of the ELISA logistic curve (mean + SEM, n = 3 ). bers were observed from Day 10 and could represent nearly 1% of cells initially put into culture (or 3-4% of living cells tested from samples). No significant difference was observed in results, according to the kind of serum used as culture medium supplement  In both cases, a few or no SFC were detected from control samples, in which in vivo primed cells have been cultured without antigenic stimulation. Resuits obtained at the same time, using B. abortus B 19 as coated antigen for the ELISASPOT assay, showed that all these SFC were secreting specific anti-S.  Assessment of the antibody secretion in vitro during the secondary immune response  Parallel to the ELISASPOT technique which allowed the enumeration of specific antibody-secreting cells from lymph node cell cultures, ELISA assays were carried out to determine amounts of anti-S, abortusovis antibodies secreted into culture supernatants (Figs. 1 (c) and 1 (d) ).Magnitudes of the antibody responses, measured by ELISA technique on the fourteenth day of antigenic stimulation, were higher from cell cultures performed with FCS than those observed from cultures with HS, whereas the kinetics of the SFC numbers did not differ with the kind of serum used (Figs.  1 (a) and 1 (b) ).Kinetic profiles induced in FCS increased throughout the culture duration while those characterizing responses in HS increased until Day 12 and then reached a plateau phase. After the LPS boost in vitro, no antibody was detected from samples maintained in HS (data not shown). A very weak immune response appeared from FCS cultures, with a peak on Day 6 (maximal antibody titre, obtained with the 0.1/zg ml-~ LPS concentration, was equal to 0.48_+0.11 ), and no more antibody was revealed by Day 10 (data not shown). No antibody was detected from unstimulated lymph node cell culture supernatants.Results on the amounts of secreted antibodies, when cells were re-stimulated with inactivated bacteria, showed an effect of the antigen concentration on the kinetics of the antibody response (Figs. 1 (c) and (d) ). The earliest immune reactions and the highest antibody titres were observed from samples stimulated with the lowest bacterial concentration. Maximal titres reached on Day 14 were, according to increasing antigen concentrations (one, ten and 100 bacteria per cell), 5.45+2.21, 6.19+3.40 and 3.47+0.87 in FCS and 3.93_+0.50, 2.96_+0.35 and 2.81 +0.19 in HS, respectively.Whatever the serum used, according to the increasing amounts of bacteria per cell, secreted antibody could be detected from Day 6, Day 8 and Day 10, respectively, while under identical conditions the SFC could be revealed from Day 4 in the presence of one bacterium per cell and from the sixth day of culture both in the presence of ten and 100 bacteria per cell. Hence, at low bacterial concentration (one and ten S. abortusovis per leucocyte), a 2 day lag was observed between the appearance of the SFC and the detection of antibodies secreted into culture supernatants. With a higher antigen concentration of 100 bacteria per cell, this interval increased and the lag reached 4 days. This suggests that large amount of bacteria could adsorb antibody and then induce a decrease of the antibody titres determined by ELISA. These results show that optimal in vitro culture conditions involved the use of FCS instead of HS and an antigen concentration of the order of one to ten bacteria per cell.  Ig-isotype and antigen specificity of secreted antibody after the boost in vitro  Ig-isotypes expressed by the anti-S, abortusovis antibodies secreted into supernatants of in vivo primed lymph node cell cultures were studied by an Fig. 2 IgM titres were obtained with ten and 100 bacteria per cell, whereas maximal IgG 1 antibody synthesis was detected in the presence of one and ten bacteria per cell. When humoral responses were studied on their specificity against LPS, their kinetic profiles were identical to those determined on inactivated whole bacteria. Titres of anti-LPS IgM were always higher than those measured on S. abortusovis. The anti-LPS IgG 1 synthesis was detected later than the anti-S. abortusovis IgG1 production, with a 2 day lag, and showed a lower magnitude. The weak and late anti-S, abortusovis IgG2 response also contained some anti-LPS IgG2, detected on Day 14 of the culture, only from samples stimulated with one bacterium per cell (data not shown).  ELISA technique performed on two kinds of fixed antigens: inactivated S. abortusovis whole bacteria and the polyosidic LPS fraction. Only data involving lymph node cell cultures carried out in the presence of FCS and boosted with heat-inactivated bacteria are presented in  From lymph node cell cultures with FCS, a very small and early anti-S. abortusovis humoral response was induced with a LPS stimulation. These immune reactions were composed of IgM and IgG 1 antibody (data not shown). Kinetics of IgM titres were identical to those described for the whole of anti-S. abortusovis antibodies, with a peak on Day 6 and no more antibody from Day I 0. As previously, anti-LPS IgM titres were higher than the IgM titres against whole Salmonella. Traces of IgG 1 were detected only on Day 8 of the culture and only by ELISA performed on fixed whole bacteria.In vitro antibody synthesis during the primary immune response Figure 3 reports ELISA data obtained from in vivo unprimed lymph node cells of two lambs, which were maintained in vitro without or with an antigen concentration of 100 heat-inactivated bacteria per leucocyte for 2 weeks in the presence of FCS. Similar results were observed from cell cultures performed with HS (data not shown ).Results revealed that this kind of humoral response was mainly composed of IgM antibodies which appeared from the eighth day of culture. Defined either on whole bacteria or on LPS, the kinetic profiles of those IgM responses were characterized by a peak on Day 12. As previously observed during the secondary antibody response, anti-LPS IgM titres were always higher than titres of the anti-S, abortusovis IgM. Some anti-S, abortusovis IgG1 antibodies were detected on whole bacteria-coated plates during the second week of the culture experiments, from the tenth day. No IgG2 was revealed according to either kind of ELISA technique used and no antibody synthesis was shown from supernatants of leucocyte cultures performed without antigenic stimulation.  Discussion  This study describes a new assay for an in vitro antibody synthesis, specific to bacterial antigens, from lymph node cells of unprimed lambs and sheep immunized by the intravenous route to get a general antigenic sensitization of the lymph nodes and killed 1 month later when no more bacteria were present within lymphoid tissues (Pardon et al., 1990a) .Culture conditions were derived from those previously established with pig leucocytes, stimulated in vitro with viral antigens (Berthon et al., 1990) . From the sera available in the author's laboratory and checked by ELISA, only sera from fetal calf and adult horse were found devoid of antibody cross-reacting with bacteria (data not shown). Hence, FCS, considered to be Ig-free, and HS, with supposed low mitogenic properties, have been chosen to carry out sheep leucocyte cultures.From cultures of either in vivo sensitized or unprimed sheep lymph node cells, according to the serum used as culture medium supplement, no great difference appeared concerning cell culture recoveries. Differences were rather induced with the kind of antigen stimulation performed in vitro. The highest cell recoveries were observed with the concentration of inactivated Salmonella of 100 bacteria per cell. Higher amounts of inactivated S. abortusovis per well have been tested ( 160 bacteria per cell), corresponding to the antigen concentration of the stock suspension of Salmonella. These conditions led to similar results to those obtained with the former bacterial concentration (data not shown). Culture conditions defined in this report differ from those previously described for pig blood lymphocytes stimulated with bacterial antigens such as membrane components of Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae (Borthwick et al., 1988 ) . In that case, the boost in vitro had to be carried out in the form of an antigenic pulse for 16 h to keep the cells clear of the cytotoxic effect of such antigens. Results on cell culture recoveries from sheep lymph node leucocytes stimulated with inactivated S. abortusovis, showed that these cells could be maintained in the presence of whole bacteria throughout the experiments. Some samples were cultured for 1 month (data not shown).Within the concentrations tested, inactivated Salmonella appeared to exert no cytotoxic effect over sheep leucocytes.In vitro antigenic boost of in vivo primed leucocytes was also performed using LPS to study the effect of this component of the cell wall of Gramnegative bacteria on the immune response from sheep lymphocytes stimulated in vivo with living whole bacteria. The LPS used in these experiments, at higher amounts than 1/~g m1-1, was cytotoxic for sheep leucocytes (data not shown ). In the range of 0.001 to 1/tg ml-~, no mitogenic effect was demonstrated throughout the culture duration. From in vivo primed lymph node cells, in vitro LPS boost induced a very weak and short immune antibody response, suggesting a lack of a polyclonal activation of the Salmonella-specific B-cells.In vitro antigenic boost with inactivated whole bacteria of in vivo primed sheep lymph node cells led to the expression of a well-developed immune antibody response, detected either by ELISASPOT or by ELISA tests. This secondary humoral immune response was S. abortusovis specific and very low background was revealed from control cultures, whatever the serum used. Although identical numbers of SFC (measured by ELISASPOT) were induced from samples, antibody titres (determined by ELISA) were higher in the presence of FCS than those observed with HS. This would suggest that, according to the in vitro culture conditions, lymph node cells boosted in the presence of FCS were able to secrete, at the cellular level, more antibodies than the same cells maintained in HS. The antibody production in vitro was detected only if leucocytes, even after an in vivo immunization, were re-stimulated with bacteria. No spontaneous antibody secretion was shown from in vivo primed lymph node cells put into culture without antigen.In the presence of an antigen concentration of one and ten bacteria per cell, SFC were first detected from the fourth and the sixth day of culture, respectively, while the corresponding antibody secretions into culture supernatants could be measured from Day 6 and Day 8. This 2 day lag between the enumeration of antibody-secreting cells and the titration of synthesized antibody has already been observed (Berthon et al., 1990) . When leucocytes were re-e. Berthon et al. / Veterinary lrnmunology and lmmunopathology 41 (1994) [275] [276] [277] [278] [279] [280] [281] [282] [283] [284] [285] [286] [287] [288] [289] [290] [291] [292] [293] [294] stimulated in vitro with higher bacterial concentrations ( 100 bacteria per cell), the SFC numbers slightly increased but the lag between ELISASPOT and ELISA results reached 4 days, suggesting that some antibodies secreted into culture supernatants were adsorbed by the antigen. So data from both techniques of antibody detection appeared to be less closely related. For this reason, an antigen concentration from one to ten bacteria per cell, allowing a good expression of SFC without great antibody adsorption, has been chosen for further experiments.Kinetic profiles of the SFC numbers from in vivo primed cells, boosted in vitro, showed an ascending stage from Day 4 until about Day 10 and then reached a plateau phase to Day 14. Kinetic profiles of the SFC numbers previously determined from lymphocytes directly isolated from humans immunized with S. typhi vaccine (Kantele, 1990; or from sheep vaccinated with a mutant strain of S. typhimurium (Lascelles et al., 1988) , without an in vitro boost step, were characterized by a narrow peak on Days 5 or 7 after immunization. So, the antigenic re-stimulation step, performed in vitro with inactivated bacteria, seems to further a long-lasting humoral immune response. This might be dependent upon the nature of the antigen used and, especially on the presence of LPS into the cell wall of bacteria (Ruttkowski and Nixdorff, 1980) . These secondary antibody responses to S. abortusovis, from sheep lymph node cell cultures, were mainly composed of IgM and IgG 1 antibodies. Similar Ig-isotypes were preferentially expressed in vivo, after experimental infection of sheep with Salmonella (Lascelles et al., 1988) . In comparison with the IgG1 antibody secretion, the weak and late IgG2 response could be related to the differences in the respective biological activities of ovine IgG 1 and IgG2 (Levieux, 1990 ) .During the second week of cell cultures, the highest IgM antibody titres were observed in the presence of a high antigen concentration (ten to 100 bacteria per cell), while the greatest IgG titres appeared with a low concentration (one to ten bacteria per cell). This would suggest that either Ig-isotype expression could require different culture conditions or that some Ig-isotypes (in this case, IgG) could be preferentially adsorbed on antigen. These hypotheses could be confirmed using ELISASPOT tests performed according to the Ig-isotypes.If most of the anti-S, abortusovis IgM antibodies seemed to be LPS-specific, results concerning the IgG1 response showed that some anti-S, abortusovis IgG 1 were specific for other bacterial antigens. These data are in agreement with those previously described from mice and humans (Brown and Hormaeche, 1989) . This methodology has also been applied to study in vitro-induced primary immune responses from lamb lymph node cell cultures. Experiments were carried out using high antigen concentration ( 100 bacteria per cell) because those culture conditions led to slightly better cell culture recoveries and particularly allowed secretion of higher amounts of IgM antibody.Kinetic profiles characterizing the antibody production from unprimed lymph node cells were similar to those defined from in vivo sensitized leucocytes. The main difference between the two kinds of humoral immune responses stood at the level of the Ig-isotype expression. From unprimed lymph node leucocytes, most secreted antibodies were IgM, while from boosted cells, synthesized antibodies involved both IgM and IgG 1. The anti-Salmonella IgM appeared to be mainly composed of anti-LPS antibodies. The achievement of such primary antibody responses in vitro could be dependent upon the immunogenic properties of the Gram-negative bacteria used as antigen, but could also be related to the origin of cells put into culture. Thymus-dependent areas of lymph node contain interdigitating-dendritic cells considered to be the real effective APC, the only cells able to stimulate resting T-lymphocytes and to induce a primary immune response, in comparison with other kinds of APC such as macrophages or B-cells (Bujdoso et al., 1990) .This report describes for the first time the induction of an in vitro antibody synthesis specific for Salmonella, from either in vivo sensitized or unprimed lymph node cells. The assay, involving an in vitro antigenic stimulation of sheep leucocytes and an antibody detection using both ELISASPOT and ELISA tests, allows detailed studies on the ovine humoral immune response. Furthermore, characteristics of the immune reaction developed from in vivo primed leucocytes were identical to those observed in vivo. This suggests that these reported culture conditions might allow partial reproduction in vitro of some of the physiological mechanisms occurring in vivo. Such in vitro assays will give rise to more detailed studies on the interactions between Salmonella and lymph node APC and on the resulting immune responses, in relation to the expression of the host genetic resistance to the disease. This would lead to a better understanding of mechanisms controlling the bacterial dissemination through the lymphoid tissue.  					1			
24706959	Dramatic differences in the response of macrophages from B2 and B19 MHC-defined haplotypes to interferon gamma and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid stimulation	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107093/	Abstract The chicken MHC has been associated with disease resistance, though the mechanisms are not understood. The functions of macrophages, critical to both innate and acquired immunity, were compared between the more infectious bronchitis virus-resistant B2 and the more infectious bronchitis virus-susceptible B19 lines. In vivo peripheral blood concentrations of monocytes were similar in B2 or B19 homozygous haplotypes. Peripheral blood-derived macrophages were stimulated with poly I:C, simulating an RNA virus, or IFNγ, a cytokine at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity. Not only did B2-derived peripheral monocytes differentiate into macrophages more readily than the B19 monocytes, but as determined by NO production, macrophages from B2 and B2 on B19 genetic background chicks were also significantly more responsive to either stimulant. In conclusion, the correlation with resistance to illness following viral infection may be directly linked to a more vigorous innate immune response.	INTRODUCTION  Selective breeding of poultry has resulted in improved productivity in broilers at the cost of decreased immune competence and greater susceptibility to disease (Han and Smyth, 1972; Nestor et al., 1996; Bayyari et al., 1997) . On the other hand, some lines of birds have been shown to be more resistant to a variety of pathogens (Bearse et al., 1939; Hutt and Scholes, 1941) . Several studies have demonstrated an association between the chicken MHC-B haplotype and resistance to various pathogens including Marek's disease virus, avian leukosis virus, Newcastle disease virus, Rous sarcoma virus, and Salmonella (Heinzelmann et al., 1981; Briles et al., 1982; Lamont, 1989; Dunnington et al., 1992; Yoo and Sheldon, 1992; Mays et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2008; Banat et al., 2013) . Described in 1950 (Briles et al., 1950) , at least 51 B haplotypes of the chicken B complex have been identified using traditional serological techniques (Briles and Briles, 1987; Landesman et al., 1993; Sung et al., 1993; Miller et al., 2004) or gene sequencing, RFLP, single-strand conformational poly-morphism, and SNP (Juul-Madsen et al., 1993; Fulton et al., 2006; Juul-Madsen et al., 2006) .Retrospective studies have correlated susceptibility and resistance to avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)-induced clinical illness, with the B21 and B15 haplotype lines, respectively . More recently, infectivity studies identified B2, B5, and B8 chicken lines as being more resistant to IBV-induced illness than their B12 and B19 counterparts (Banat et al., 2013) . Given that the differences identified regarding disease resistance were observed early after infection, we propose that innate immunity plays a major role in B haplotype-associated disease resistance, with the macrophage being a key player.Monocytes/macrophages not only play a vital role within the innate immune system, but they are also important in the activation of specific adaptive immune responses acting as antigen-presenting cells. As such, these cells can affect the progression of clinical disease. Innate cellular activity depends solely on the expression of recognition molecules, such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) that bind the conserved pathogenassociated molecular patterns of common infectious organisms. The significance of the innate immune function of the macrophage in promoting disease resistance or susceptibility is not well understood. Macrophages are activated or primed upon encountering a pathogen or inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon (IFN) γ and subsequently undergo functional maturation, increasing expression of Fc-receptors on their cell surface (Dietert et al., 1991; Qureshi, 2003) . Macrophages of various chicken lines congenic for MHC have been shown to differ in their chemotactic activity (Qureshi et al., 1988) and recruitment and activation (Qureshi et al., 1986) . Like mammalian macrophages, avian macrophages produce nitric oxide (NO) upon activation, killing bacteria or protozoa and inhibiting viral replication (Boockvar et al., 1994; Kreil and Eibl, 1996; MacMicking et al., 1997) . Expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been shown to differ among chickens of several genotypes, as a result of enhanced transcriptional activity in iNOS hyper-responder genotypes Qureshi, 1997, 1998) .Another indicator for the importance of macrophages in disease susceptibility is the fact that White Leghorn (Cornell K-Strain) chicken bone marrow produces more macrophage colonies than those from broiler bone marrow cells, leading to the speculation that White Leghorn chickens may be more disease resistant. It has also been observed that broiler mortality losses are double the losses of layer-type chickens through the first 6 wk of age (Liljequist et al., 1993) . Taken together, these results suggest a genetic basis of macrophage activation playing an important role in the innate immune response and resistance to disease.Using an in vitro model, we investigated functional differences in the activation of differentiated chicken macrophages from chicks with distinct haplotypes. Type II IFNγ, a potent activator of macrophages, typically secreted by natural killer cells and other cells of the immune system upon encountering various pathogens, was used to stimulate cultured macrophages including B2/B2, B19/B19, and B2/B2 bred on the B19 genetic background (B19bg B2MHC ). In addition, in an effort to emulate viral infection, the TLR3 agonist and the synthetic analog of dsRNA, poly (I:C), were used to stimulate cultured macrophages. The results show differences in activation of macrophages measured by NO release among several B haplotypes.  Experimental Birds  Bird protocols were performed under the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, California. Fertilized eggs (from B2/B2, B15/B15, B21/B21, B19/B19, and B2/B2 MHC on B19 background (F3, B19bgB2) parents, descended from Modified Wisconsin Line 3) were obtained from W. Elwood Briles, Northern Illinois University, and incubated and hatched under standard conditions at (38°C, 50 to 65% humidity; Banat et al., 2013) at Western University of Health Sciences. Posthatch, chicks were maintained in the incubator for 24 h, then transferred to a preheated brooder (35°C). In addition to daily health monitoring, fresh food and water were provided ad libitum. At 3 wk of age, room temperature was adjusted to and maintained at 25°C. Chicks were housed in standard poultry cages. To minimize the risk of pecking disorders, chicks were kept under restricted lighting conditions throughout the study. Experimental birds were euthanized by insufflation of isoflurane gas (Butler, Dublin, OH).  Peripheral Blood Collection and Cell Counts  Whole blood samples were collected via jugular venipuncture in EDTA tubes from age-matched chicks 5 to 12 wk old. At no time did the amount of blood harvested from each bird exceed 3% of total blood volume [8% × BW in kilograms (BW kg )]. A 2-wk window was allowed between subsequent blood samplings. Samples were sent to Antech Diagnostics (Irvine, CA) for complete blood count and differentials.  Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Isolation  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from individual birds were isolated using the differential centrifugation as previously described (Seo and Collisson, 1997; Dawes et al., 2008; Drechsler et al., 2009 Drechsler et al., , 2013 . Briefly, 3 mL of blood was mixed with an equal volume of Alsever's solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) after which 3 mL of this mixture were layered over an equal volume of Ficoll-Hypaque (density 1.077 or 1.083; Sigma-Aldrich). Samples were centrifuged for 35 min (400 × g, 23°C; brake off) for retrieval of mononuclear cells. Isolated cells were washed twice in 5 mL of PBS (400 × g, 10 min, 23°C), counted, and viability confirmed based on the exclusion of 0.1% trypan blue dye (≥90%). The PBMC were resuspended in PBS to a final concentration of 5 × 10 7 cells/mL.  Macrophage Cell Culture  One milliliter of PBMC suspension (5 × 10 7 cells/ mL) was incubated (37°C/5% CO 2 ) for 3 h in each well of a 12-well plate containing RPMI w/o Phenol Red supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum; nonessential amino acids (0.1 mM/mL; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), l-glutamine (2 mM; Sigma-Aldrich), 2-mercaptoethanol (55 μM/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), penicillin (50 U/mL; Invitrogen), and streptomycin (50 μg/mL; Invitrogen). Following removal of nonadherent cells with warm PBS, medium was replenished and cells were incubated for 24 to 48 h to facilitate monocyte adherence and complete removal of thrombocytes, nonadherent lymphocytes and other semi-adherent cells. Prior to the replacement of medium, adherent cell cultures were washed in warm PBS. Monocytes were cultured for 6 d to allow maturation and differentiation of cells, with medium changes occurring every 3 to 4 d, thus ensuring that optimal nutrient requirements were met. The morphology of adherent cells was observed daily under bright field microscopy (20× objective).  Confirming Cell Purity Using an Immunofluorescence Assay  Purity of monocyte cultures, as well as 6-d-old primary macrophages, was confirmed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The monoclonal antibody, KUL01, has been used for flow cytometric identification of peripherally circulating chicken cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system throughout their ontogeny (monoblasts, promonocytes, monocytes, and tissue macrophages), whereas CV1-chNL68 and the monocyte monoclonal antibody K1 cross-react with chicken lymphocytes and thrombocytes, respectively (Mast et al., 1998) .Following the removal of medium, cells were fixed in a 1:1 (vol/vol) methanol:acetone mixture. Cells were rehydrated in PBS for 15 min before incubating with blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk/PBS) for 20 min. Staining with the mouse anti-chicken monocyte/macrophage antibody KUL01-FITC (Southern BioTech, Birmingham, AL; 1:250) was performed for 45 min to 1 h in the dark. Cells were then washed 3 times in PBS and viewed under a Nikon Eclipse Ti fluorescence microscope (10× objective, Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY).  Cell Counts and Flow Cytometry  To optimize procedures and establish macrophage counts after adherence, macrophages were counted in wells after adherence via the NIS Elements program (Nikon Instruments Inc.), with cells being counted per mm 2 and calculated per well, and flow cytometry was performed to compare yields from 1.077 versus 1.083 histopaque gradients.Briefly, mononuclear cells were washed twice in cold PBS and suspended in blocking buffer (1% NFDM, 0.1% sodium azide, and 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) for 20 min. After blocking, cells were washed and stained in the dark for 45 min with (1:250) FITClabeled mouse anti-chicken monocyte/macrophage antibody KUL01-FITC (Southern BioTech, Birmingham, AL), again washed in cold PBS 3 times, resuspended in 1 mL of cold PBS, and analyzed on Beckman Coulter cytomics FC 500 flow cytometer (10,000 events were obtained for each sample).  IF timulation  A 50 ρg/mL of ch-IFNγ solution (Invitrogen) was prepared in RPMI w/o Phenol Red culture medium (Invitrogen). After washing the cells twice with warm PBS, macrophage cultures were stimulated with 1 mL of RPMI-ch-IFNγ mixture.  ipofectamine Poly I C timulation  Lipofectamine-mediated transfection of poly (I:C) into cells was used as a model of RNA virus infection. Five microliters each of poly (I:C) (10 mg/mL) and lipofectamine solution (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) were incubated with 195 μL of OptiMEM medium (Invitrogen) for 5 min at room temperature. Both solutions were then combined and incubated at room temperature for 45 min before diluting the mixture 1:10 with OptimMEM to obtain a final concentration of 25 μg/mL of poly (I:C). Macrophages were incubated in 500 μL of the working solution for 5 to 6 h. Transfection was terminated by the addition of 500 μL of RPMI to each well.  NO Assays  Nitrite, a stable, reactive nitrogen intermediate, served as an indirect measure of NO production representing macrophage/monocyte stimulation (Crippen et al., 2003; Singh et al., 2010) . Briefly, cultured macrophages were centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min at room temperature to remove cell debris. One hundred microliters of each culture supernatant were incubated in the dark with an equal volume (1:1) of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide/0.1 naphthylenediamine/2.5% phosphoric acid) in individual wells of a 96-well plate for 15 min. Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 590 nM using an ELISA plate reader (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ). Values were compared with concentrations derived from a standard curve prepared by serial dilution (in RPMI w/o Phenol Red) of a 2 mM sodium nitrite stock solution (Sigma-Aldrich). Assays were performed in triplicate at designated times.  tatistics  Nitric oxide concentrations were expressed as averages with SEM. Paired t-test, 2-tailed, was used to analyze differences in the kinetics between B2 and B19. Analysis of variance one-way test was used to determine statistical differences between NO groups; significance was set at P < 0.05. Differential blood cell counts of B2 and B19 haplotypes (monocytes, lymphocytes, and heterophils) were analyzed with t-test, paired, 2-tailed.  Concentrations of B19 and B2 Monocytes in hole Blood ere imilar  Studies were designed to identify potential differences in the function of monocytes/macrophages purified from birds of defined haplotypes. Based on noted differences in susceptibility to avian coronavirus infection (Banat et al., 2013) , potential differences in the concentrations of circulating cell populations and specifically that of monocytes in birds with distinct haplotypes had to be established. Cell counts from peripheral blood of monocytes, lymphocytes, and heterophils were not significantly different (t-test, paired, 2-tailed) between the more resistant B2 and more susceptible B19 homozygous chickens ( Table 1) . Yields of PBMC prepared from either Ficoll-Hypaque 1.077, previously used for lymphocyte studies, or 1.083, which has been recommended for mononuclear cell enrichment in mammals (Feldman and Mogelesky, 1987) , were compared. Whereas the concentrations from birds of either haplotype were similar, the higher density gradient (1.083) yielded higher amounts of avian monocytes from PBMC derived from either haplotype ( Table 2 ). All PBMC isolations were, therefore, performed using the higher density solution.  Ex Vivo Monocytes from B2 Birds Differentiate More Readily than Those of B19 Birds  By d 4 of culture, B2 cells demonstrated distinct macrophage-like morphologies: stellate cytoplasmic processes, vacuolation, and decreased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio (N/C; Figure 1 , panel A). In contrast, differences in N/C and number of cytoplasmic processes were not evident in B19-derived cultures until 6 d postinitiation of culture (Figure 1, panel B) . Similarly, during the kinetic studies, the number of cytoplasmic processes displayed by B2 macrophages and the degree of vacuolation observed at 48 h poststimulation with IFNγ was more marked than the changes noted in B19derived cells (Figure 2 ). To verify purity of macrophage cultures, B2/B2 and B19/B19 cells were positively stained with monoclonal antibody KUL01 after 6 d of culture (Figure 3 , panels A and B).  Greater NO Production of B2-Derived Macrophages in Response to timulation  Potential differences in macrophage functions were examined following exposure to either IFNγ or poly (I:C). All stimulations were performed on d 6 of culture when monocytes/macrophages from both B2 and B19 birds were mature (Figure 2 ). Nitric oxide production served as the indicator of macrophage activation. Timed exposure (24, 48, and 72 h) of macrophages cultured 6 d to either IFNγ or poly (I:C) demonstrated the existence of functional differences between B2/B2 and B19/B19 lines of birds aged 5 to 6 wk. Beginning at 24 h postexposure to IFNγ ( Figure 4A ) and poly (I:C) ( Figure 4B ), induced NO production by macrophages derived from B19/B19 birds was significantly (P < 0.01, t = test, paired) lower compared with that by B2/B2-derived macrophages. Additionally, the responsiveness of B2/B2 cells to either stimulant was significantly greater compared with that of unstimulated control B2/B2 cells (P < 0.01). At 48 h poststimulation with poly (I:C), there was a dramatic difference in the NO concentration of B2/B2 culture (92.76 μg/mL) supernatants than that of B19/B19 cells (17.90 μg/mL; Figure 5 ). Because background NO concentration, as well as cell death, increased at 72 h, especially in the B19 cultures, stimulation of cells in subsequent experiments with poly (I:C) ( Figure 5A ) or IFNγ ( Figure 5B ) was only characterized up to the 48 h time point using age-matched birds ages 6 to 12 wk. In addition, macrophages from B8/B8, B15/B15, and B21/21 haplotypes, as well as macrophages from B2/B2 on B19 background haplotypes (B19bg B2MHC ), were stimulated with IFNγ (Table 3) . Nitric oxide release from B19bg B2MHC macrophages was very similar (86.2 μg/mL) to that from B2/B2 haplotypes, and significantly different from NO release of B19/B19 macrophages (P < 0.01). However, stimulation of B8/B8 macrophages was very variable 1 Peripheral blood cell counts (mean cells/μL ± SD) performed by Antech Diagnostics (Irvine, CA) for B2/B2 (n = 6) and B19/B19 (n = 6) chickens. Values showed no statistically significant differences between haplotypes by a paired t-test.   DISCUSSION  Inbred B haplotype chicken lines provide an excellent resource for studying the genetic bases of disease resistance and susceptibility. Several clinical studies in chickens, including an in vivo IBV infectivity study of B haplotype-defined chicks (Banat et al., 2013) , have shown an association between disease susceptibility and the MHC (Briles et al., 1983; Taylor, 2004; Goto et al., 2009) . Because differences in IBV resistance of B2/B2 chicks to clinical illness were observed early after initial infection, innate immunity was targeted in the current study. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which differences in activation of monocytes/macrophages of B haplotype-defined birds have been investigated in the context of disease resistance and susceptibility.The rate of differentiation of macrophages derived from the more resistant B2/B2 chickens and their subsequent activation in response to stimuli was dramatically greater than that of macrophages from the more IBV-susceptible B19 haplotype chickens. The consistent, significantly greater response of the B2 macrophages could potentially explain the differences observed early after IBV infection. A role of TLR3, which binds to dsRNA, is implicated in the macrophage response and ultimately in in vivo resistance (Malmgaard et al., 2004; Whitmore et al., 2004; Kogut et al., 2005; Nang et al., 2011) . Double-stranded RNA is a replication intermediate during infection with RNA viruses, such as IBV, avian influenza virus, and Newcastle disease virus (Malmgaard et al., 2004; Nang et al., 2011) . Potential functional differences related to macrophage communication with adaptive immunity were evaluated through stimulation by the lymphocyte-derived cytokine, IFNγ. The demonstrated significant differences in NO production that both poly (I:C) and IFNγ induced in the B2/B2 and the B19/B19 haplotypes may explain, at least in part, the greater resistance of birds of the homozygous B2 line to IBV-associated early onset clinical illness (Banat et al., 2013) . As Dil and Qureshi (2002) showed, expression of iNOS varies among macrophages from chickens of different genetic lines and is associated with differential TLR4 expression in response to lipopolysaccharide. Further research is necessary to analyze iNOS and TLR expression on macrophages from B2 versus B19 haplotypes to investigate if similar pathways are responsible for the difference in activation.In addition to differences in activation, even when cultured ex vivo in the absence of poly (I:C) and IFNγ, B2/B2 monocytes differentiated more readily than B19/B19 monocytes. Based on changes in morphology, B2-derived cells obtain classical features of the macrophage, such as increased cytoplasm to nuclear ratio, Nitric oxide release is shown as mean (μg/mL) ± SD by B2 and B19 macrophages at 24, 48, and 72 h poststimulation with poly (I:C); n = 8 (A) and interferon (IFN) γ; n = 6 (B). In the presence of either stimulant, NO production at all 3 time points was significantly lower in B19 than in B2 supernatants (P < 0.01, t-test, paired). Samples were taken at 6 wk of age. Color version available in the online PDF. vacuolation, and cytoplasmic pseudopod-like projections, within 4 d as compared with the 6 d required by B19-derived cells. Although the significance of the higher rate of activation is not known, this could reflect an overall lower threshold of response of the B2 cells compared with that of the B19 homozygous macrophages.Participation of pure cultures of monocytes/macrophages in these studies was confirmed by the 100% labeling by the KUL01 macrophage monoclonal antibody marker (Mast et al., 1998) . This negates any influence by contaminating lymphocytes and their regulatory cytokines. Furthermore, the cultures were plated with equivalent concentrations of monocytes/macrophages. Hence, these studies reflect differences in cell activity and not increased B2 cell numbers. Additionally, the concentration of peripherally circulating monocytes in B19 and B2 birds was not significantly different.The MHC-B locus, which has been associated with resistance to tumor-associated viruses in chickens, has also been implicated in observed differences in macrophage function (Briles et al., 1983; Taylor, 2004) . Qureshi et al. (1986 Qureshi et al. ( , 1988 demonstrated that macrophages from chickens congenic for MHC also showed differences in chemotactic activity, recruitment, and activation. The congenic B2 on the B19 background demonstrated the B2 phenotype suggesting at least for B2 and B19, the genetic difference may lie within the B locus. Monocytes derived from additional homozygous MHC haplotypes were also differentially activated by IFNγ. The cells purified from B15/B15 birds, which were shown by Bacon et al. (2004) to be more resistant to IBV infection also demonstrated greater macrophage stimulation. It is possible that genes lying outside this region could also affect macrophage activation as demonstrated in other lines. Genes lying outside the B2 apparently can influence resistance to highly pathogenic avian influenza (Hunt et al., 2010) .Sequence differences between the MHC-B region of B2 and B19 haplotypes have indicated several differences in a 14-gene region between BG and BF (Hoso-michi et al., 2008) . Likewise, genomic regions lying outside the B region could also be implicated in monocyte differentiation and activation.Future studies identifying differences in protein and mRNA expression following macrophage stimulation will provide important clues as to the genes and pathways responsible for greater resistance to illness. Our preliminary results from sequencing the RNA of stimulated macrophages of B2 and B19 haplotype chickens indicate differential regulation of at least the TLR pathway (manuscript in preparation), which is a critical pathway in innate immunity and vital to the host immune response to pathogens (Medzhitov and Janeway, 1997; Medzhitov, 2001) .In conclusion, the potential for using macrophage function to screen for resistance could be a valuable Although not significantly different, basal NO concentration was consistently greater in B19 culture supernatants (10.88 μg/mL) than in B2 supernatants (9.75 μg/mL). Following stimulation, NO production by B2 cells (98.12 μg/mL) was significantly greater than that by B19 macrophages (17.19 μg/mL; P < 0.01, one-way ANOVA). Values are reported as mean with SE, n = 28. B: Nitric oxide release by interferon (IFN)γ-stimulated B2 and B19 macrophages. Cells were stimulated for 48 h with 50 pg/mL of ch-IFNγ. Although not significantly different, basal NO concentration was consistently greater in B19 culture supernatants (11.88 μg/mL) than in B2 supernatants (8.7 μg/mL). Following stimulation, NO production was significantly greater in B2 culture supernatants (92.76 μg/mL) than in B19 culture supernatants (17.9 μg/mL; P < 0.01, one-way ANOVA).

The B2 and B19bg B2MHC exhibit the largest nitric oxide release compared with other haplotypes. asset in breeding programs. Furthermore, the chicken is an exceptional resource for deciphering MHC-related mechanisms behind disease resistance. Although chickens with various defined B haplotypes have previously been shown to differ in their responses to pathogens, the cellular differences described in these studies provide a basis for future work characterizing the molecular and genetic basis of immune-mediated resistance. These studies provide a background for eventually establishing lines with resistance to infection or with enhanced immunity to vaccines.  					1			
16854374	Hsp70 functions as a negative regulator of West Nile virus capsid protein through direct interaction	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117540/	West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the Flavivirus family and induces febrile illness, sporadic encephalitis, and paralysis. The capsid (Cp) of WNV is thought to play a role in inducing these symptoms through caspase-3- and caspase-9-dependent apoptosis. Using WNVCp as bait for a yeast two-hybrid assay, we identified that Hsp70 interacted with WNVCp. The interaction between Hsp70 and WNVCp was further substantiated using purified proteins. Deletion analysis of Hsp70 indicated that WNVCp could bind to the substrate binding domain of Hsp70. The presence of WNVCp in the Hsp70-dependent folding system inhibited the refolding of β-galactosidase (β-gal), which showed that WNVCp might function as a negative regulator of Hsp70. Finally, the cytotoxic effect of WNVCp in 293T cells was prevented by ectopic Hsp70, suggesting a negative regulatory role of Hsp70 on WNVCp. Our findings suggest a possible negative regulatory role of Hps70 in the pathway of WNV infection.	  Eukaryotic Hsp70s are highly abundant cytosolic and nuclear molecular chaperones that play essential roles in various aspects of protein homeostasis, including protein synthesis, transportation, degradation, and folding [1] . Transient interactions between Hsp70 and unfolded polypeptides maintain its substrates in soluble, intermediate folded states and prevent protein misfolding and aggregation. Moreover, the intermediate substrates are subsequently folded into their native forms by the machinery of the Hsp70 chaperone [2] [3] [4] . This is accomplished, in part, by the help of a subclass of proteins known as cochaperones, which modulate the chaperone function of Hsp70 and its association with other partner proteins.Hsp70 co-chaperones can mostly be classified into three classes: the enhancers (Hsp40, GrpE, and Hip), which positively regulate Hsp70-dependent folding; the negative regulators (Bag-1, Scythe, and Chip), which inhibit the chaperone function of Hsp70; and the coadapters (Hop and Hip), which connect Hsp70 with various other co-chaperones and chaperones to form multimeric chaperone complexes [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .Hsp40, which couples the ATP hydrolyzing activity of Hsp70 with its substrate interaction, is required for the folding function of Hsp70 [2] [3] [4] . On the other hand, Escherichia coli DnaK, a homologue of Hsp70, requires the nucleotide exchange factor, GrpE, for full-folding activity; DnaJ, a Hsp40 orthologue, is also required [8, 14] . These are essential partner proteins of Hsp70 that enhance Hsp70-dependent folding. The tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains of Hop (p60) link the multi-complex chaperone structures of Hsp70 and Hsp90; this linking helps to maintain the proper conformations of progesterone or estrogen aporeceptors prior to hormone binding [7, 11, 15] . Bag1 and Scythe are negative regulators of Hsp70-dependent folding processes [9, 10, 13] . They were initially found to interact with the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, and the apoptotic mediator, Reaper, respectively [16] . Bag1 and Scythe share common structural features, namely the carboxyl-terminal Bag-domain that interacts with Hsp70 and the amino-terminal ubiquitin-like motif, the function of which is not well characterized [17] .West Nile virus (WNV) is part of the Flaviviridae family, and it is capable of inducing febrile syndrome, meningitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, flaccid paralysis, and death [18, 19] . It contains single-stranded RNA, which encodes the capsid (Cp), envelope, premembrane proteins, and 7 non-structural proteins that have been implicated in viral replication [20, 21] . WNV has been found to induce cell death via the Bax-dependent pathway in several cancer and brain cell lines, as well as in mice [22, 23] . It was first suggested that the Cp of WNV (WNVCp) was able to induce caspase-9-and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis [24] . Later, WNV non-structural proteins 2B and 3 (NS2B-NS3) were found to induce apoptosis through the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 [25] . However, the detailed mechanism of the cytotoxic effects of WNV is not yet fully understood.In these studies, we have shown that WNVCp was able to bind to Hps70 and to function as a negative regulator of Hsp70. Furthermore, WNVCp was able to induce cell cycle arrest in 293T cells. This cytotoxic effect was prevented when Hsp70 was overexpressed, which suggests that, as a molecular chaperone, Hsp70 might have a protective effect against WNV infection. These findings are expected to contribute to the identification of the infectious pathway induced by WNVCp.  Materials and methods  Plasmids. pGBK-T7-WNVCp, a bait plasmid for yeast two-hybrid screening, was created by cloning an EcoRI-XhoI fragment from pcDNA3-His-WNVCp into pGBK-T7 (Clontech). pcDNA3-HA-WNVCp and pET28a-His-WNVCp were prepared by subcloning an EcoRI-XhoI fragment from pcDNA3-his-WNVCp into pcDNA3-HA and pET28a-His (Invitrogen). The bacterial expression plasmids for Hsp70 and Hsp70AAAA were used as described previously [2] . Hsp70 mammalian expression vector, pcDNA/HA-Hsp70, was used as described previously (Nollen et al. [10] ). pcDNA3.1/Luciferase was obtained from pGL3 (Promega) using XbaI and HindIII restriction, and was subcloned into plasmid pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). All DNA constructs were produced by PCR and sequenced.Yeast two-hybrid screening. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer using the pretransformed MATCHMAKER human brain cDNA library (Clontech). In brief, pGBK-T7-WNVCp was transformed into yeast strain AH109. The transformants containing bait plasmid were mated with the pre-transformed human brain cDNA library. Candidates for two-hybrid interaction were initially selected on SD (-His, -Leu, -Trp) medium and further confirmed on SD (-Ade, -His, -Leu, -Trp) medium containing X-gal. The plasmid DNA was isolated from the positive clones and sequenced according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To further confirm the interaction between WNVCp and Jab1, Y187 and AH109, each of which contained pGAD-T7-Jab1 and pGBK-T7-WNVCp, respectively, were mated and tested using SD (-Ade, -His, -Leu, -Trp) medium containing X-gal.Cell biology. A human cancer cell line, 293T (kidney carcinoma), was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 1% penicillin/ streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine plus reagent (Invitrogen) or Welfect (Wellgene) according to the recommendations of the manufacturers. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and Western blot analysis were carried out as described previously [17] .Biochemical analyses. Recombinant Hsp40, Hsp70, ATPase domain, SBD, and Hsp70AAAA were expressed and purified as described previously [2, 26] . His-WNVCp was prepared according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). In brief, BL21 cells, which were transformed with pET28a-His-wnvcp or pET28a-His-P5/8A, were treated with IPTG (1 mM) at 25°C. The crude extract was prepared using lysozyme (Sigma). The extract was resolved over the Resource Q (35 ml, Pharmacia-LKB), His-bind resin (20 ml, Novagen), and DEAE column (50 ml, Pharmacia-LKB). Fractions containing His-WNVCp was concentrated using a Centriprep-30 (Millipore). Concentrations of proteins were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce, IL) relative to standard BSA (Pierce, IL). Folding assays of guanidine-HCl denatured b-galactosidase and luciferase (Sigma, MO) followed existing protocols [2, 26] . The pull-down experiment was carried out as described previously [17] . Immunofluorescence staining was carried out as follows. Cells were plated in six-well plates with coverslips; transfections were performed using lipofectamine reagent. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBS (Invitrogen), and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. The cells were then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (Santa Cruz) in PBS for 30 min and incubated overnight with specific primary antibody at room temperature. The samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse or Alexa 594 anti-rabbit antibodies (each diluted at 1:400) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were stained with DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Sigma) for 5 min. The slides were analyzed using confocal or immunofluorescent microscopes (Carl Zeiss Vision, LSM510 and 5203 Axiophot, respectively, Oberkochen).FACS analysis. For FACS analysis, 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3-HA-WNVCp, with or without pcDNA/HA-Hsp70. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested using trypsin and were subsequently fixed with 70% EtOH. After washing three times with PBS, the fixed cells were incubated with RNase A (1 lg/ml) at 37°C for 1 h, followed by treatment with propidium iodide (PI) (50 lg/ml) for 30 min. Stained cells were detected by flow cytometric analysis (Becton-Dickinson). Data were analyzed using CellQuest Pro software (Becton-Dickinson).Antibodies and chemicals. Hsp70 (SPA810) was purchased from Stressgen. Luciferase (L0159) and Flag (M2) antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse and Alexa 594 anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Alexa.  Results and discussion  WNVCp could bind to Hsp70 independently of ATP WNVCp is known to induce apoptosis by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase-9 activation in tissue culture (24) . Furthermore, when its gene is delivered to mouse brain or skeletal muscle, it can cause cell death and inflammation in vivo (24) . To further identify the functional role of WNVCp, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid assay using the entire region of WNVCp as bait. The result showed that several chaperones, including Hsp70, were able to bind to WNVCp. To confirm the binding ability of Hsp70 to WNVCp, recombinant Hsp70 and His-WNVCp were purified (Fig. 1A) . The interaction between purified recombinant proteins was tested using a Ni + -agarose pull-down assay (Fig. 1B) . The results indicated that Hsp70 was able to bind to WNVCp (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2) . ATP was added to the reaction system to exclude the possibility of denatured WNVCp binding to Hsp70 as an unfolded substrate (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4) . As a control, recombinant Hsp70 was shown not to bind to Ni + -agarose non-specifically (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6) . It is known that the presence of ATP facilitates the release of unfolded substrate from Hsp70 [1] . As a control, we carried out an interaction between Hsp70 and chemically denatured luciferase in the presence or absence of ATP (Fig. 1C) . The data indicated that, in the presence of ATP, the denatured substrates did not bind to Hsp70 (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4) . The immunoprecipitation assays of ectopic WNVCp overexpressed in a human kidney tumor cell line, 293T, with endogenous Hsp70 showed that the WNVCp and Hsp70 bind in cells, indicating physiologically viable interaction between the two proteins (Fig. 1C) . Overall, the interaction between Hsp70 and WNVCp was not affected, which suggests that WNVCp could bind to Hsp70 as a binding partner rather than binding to unfolded substrates. Furthermore, Hsp70 could directly bind to WNVCp independently of ATP.WNVCp could function as a negative regulator of Hsp70 by binding to its substrate binding domain (SBD)To further confirm the interaction between Hsp70 and WNVCp, we carried out refolding assays using purified Hsp70 and Hdj1 as folding mediators and b-gal and luciferase that had been chemically denatured by guanidium-HCl as substrates. This assay allows us to examine whether WNVCp could still bind to Hsp70 in the presence of its co-chaperone, Hsp40, and whether it could still function as a regulator of Hsp70. The data indicated that WNVCp was able to suppress 50% of the b-gal folding activities of Hsp70 when the ratio of WNVCp and Hsp70 was 1:1. When the ratio of Hsp70 and WNVCp was 1:2, the folding of bgal was almost completely suppressed, indicating that WNVCp could function as a potent inhibitor of Hsp70 inhibitor ( Fig. 2A) . Similar results were obtained using luciferase as unfolded substrate (Fig. 2B) .The regulation of Hsp70 by the Hsp70 partner proteins could take place through their binding to ATPase domain or SBD of Hsp70. For example, Hop, SGT, and TPR are individually known to interact with Hsp70 through its conserved carboxyl-terminal EEVD regulatory motif, while Bag1 and Hip interact with the ATPase domain [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] 11, 18, 26] . To examine the domain of Hsp70 responsible for binding with WNVCp, we purified the recombinant ATPase domain or SBD of Hsp70 (Fig. 1A) . The data indicated that the SBD was responsible for the interaction between Hsp70 and WNVCp (Fig. 3A) . Because WNVCp binds to the SBD, we further tested 3 and 4) of ATP, and protein complexes were precipitated (P: precipitated, lanes 2, 4, and 6) by Ni 2+ -agarose. Precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. (C) Reaction mixtures containing Hsp70 (0.5 lM) and luciferase that had been chemically denatured by guanidium-HCl (0.5 lM) (lanes 1-4) were incubated (T: total, lanes 1 and 3) in the absence (lanes 1 and 2) or presence (lanes 3 and 4) of ATP, and protein complexes were precipitated (P: precipitated, lanes 2, 4, and 6) by Hsp70 antibody (5a5). Precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using mono-Hsp70 mouse (5a5) and poly-luciferase rabbit (L0159) antibodies. (D) The plasmid expressing HA-WNVCp was transfected into 293T cells. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA mouse antibodies. The whole cell extract (WCE) and immunoprecipitates (IP) were detected using anti-HA rabbit and anti-Hsp70 mouse antibodies.whether the carboxyl-terminal EEVD motif was required for the interaction between the two proteins. The EEVD motif is considered to be important for its role in linking the SBD and ATPase domain of Hsp70, which enables the crosstalk between the two domains [2] . Furthermore, this motif is considered important for the refolding activities of Hsp70, since the lack of this motif terminates the refolding activities of Hsp70 [2] . To identify the role of EEVD motif in the interaction between Hsp70 and WNVCp, we employed the HSP70AAAA mutant. In this mutant, the four amino acids, EEVD, of the C-terminus are changed to AAAA [2] . When this mutant was purified as a recombinant protein, it was easily degraded to the ATPase domain and SBD [2] . Thus, the purified proteins displayed both full-length Hsp70AAAA and ATPase domain (Fig. 3B) . The data showed that this mutant was not able to bind to WNVCp, which suggested that the C-terminus might function as a motif for the interaction with WNVCp (Fig. 3B) .WNVCp has been known to localize to the nucleoli when expressed alone [24] . Thus, we next tested whether the expression of Hsp70 could affect the localization of WNVCp. When both proteins were expressed, we found that WNVCp, usually localized to the nucleoli, was dispersed into the cytoplasm (Fig. 4) . These results indicate that WNVCp could interact with Hsp70 in the cells. 1 and 3) , and protein complexes were precipitated (P: lanes 2 and 4) by Ni 2+ -agarose. Precipitated proteins were analyzed as described in Fig. 1B. Furthermore, the interaction seems to affect the cellular localization of WNVCp from the nucleoli to the cytoplasm. It is not certain, however, whether Hsp70 participates in the nuclear export of WNVCp or inhibits its localization of WNVCp into the nucleoli. Taken together, WNVCp was able to bind to the substrate domain of Hsp70 and inhibited its folding activities. Conversely, Hsp70 seems to be able to induce the cytoplasmic localization of WNVCp through direct interaction.Hsp70 has a protective role against the cytotoxic effect of WNVCp Various viral proteins have been known to localize to the nucleoli, which could strategically aid in the propagation of many viruses. These proteins usually participate in the disruption of cytokinesis of mammalian cells, as seen in the N protein of the coronavirus and the capsid of human hepatitis B virus [27, 28] . It is also likely that the WNVCp might have disruptive activities against mammalian cells by localizing to the nucleoli. Moreover, the prevention of the nucleolus localization of WNVCp by Hsp70 might protect cells from the cytotoxic effect of WNVCp (Fig. 4) . To examine the cellular effect of WNVCp, we transfected the plasmid expressing WNVCp into the 293T cells and observed the cell cycle in the 293T cells. The data showed that WNVCp-induced G 2 arrest in 293T cells ( Fig. 5A and B, lane 2) . When Hsp70 was co-expressed, the cytotoxic effect of WNVCp was extinguished, which indicates that Hsp70 has a protective role against WNVCp ( Fig. 5A and B, lane 4) . It is assumed that, by forming a complex, Hsp70 inhibited the localization of WNVCp to the nucleoli and prevented the cytotoxic effect of the viral protein. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that Hsp70 is able to indirectly protect the cells from cytotoxic effects imposed by WNVCp, since Hsp70 generally functions against various stresses exerted on cells [1] . Our findings suggest that WNVCp could function as a negative regulator of Hsp70 chaperone activities by binding to the substrate binding domain of Hsp70 (Fig. 2) . At the same time, the cellular stresses imposed by WNVCp could be protected against by the ectopic expression of Hsp70 (Fig. 5) . WNVCp does not seem to bind to Hsp70 as an unfolded substrate, which could prevent its chaperoning of other substrates, as ATP did not have any effects on the binding abilities of Hsp70 and WNVCp (Fig. 1) . Thus, it is possible that Hsp70 might function as a negative regulatory protein of WNVCp, which weakened the cytotoxic effects of WNVCp. However, it is still not clear from these studies whether the toxic effect of WNV itself could be prevented by the overexpression of Hsp70. Furthermore, it has not yet been determined whether infection with WNV induced the expression of Hsp70, which, in turn, might function to protect cells from WNV-induced death. However, our studies suggest the possible role of Hsp70 as a protector of the cell against infection with WNV through the suppression of one of the toxic proteins of WNV. Although further studies are required to determine the detailed mechanistic pathways involved in the relationship between Hsp70 and WNV infection, this is a novel finding that suggests how WNV protein could be negatively controlled by the proteins of host cells. We expect that this finding will aid investigators in identifying the mechanistic pathway of how mammalian cells adjust to the WNV infection.  				1	1			
23395875	Unfolded protein response pathways regulate Hepatitis C virus replication via modulation of autophagy	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124205/	BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress which, in turn, activates the unfolding protein response (UPR). UPR activates three distinct signalling pathways. Additionally, UPR induces autophagy (UPR-autophagy pathways). On the other hand, it has become clear that some positive-single-strand RNA viruses utilize autophagy. Some groups have used the siRNA silencing approach to show that autophagy is required for HCV RNA replication. However, the mechanism of induction of the UPR-autophagy pathways remain unclear in the cells with HCV. Method and results: we used a genome-length HCV RNA (strain O of genotype 1b) replication system (OR6) in hepatoma cells (HuH-7-derived OR6 cells). As control, we used OR6c cells from which the HCV genome had been removed by treatment with interferon-α. The UPR-autophagy pathways were activated to a greater degree in the OR6 cells as compared to the OR6c cells. Rapamycin, mTOR-independent autophagy inducer, activated HCV replication in the OR6 cells. On the other hand, HCV replication in the cells was inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3-MA), which is an inhibitor of autophagy. Salubrinal (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2(eIF2)-alpha phosphatase inhibitor), 3-ethoxy-5, 6-dibromosalicylaldehyde (X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) splicing inhibitor) and sp600125 (c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) inhibitor) inhibited HCV replication and autophagy. Additionally, HCV replication and autophagy were inhibited more strongly by combination of these inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that UPR-autophagy pathways exert an influence on HCV replication. Therefore, control these pathways may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy against replication of HCV.	Introduction  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [1] . With over 170 million people chronically infected with HCV worldwide, this disease has emerged as a serious global health problem. HCV is an enveloped flavivirus with a 9.6-kb positive single-strand RNA genome [2] . Development of a HCV RNA replicon capable of replication in the human hepatoma cell line Huh7 has been a significant advance [3, 4] .HCV replication occurs in a ribonucleoprotein replication complex associated with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived membranous web [5] . Some groups have shown that HCV protein disrupts normal ER functions and induces ER stress [6, 7] . Mammalian cells trigger a response called the unfolded protein response (UPR) to cope with abnormal ER functions and ER stress [8] [9] [10] . UPR activates three distinct signalling pathways, namely, the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF-6) pathway, the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) pathway and the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway [11] [12] [13] . Some groups have reported the existence of some relationships among the three kinds of UPR-autophagy pathways [14, 15] . Autophagy is a major intracellular pathway involved in the degradation and recycling of long-lived proteins and cytoplasmic organelles, and plays an essential role in the maintenance of homeostasis in response to starvation and other cellular stresses [16] . On the other hand, autophagy also plays important roles in a variety of other cellular processes, including restriction of intracellular pathogen multiplication. Recently, the significance of autophagy in the establishment of virus infection has become clear; in particular, some positive single-strand RNA viruses utilize autophagy to generate the cytoplasmic membrane structures that they require for genome replication [17] . HCV has also been shown to induce ER stress and trigger UPR [18] [19] [20] [21] . Furthermore, UPR activation has been proposed to be responsible for subsequent induction of autophagy [22] . However, the induction of UPRautophagy pathways by HCV has not been defined elucidated yet.In this study, we attempted to examine the influence on HCV replication of the UPR-autophagy pathways, using a genomelength HCV RNA (strain O of genotype 1b) replication system (OR6) with luciferase as the reporter, which facilitated prompt and precise monitoring of HCV RNA replication in hepatoma cells (HuH-7-derived OR6 cells).  Reagents and antibodies  3-Ethoxy-5, 6-dibromosalicylaldehyde (3-E-5, 6-D), tunicamycin (TM), rapamycin, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), and interferon (IFN)-alpha were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). sp600125 and Salubrinal were purchased from Calbiochem (Los Angeles, CA, USA). Anti-Core (CP11) was purchased from Institute of Immunology (Institute of Immunology, Tokyo, Japan), anti-nonstructure protein (NS) 4A from abcam (abcam, Cambridge, UK); anti-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and anti-p62 were purchased from Medical & Biological Laboratories (MBL, Tokyo, Japan), and anti-eIF2-alpha, anti-phospholylated-Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 (eIF2)-alpha, anti-IRE1, anti-c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), anti-phospholylated-JNK, anti-c-Jun, anti-phospholylated-c-Jun and anti-GAPDH from Cell Signaling (Cell Signaling, Inc.).  Cell cultures  OR6 cells have been described in detail by Ikeda et al. [23] . The OR6 cell line is a clone of ORN/C-5B/KE (Strain O of genotype 1b) RNA replicating Huh-7 cells. OR6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin and G418 (300 lg/ml; Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) and passaged twice a week at a 5:1 split ratio. Control cells (OR6c) were established by eliminating genomelength HCV RNA from the OR6 cells by IFN-alpha treatment (500 IU/ml for 2 weeks; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) without G418, as described previously.  RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis  Total RNA was isolated using the RNA Prep mini kit (QIAGEN).Template cDNA synthesis was carried out with 1 lg of total RNA using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Applyed Biosystems, Inc.). One-tenth of the synthesized cDNA was subjected to PCR with the following primer pairs: XBP-1, 5 0 -TTACGAGAGAAAACT-CATGGC-3 0 and 5 0 -GGGTCCAAGTTGTCCAGAATGC-3 0 ; HCV, 5 0 -AGA-GCCATAGTGGTCTGCGG-3 0 and 5 0 -CAAGCACCCTATCAGGCAGTA-3 0 ; and GAPDH, 5 0 -GACTCATGACCACAGTCCATGC-3 0 and 5 0 -GAG-GAGACCACCTGGTGCTCAG-3 0 .  Western blot analysis  For Western blot analysis, 4À4.5 Â 10 4 cells harboring OR6 cells were plated on six-well plates and cultured for 24 h, and treated with each of the reagents for 72 h. Samples were subjected to native gel and 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [24] . The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and reacted with the appropriate antibodies. The immune complexes were visualized with Super Signal West Femto substrate (Pierce) and detected using an LAS-3000 image analyzer system (Fujifilm).  Fluorescent microscopy  Cells were cultured on glass slides and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature for 30 min. After two washes with PBS, the cells were permeabilized at room temperature for 20 min with PBS containing 0.25% saponin, and then blocked with PBS containing 0.2% gelatin (gelatin-PBS) for 60 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with gelatin-PBS containing appropriate antibodies at 37°C for 60 min and washed three times with PBS containing 1% Tween 20 (PBST). The resulting cells were incubated with gelatin-PBS containing the corresponding fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies at 37°C for 60 min and then washed three times with PBST. The stained cells were covered with VECTA-SHIELD Ò Mounting Medium containing DAPI (4 0 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Vector Laboratories Inc.) and observed under a FluoView FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus).  Renilla luciferase (RL) assay  To monitor the effects of the reagents, the RL assay was performed as described previously [25] . Briefly, the cells were plated onto 24-well plates (2 Â 10 4 cells per well) in triplicate and cultured with the medium in the absence of G418 for 24 h. The cells were then treated with each reagent at various concentrations for 72 h. After treatment, the cells were subjected to a luciferase assay using the RL assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). After these assays, the 50% effective concentration (EC50) of each reagent for HCV replication was determined.  WST-1 cell proliferation assay  The cells were plated onto 96-well plates (1 Â 10 3 cells per well) in triplicate and then treated with various concentrations of the reagents for 72 h. After the treatment, the cells were subjected to the WST-1 cell proliferation assay (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Based on these assay results, the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of the reagents was estimated. The selective index (SI) values of the reagents were also estimated by dividing the CC50 values by the EC50 values.  Statistical analysis  The luciferase activities were statistically compared between the various treatment groups using Student's t-test. P values of <0.05 were considered to signify statistically significant differences. The means ± standard deviations were determined from at least three independent experiments.  HCV induced activation of UPR and autophagy  To determine whether autophagy was induced in the OR6 cells, we investigated the phosphoethanolamine (PE) conjugation of LC3 in the OR6 cells showing autonomous replication of HCV RNA. The amount of LC3-II was significantly increased in the OR6 cells as compared to the OR6c cells (Fig. 1A) . Autophagy is involved in the response to ER stress, which is represented by UPR; in this case, double-membrane vesicles are formed but do not fuse with the lysosomes. Accumulation of p62 has been reported to be caused by lysosomal fusion inhibition [14, 15] . Also, in our experiment, significant accumulation of p62 was observed in the OR6 cells (Fig. 1A ). Fig. 1B shows an increase in the amount of phosphorylated eIF2-alpha (Ser51) [9] in the OR6 cells as compared to the OR6c cells, suggesting that the PERK pathway was activated by HCV. Fig. 1C indicates the increase in the amount of spliced XBP1 in the OR6 cells as compared to the OR6c cells, suggesting that the ATF-6 and IRE1 pathways were activated too [10, 26] . Fig. 1D shows an increase in the amount of IRE1 in the OR6 cells as compared to the OR6c cells. Moreover, increases in the amounts of phosphorylated JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) and phosphorylated c-Jun (Ser63) were also observed in the OR6 cells as compared to the OR6c cells (Fig. 1D) , suggesting that the IRE1 pathway was activated as well [8] .On the other hand, treatment of Huh7 cells with tunicamycin, which triggers UPR by inhibiting glycosylation, resulted in activation of the ATF-6, PERK and IRE1 pathways. These results confirm that the delay in the appearance of UPR was not due to an inherent defect in the Huh7 cells (Fig. S1B , S1C and S1D). Tunicamycin treat-ment also induced LC3-II and p62 accumulation (Fig. S1A) . These data confirm that the HCV replicon cells showed activation of both autophagy and UPR (Fig. 1) .  Autophagy regulates HCV replication in the HCV replicon cells  We investigated whether activation of autophagy had any influence on the HCV replication. Rapamycin, a mTOR-independent autophagy inducer [27] , enhanced HCV replication and formation of autophagosomes in the OR6 cells, whereas 3-MA, an inhibitor of autophagy [27] , suppressed HCV replication and formation of autophagosomes in the OR6 cells ( Fig. 2A and B) . These data suggest that autophagy seems to somehow facilitate HCV replication.  UPR inhibitors can suppress HCV replication and autophagy  Salubrinal is a selective inhibitor of the phosphatase complexes that dephosphorylate eIF2-alpha in PERK pathway [28] . 3-E-5, 6-D selectively inhibits XBP-1 splicing [29] . sp600125 down-regulates the expression of IRE1 and dephosphorylates JNK [30] . To further investigate whether inhibition of the UPR-autophagy pathway might affect the rate of HCV replication, we determined the EC50, CC50 and SI values of Salubrinal (eIF2-alpha inhibitor), 3-E-5, 6-D (X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) inhibitor) and sp600125 (JNK inhibitor) using the OR6 assay system. The results for the EC50, CC50 and SI values were as follows: (Salubrinal: EC50; 6.25 lM, CC50 > 100 lM, SI > 16 (Fig. 3A) , 3-E-5, 6-D: EC50; 2 lM, CC50; 20 lM, SI; 10 ( Fig. 3B ) and sp600125: EC50; 1 lM, CC50; 12.5 lM, SI; 12.5 (Fig. 3C) . Meanwhile, the percentage of viable cells was determined by the WST-1 assay. Cytotoxic effects were observed at >25 lM of the Salubrinal (Fig. 3A) , >6.25 lM of the 3-E-5, 6-D (Fig. 3B) , and >3.13 lM of the sp600125 (Fig. 3C) .On the other hand, no cytotoxic effects were observed in the presence of <12.5 lM of the Salubrinal (Fig. 3A) , <3.13 lM of the 3-E-5, 6-D (Fig. 3B) , and <1.56 lM of the sp600125 (Fig. 3C ). In addition, autophagosome formation in the OR6 cells was decreased in the presence of EC50 concentrations of the Salubrinal, 3-E-5, 6-D and sp600125 (Fig. 3D) .  Combined treatment with the UPR inhibitors resulted in efficient suppression of HCV replication and autophagy  We found these inhibitors resulted in efficient suppression of HCV replication and autophagy. We then attempted to clarify which of the three UPR-autophagy pathways might be most closely involved in the activation of autophagy by investigating the effects of combined use of the Salubrinal, 3-E-5, 6-D and sp600125 on the rate of HCV replication using the OR6 assay system. Salubrinal inhibited phasphorylated eIF2-alpha, LC3-II and HCV core protein, but not inhibited spliced XBP1 and phasphorylated JNK. 3-E-5, 6-D and sp600125 inhibited phasphorylated JNK, spliced XBP1, LC3-II and HCV core protein, but not inhibited phasphorylated eIF2-alpha. Combined treatment with three inhibitors of Salubrinal, 3-E-5, 6-D and sp600125 strongly enhanced the inhibition of both HCV replication and autophagy. These results indicated that combined use of the inhibitors was more effective than use of any of the inhibitors alone in suppressing HCV replication and autophagy (Fig. 4) . In addition, the concentrations of each of the inhibitors used in combination did not affect the cell viability rate (Fig. 4) . Thus, in regard to the efficacy of inhibition for HCV replication and autophagy, combined use of 3-E-5, 6-D and sp600125 appears to be the most efficient as compared to use of other combinations.  4.1.  In this study, we showed, using a replicon system, activation by HCV of the three main signaling pathways from UPR to autophagy ( Fig. 1) In regard to the UPR-ATF6-XBP1 pathway, Tardif KD et al. reported, from a study using subgenomic replicons, that HCV suppresses the IRE1-XBP1 pathway to stimulate the synthesis of its viral proteins [31] . The differences from our results could be attributable to the fact that we used full-genome replicon or different HCV strain for our experiments. In addition, some other groups have shown that HCV induces ER stress and UPR activation [18] [19] [20] [21] .On the other hand, several groups have reported that autophagy and/or autophagy genes are likely to play both antiviral and proviral roles in the life cycles and pathogenesis of many different virus families. Especially, replication and spread of some positive-strand RNA viruses are regulated by their interactions with the host autophagy machinery [17] . Components of the autophagic machinery seem to be subverted to promote replication of RNA viruses, such as in the case of infections with the coronavirus [mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)], poliovirus, or rhinoviruses 2 and 14, by generation of a membrane scaffold for RNA replication [32, 33] . We then attempted to determine if inhibitors of UPR signaling might control HCV replication and autophagy by inhibiting the signaling pathways from URP to autophagy (Figs. 2 and 3) . Our results showed that Salubrinal (eIF2-alpha phosphatase inhibitor), 3-E-5, 6-D (XBP-1 inhibitor) and sp600125 (JNK inhibitor) could regulate HCV replication and autophagy in the OR6 cells (Fig. 3) . Next, we attempted to determine combinated inhibitiors which UPR-autophagy pathways might have the greatest influence in the regulation of HCV replication. When the concentrations of the inhibitors used were under the EC50, the cell viability of the HCV replicons was almost 100%. In particular, combined treatment with the 3-E-5, 6-D (XBP-1 splicing inhibitor) and sp600125 (JNK inhibitor) was the most efficient at reducing HCV replication (Fig. 4) . Some interesting findings have been reported previously. eIF2-alpha phosphatase inhibits the assembly of the 80S ribosome and inhibits protein synthesis [34] . On the other hand, IRE1 and ATF6 promote transcription of the UPR target genes. IRE1 and ATF6 process XBP1 mRNA to generate mature XBP1 mRNA. Spliced XBP1 binds directly to the ER stress response element and unfolded protein response elements and activates transcription of the molecular chaperones of the ER. JNK activation, mediated by IRE1, is required for autophagosome formation [35] . The PERK pathway is independent of UPR, however, the IRE1 and ATF6 pathways play complementary roles in UPR signaling [36] [37] [38] . These findings indicate that inhibition of UPR-autophagy pathways may have significant influence in the suppression of HCV replication, and 3-E-5, 6-D and sp600125 might inhibit strongly HCV replication and autophagy.In conclusion, HCV stimulates the three signaling pathways from UPR to autophagy. Salubrinal (eIF2-alpha phosphatase inhibitor), 3-E-5, 6-D (XBP-1 inhibitor) and sp600125 (JNK inhibitor) acted as a potent anti-autophagy agent and limit both inhibition of autophagy and HCV replication. We lead to the notion that HCV may hijack the UPR-autophagy pathway for HCV replication (Fig. 5 ). Our study demonstrates control of the UPR-autophagy pathway machinery as a possible antiviral drug target. Combined treatment with inhibitors of UPR signaling enhanced the inhibition of HCV replication. The effects of combined treatment with Salubrinal (eIF2-alpha phosphatase inhibitor), 3-E-5, 6-D (XBP-1 splicing inhibitor) and sp600125 (JNK inhibitor) on HCV replication in the OR6 assay system were examined. OR6 cells were treated with the reagents for 72 h, following which the RL assay (bar graph) and WST-1 assay (line graph) were performed. The relative values (%) calculated at each point, with the level in the non-treated cells set at 100%, are presented here. Western blot analysis of the treated cells for the HCV core protein and LC3 was also performed (lower panels).   				1	1			
25577675	Interactions between parasitic infections and reproductive efficiency in sheep	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130998/	Abstract This review article summarises the many reports in the literature, confirming that, in sheep, parasitic infections can adversely affect reproductive efficiency; examples, which refer to all parts of the reproductive cycle of sheep, are as follows: trichostrongylosis in ewe-lambs (which can lead to delayed attainment of puberty), myiosis of the prepuce (which can cause impediment of mating), chorioptic mange or trypanosomosis in rams (which can lead to testicular degeneration or azoospermia, respectively), trypanosomosis or sarcoptic mange in pre-conceptual ewes (which can lead to poor conception rates or reduced number of ovulations, respectively), toxoplasmosis or neosporosis in pregnant ewes (which are causes of abortion), trichostrongylosis or trematode infections in lactating ewes (which can cause reduction of milk yield and can be a risk factor for mastitis, respectively), cryptosporidiosis in newborn lambs (which can be a cause of deaths), coccidiosis in growing pre-weaned lambs (which can cause suboptimal growth rate). In other cases, the reproductive status of the animal can influence the parasitic infection; examples are as follows: the increase in faecal parasitic output during the peri-parturient period (as a consequence of the peri-parturient relaxation of immunity), the heavier trichostrongylid infections of twin lambs compared to lambs from single parities (as a consequence of developmental origin issues in twin lambs). All the above examples support the idea of presence of interactions between parasitic infections and reproductive efficiency in sheep.	Introduction  In sheep, 'reproductive efficiency' includes the ability of ewes to ovulate, be mated, conceive with semen from fertile rams, carry foetuses to term and, finally, lamb live-born lambs, which will be weaned in the appropriate time at an optimal bodyweight. The term implies efficient conception through active gametes, uninterrupted pregnancy, normal delivery of the newborn(s) ('eutocia'), unimpaired lactation Within this frame, trichostrongylid gastrointestinal infections currently are among the major challenges in sheep health management, due to the widespread anthelmintic resistance in many parts of the world Torres-Acosta et al., 2012) , which increases potential adverse effects in health and welfare of animals.The present paper reviews and discusses interactions between parasitic infections and reproductive efficiency in sheep. The article focuses only on direct effects of parasites on the reproductive efficiency of sheep. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that many arthropods (flies, midges, ticks, etc.) can transmit various infective agents, which may adversely affect the reproductive efficiency of sheep. Examples of such agents include Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Stuen and Longbottom, 2011) , as well as various viruses, e.g., the Bluetongue virus (Osburn, 2007) , the Rift Valley Fever virus (Bath, 2007) and the Schmallenberg virus (Lievaart-Peterson et al., 2012) , which have a foetopathic and/or abortifacient effect. In this article, the topics are organised in a pattern according to the reproductive cycle of small ruminants.  Attainment of puberty by ewe-lambs  Puberty is the end point of a series of events affecting the development of the 'hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal' axis leading to reproductive competence. From a practical point of view, puberty for females is the age at which the animal can support pregnancy to term. Puberty is a complex mechanism involving primarily the reactivation of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretory system, affected by various factors (Senger, 2003; Ebling, 2005) . Among those, energy-deprived animals have been found to have a delayed puberty that has been attributed to a lesser frequency of GnRH pulses and accordingly of luteinizing hormone (LH) pulses I'anson et al., 1997; Polkowska et al., 2003) . The age at which ewe-lambs are mated, is crucial for productivity of a flock, since cost is high for maintaining unbred animals in a flock. Management of ewe-lambs for enhanced reproductive performance requires increased energy availability. This can be achieved by either increasing energy intake by the animal (i.e., availability of high-energy ration or increased quantity of feed) or by reducing its energy drains (e.g., anthelmintic treatment) . Possibly therefore, parasitic infections can have an effect in attainment of puberty through interaction with energy intake as discussed herebelow.There is evidence that parasitic infections, specifically gastrointestinal trichostrongylid or Trypanosoma congolense (Osaer et al., 1999) infections, can adversely affect onset of puberty and age at first lambing by depressing weight gain of affected animals. Administration of a long-acting nematocide anthelmintic, which effectively protected treated ewe-lambs for up to 85 days post-ram introduction, allowed treated animals to exhibit their full reproductive potential during that time . Treated ewe-lambs showed earlier reproductive activity, as expressed by short 'interval to first mating after ram introduction' and increased 'cycling rate'; this resulted in significantly younger 'age at first mating' . Anthelmintic-treated ewe-lambs reached heavier bodyweight, which is a determinant for puberty in sheep ; thus, they were mated and conceived earlier than untreated controls. There are also similar findings in cattle, showing that nematode-infected heifers reach puberty with a delay compared to uninfected animals (Díaz-Torga et al., 2001) .  Mating  Genital myiosis caused by various dipteran insects, can lead to vulvar oedema and subcutaneous fistulae around the vulva in ewes and to difficult/partial exteriorising of penis and markedly thickened prepuce with subcutaneous fistulae along the tissue in rams (Fragkou et al., 2013) . These lesions can impede mating. Development of myiosis lesions takes place during the summer months (Wall, 2012) . At para-Mediterranean areas and other locations of similar (north hemisphere) or of respective (south hemisphere) geographical latitude, summer months coincide with the sheep reproductive season; at more northern (north hemisphere) or more southern (south hemisphere) latitudes, they precede that period (Abecia et al., 2011 (Abecia et al., , 2012 .Tick predilection for the genital organs (vulvar mucosa, scrotum) of sheep has been reported (Fourie and Kok, 1995; Mbuh et al., 2008) and may be responsible for local nuisance and/or inflammatory reaction, which may also adversely affect mating. One may also suggest that ectoparasitic infections with intense pruritus (e.g., heavy lice infestation, mange) could lead to reduced mating activity of rams, as these animals would be busy scratching rather than being sexually active. Ridler et al. (2012) have proposed that parasitic diseases can affect the scrotal circumference of rams and that parasite control is important for keeping rams sound for breeding. Scrotal circumference in rams has been associated with their reproductive performance (Kafi et al., 2004; Gouletsou and Fthenakis, 2010) . However, Gaglio et al. (2010) have not identified a significant effect of gastrointestinal trichostrongylid infection to semen parametres in rams. (Rhodes, 1975 (Rhodes, , 1976 has presented evidence that extensive chorioptic mange in the scrotum of rams led to reduced quality of their semen, due to seminal degeneration, as a consequence of long-standing increased intra-scrotal temperature due to the inflammation; semen quality was restored after cure of the skin lesions. Lopes et al. (2009) have identified that Toxoplasma gondii-infected rams have produced smaller volumes of ejaculate than healthy animals, whilst Sangare et al. (2010) have reported azoospermia in Tr. congolense-infected rams. Finally, Sarasa et al. (2011) have reported that sarcoptic mange can cause reduction of the testicular mass in Capra pyrenaica (a wild small ruminant); these findings may have implications for sheep, in which species sarcoptic mange is a significant health problem (Doukas et al., 2007) .  Testicular function  Moreover, parasitic agents may be transmitted through the semen of rams. T. gondii shedding has been identified in the semen of rams (De Moraes et al., 2010a,b) and the possibility for transmission of the parasite to ewes during mating has been described (De Moraes et al., 2010a,b) depending on the tachyzoite content of semen. In a recent study, DNA of Neospora caninum was detected in the semen of experimentally infected rams (Syed-Hussain et al., 2013) , although none of the ewes mated with those rams developed the disease.No relevant studies are available regarding Besnoitia infection of rams. Nevertheless, experimental work performed in bucks has indicated that Besnoitia caprae can affect their genital system, with cysts of the protozoon identified in the testicular parenchyma and the scrotum (Oryan et al., 2011) . Other clinical studies have indicated that Besnoitia besnoiti can affect the testicular parenchyma and scrotum of bulls (Sekoni et al., 1992; Dubey et al., 2013) , leading to reduced libido and suboptimal semen quality, although in subsequent studies the protozoon could not be detected in the semen of affected bulls (Esteban-Gil et al., 2014) .In general, there is still little published evidence to corroborate an adverse association between parasitism and testicular function (which is reflected in semen quality), although available results point out to that direction. Possibly, parasitic infections can directly affect semen quality of rams and, hence, influence conception rates in a flock. Alternatively, changes in testicular function can lead to reduced production of testosterone, which is a determinant of a ram's sexual behaviour and social ranking within a flock (Parkinson, 1996) ; this may lead to changes in social interactions and behaviours during mating period. All the above can affect conception rates in a flock, especially if the ram:ewe ratio is at the lower acceptable level or if reproductive management techniques are applied in the flock. This is an area where further work will elucidate mechanisms and potential interactions between parasitism and reproduction.  Number of ovulations and conception  The period immediately before and around conception is a potentially vulnerable period. During that period, adverse developmental origin of the foetus might initiate, as the result of reduced availability of nutrients to the female animal (Fleming et al., 2012) . The significance of increased energy available to ewes in the pre-conception period has been recognised for a long time (Clark, 1934; Walkden-Brown et al., 1999; Dobson et al., 2012) . Increased energy is provided to ewes by means of modifying the nutritional regime in the period before ewes would be put with rams for mating. At the start of the mating season, ewes should have a body-condition score of '3' to '3.5' on the five-point scale (Lovatt, 2010) . 'Flushing' consists of administration of an additional quantity of concentrate feed mixture, on top of the ration administered to cover maintenance requirements of the animals and should commence at least 35 days before start of the mating period; that interval is equivalent to the length of two full oestrous cycles of sheep. In animals with appropriate body-condition score, this increased energy feeding aims to producing higher ovulation numbers, leading to greater number of lambs born per ewe. In animals at lower body condition score, there is a benefit to other reproductive parametres (e.g., earlier start of the annual reproductive activity, improved cycling and lambing rate), but no significant improvement in their fecundity (Heasman et al., 1998; Fthenakis et al., 2012) .The converse is also true. Poor body condition of ewes is associated with reduced fertility, characterised by delayed oestrus development and reduced 'cycling rate' in a flock. Ovulation rates decrease as body condition score of the animals deteriorates (Dobson et al., 2012) , whilst embryo mortality at the early stages of pregnancy is higher in undernourished animals (Gunn and Doney, 1975) . In general, decreased energy availability around the peri-conceptional period, depresses reproductive performance of extensively (Hill Farming Research Organisation, 1979) or intensively (Orskov, 1982) managed sheep and leads to reduced cyclic activity, reduced ovulation rates and suboptimal ova survival, as well as increased risk of early embryonic deaths (Gunn, 1967) . Decreased energy availability at the post-conception period leads to compensatory changes in the gravid uterus later in pregnancy, e.g., increased vascular density of the placentomes (Zhu et al., 2007) , which in turn can lead to higher risk of foetal infection with parasitic abortifacient agents (Section 6.1), especially in multiple pregnancies; health of the lamb(s) after birth is also adversely affected (Fleming et al., 2012) .Lambs from multiple parities were found to be more heavily infected with trichostrongylids than lambs from single parities (Hayward et al., 2010) . Twin foetuses develop a between-them competition for nutrients, are enveloped by a smaller placenta than single foetuses and live in a restricted physical space . The findings of Hayward et al. (2010) are in line with the 'Developmental Origins of Health and Disease' concept (formerly known as foetal programming or the Barker hypothesis), which implicates early in utero development and the maternal environment experienced during that period as being of significance to development of disease in adulthood (Fleming et al., 2012) .The most significant energy-drain of clinically healthy sheep is parasitism by gastrointestinal helminths. The effects of these parasites in reducing energy availability for their hosts have been well documented (Coop and Kyriazakis, 1999) . These authors have proposed that gastrointestinal nematodes can reduce nutrient availability to the host, through a reduction in voluntary feed intake and/or a reduction in the efficiency of absorbed nutrients; the relative contribution of each of these two mechanisms depend on the species of parasite and its location in the gastrointestinal tract (Coop and Kyriazakis, 1999) . With regard to trematode infections, reduced feed conversion efficiency, present even in low burden infections (Hawkins and Morris, 1978) , as well as depressed appetite and feed intake, also occurring in these helminthoses (Taylor et al., 2007; Rojo-Vázquez et al., 2012) , contribute to decreased energy availability for affected sheep.It thus becomes evident that parasitism by the above helminths may affect reproductive efficiency in ewes during the peri-conception period, mostly through the decreased energy availability for the animals. The precise adverse effects can vary depending on the level of parasitism and the general condition of the animal. It is also noteworthy that reduced feed intake occurring in such cases, would reduce the benefits of supplementation with high-energy feed before mating ('flushing'), as animals would not benefit from all energy provided.Similar results have been published in cases of T. congolense infection (Osaer et al., 1998) . Affected animals showed lower rates of conception and pregnancy and had lower concentrations of progesterone, which is a major factor in establishment of pregnancy, with a function to synchronise development of the maternal endometrium with intrauterine arrival of the embryo (Wilmut and Sales, 1981; Lawson and Cahill, 1983) . As an association between luteal phase progesterone blood concentrations and embryo survival has been suggested (Noakes, 1996) , perhaps the reduced progesterone levels may be responsible for the conception problems in affected ewes. Fthenakis et al. (2001) reported that Sarcoptes scabieiinfested ewes had fewer ovulations than uninfested animals and attributed that to nutrient availability at the pre-conception period. Nevertheless, when progesterone and equine chorionic gonadotrophin were administered exogenously, no differences were evident between infested and healthy animals. This indirectly suggests reduced hormone concentrations in the parasitised animals during the peri-conceptional period, which lends further support to the idea of sarcoptic mange influencing embryo implantation and survival.In sheep, there are no reports directly associating quality of female gametes (ova) with parasitism. Nevertheless, some relevant results have been published in cattle. Tritrichomonas foetus has been reported to damage oocytes (Benchimol et al., 2007) . Also, N. caninum has been detected in bovine follicles during assisted reproduction manipulations (Silva et al., 2012) , as well as in bovine foetuses (Marques et al., 2011) , although there are reports suggesting that embryo transfer is a safe method to avoid vertical transmission of these protozoon (Landmann et al., 2002; Moskwa et al., 2008) . These implications should be borne in mind, as assisted reproductive technologies for sheep are developing and being applied in larger numbers of animals (Amiridis and Cseh, 2012) .In view of the above, one should consider the strategic administration of anthelmintic drugs before the start of the mating period, with a view to improve reproductive efficiency. In fact, Mavrogianni et al. (2011) have reported that ewes given a broad-spectrum long-acting anthelmintic before the start of the mating period had a higher 'cycling rate' reflecting better functionality of the genital system of the treated animals and higher 'total lambs born per ewe' and 'liveborn lambs per ewe' indicating increased number of ovulations during the peri-conceptional period. In dairytype production systems, anthelmintic administration at the pre-conception period (which coincides with the end of a lactation period) would also contribute to maintaining a longer persistency of lactation (another energy-dependent function), although drug withdrawal periods (Athanasiou et al., 2009 ) should be taken into account when designing strategic treatments. Finally, anthelmintic administration before the mating season has the added advantage of avoiding the inadverted administration of albendazole or netobimin, broad-spectrum anthelmintics with confirmed embryotoxic properties (Delatour et al., 1981; Navarro et al., 1998) , to ewes at the first stage of pregnancy.As sheep have a seasonal pattern of reproductive activity, depending on the geographical latitude, the pre-mating period would also differ according to location. Hence, administration of anthelmintics at that period would have differing effects from a parasitological viewpoint, resulting from the difference in season. This should be taken into account when strategic treatments are carried out at the pre-mating period. Furthermore, one should have in mind the possibility of promoting anthelmintic resistance that way and should consider an appropriate cost-benefit analysis.One should always take into account that in para-Mediterranean areas and locations of similar latitude (in the north hemisphere), as well as in locations of respective latitude in the south hemisphere, reproductive activity of sheep would start at the beginning of the summer (hence, anthelmintic administration should be planned for late spring). Moreover, in more northern (north hemisphere) or more southern (south hemisphere) areas, reproductive activity of sheep would start in the autumn (hence, anthelmintic administration should be planned for late summer).  Foetopathic effects of protozoa  Foetopathies and abortions are significant problems in pregnant ewes and major sources of financial losses in sheep flocks (Menzies, 2012) . Various protozoa can cause abortion in ewes.The principal problem by parasites in pregnant ewes is toxoplasmosis, caused by the intracellular protozoon T. gondii, which is a confirmed abortifacient agent (Buxton and Rodger, 2007) . Ewes often become infected through consumption of oocyst-contaminated concentrate feed, given to the animals as an energy-supplement (Buxton and Rodger, 2007) . If infection takes place before the 61st-80th day of gestation, embryonic death occurs, followed by absorption or expulsion of small embryos, rarely being noticed. If infection takes place later, up to the 110th-115th day of gestation, then abortion takes place. Finally, if infection takes place after that, congenitally infected lambs are born. In embryos, the organism causes coagulative necrosis in the placental cotyledons, as well as microglial foci, representing an immune response (Buxton and Rodger, 2007) . Toxoplasmosis has been well-studied around the world, with many scientific references describing all aspects of the disease (Buxton and Rodger, 2007; Dubey, 2009) .Neosporosis, caused by the protozoon N. caninum, is an emerging reproductive problem in ewes; many facets of the disease still remain unclear (Dubey and Schares, 2011) . In the initial literature, the infection had not been always associated with abortion (Otter et al., 1997; Chanton-Greutmann et al., 2002) , despite evidence showing the abortifacient role of the organism in experimental infections (Buxton et al., , 2001 . Progressively, however, reports from various parts of the world have associated the parasite with abortion in ewes (Masala et al., 2007; Spilovská et al., 2009; Howe et al., 2012; Moreno et al., 2012) , although frequency and clinical significance of the problem require further elucidation (Dubey and Schares, 2011) . The organism establishes itself in the maternal caruncular septum, before crossing to the foetal placental villi. A direct foetopathic effect of the organism has been described to be the cause of abortion (Innes, 2007; Gibney et al., 2008) , although further studies are necessary to fully clarify the pathogenesis of the infection.Other protozoa that have been reported with an abortifacient role, include Sarcocystis ovicanis (S. tenella), S. arieticanis, Trypanosoma brucei subsp. brucei, T. congolense, T. vivax and Theileria spp. (Buxton, 1998; Heckeroth and Tenter, 1998; Bawa et al., 2000; Nagore et al., 2004; Batista et al., 2009 ).  Peri-parturient rise in faecal parasitic output: Pre-partum period  The relaxation of acquired immunity to parasites around lambing and its consequences have been well documented (Armour, 1980; Gibbs, 1986; Barger, 1993) . This is manifested with a rise in faecal parasitic output and had initially, for nematode infections, been associated with increased prolactin concentrations. Fleming, 1993 Fleming, , 1996 investigated the potential role of prolactin and prostaglandin F 2␣ (two hormones, the concentrations of which increase at the end of pregnancy); they found that total egg production by Haemonchus contortus in infected sheep increased after administration of prolactin, but not after 'administration of prostaglandin F 2␣ , to those animals.Prolactin is a peptide hormone, responsible for initiating and sustaining lactation in ewes (Castro et al., 2011) . It acts in a cytokine-like manner and as an important regulator of the immune system (Rovensky et al., 1991) . Blood concentrations of prolactin in pregnant ewes start to increase from the 115th-135th day of gestation (Banchero et al., 2006) . Beasley et al. (2010a,b) reported that, in ewes experimentally infected with Trichostrongylus colubriformis, the rise in faecal egg counts at the end of pregnancy had been preceded by a decrease in the immunological competence of the ewes; this was shown by reduced numbers of circulating eosinophils and by decreased total antibody and IgG 1 titres. The changes coincided with increased prolactin concentrations at the end of pregnancy, but, nevertheless, the authors considered that they were unrelated to hormonal effects; this confirmed a similar earlier hypothesis by Coop et al. (1990) . As significant differences have been reported in blood concentrations of prolactin according to season (Gomez Brunet and Lopez Sebastian, 1991) , the peri-parturient rise in faecal parasitic output should have differed in accord with time of the year. According to Coop and Kyriazakis (1999) , this relaxation of immunity and the ensuing increase in faecal egg counts appear to have a nutrition-based background. Under the conditions of high metabolic demand, which occur at the end of pregnancy, susceptibility of ewes to gastrointestinal parasites is increased (Kahn et al., 2003) . Finally, Coop and Kyriazakis (1999) proposed a nutritional, rather than an endocrinological, involvement in the relaxation of immunity during that period and presented the following arguments: (a) grade of immunity expression in pregnant ewes is consistent with the reproductive effort, i.e., the number of foetuses borne, (b) termination of pregnancy leads to abrupt restoration of immunity and (c) nutritional management of pregnant ewes can alter the time of first observation of the relaxation. Beasley et al. (2012) reported that feeding ewes a low quality diet resulted in a peri-parturient rise in faecal parasitic output starting 24 days before lambing and increasing substantially thereafter, whilst in ewes fed a high quality diet there was only a short rise of small magnitude; these findings lend further support to the above theory.A peri-parturient increase of oocyst/cyst output has also been recorded in Cryptosporidium (Xiao et al., 1994; Ortega-Mora et al., 1999) and Giardia (Xiao et al., 1994) infections of pregnant ewes. In both cases, the authors recorded an increase of oocyst/cyst numbers in faeces of pregnant ewes, as well as an increase in the number of ewes, which excreted oocysts/cysts in their faeces.Perhaps, a combination of all above factors may determine the whole process. The parasites can also play a role in increasing the metabolic pressure in pregnant ewes. The increased parasitic output during the pre-partum period has significant consequences for the epidemiology of the respective diseases. Lambs are born in a contaminated environment and, thus, are exposed to the infective forms of the various parasites at a very young age.  Metabolic problems caused by parasitic infections  In sheep, pregnancy is a metabolically demanding period. During the first 100 days of pregnancy, there is a slow foetal growth (Blanchart and Sauvant, 1974; Economides and Louca, 1981) ; during the second month of pregnancy, when foetal attachment has been established and placental growth has been completed, foetus(es) can acquire up to 15-25% of their future birth bodyweight; finally, at the last stage of pregnancy, the ovine foetus(es) can develop rapidly, to acquire up to 75-80% of their future birth bodyweight . Hence, energy requirements of pregnant ewes increase, as the end of pregnancy is approaching. In the final month of gestation, protein requirements of pregnant ewes also increase, due to foetal requirements and the need to prepare colostrum in the mammary glands . The situation may be aggravated in cases of heavy parasitic infections, as parasites increase the energy requirements of their hosts (Coop et al., 1977; Dakkak, 1990) , as well as protein synthesis by the host, and consequently protein requirements, due to tissue invasion and damage (Solomons, 1993) .Recently, Papadopoulos et al. (2013) have shown that trematode infections (Fasciola hepatica and Dicrocoelium dendriticum) in pregnant adult ewes led to increased ␤hydroxybutyrate concentrations in blood, thus indicating a potential association between trematode infections and pregnancy toxaemia. The authors attributed that on the direct effects that trematodes exert on the liver of affected sheep, as well as on the general energy drain effects of parasitism on the pregnant animals; they suggested that in flocks where many risk factors for pregnancy toxaemia would accumulate (e.g., suboptimal feeding), synergistic effect of those, coupled with trematode infection, could lead to clinical cases of pregnancy toxaemia. Valderrábano et al. (2006) took the opposite approach and reported that increased feeding allowance during pregnancy resulted in improved response of pregnant sheep against H. contortus infection. The findings support the idea that response of pregnant ewes to parasitic infections during pregnancy may be enhanced by increased nutrition planes in the earlier stages (Valderrabano and Uriarte, 2003) .Potential metabolic problems caused by parasitic infections are expressed, ultimately, in the birth bodyweight of lambs born. Osaer et al. (1999) have reported that lambs born from T. congolense-infected ewes were of smaller bodyweight than those born from healthy animals. Moreover, Gatongi et al. (1997) and Fthenakis et al. (2005) have administered a nematocidal treatment to ewes at the end of pregnancy and found that birthweight of lambs from treated ewes was higher than that of lambs from untreated animals.  Foetopathic effects of antiparasitic drugs  Albendazole and the respective pro-benzimidazole, netobimin, have a confirmed teratogenic effect to sheep embryos, causing skeletal, renal and/or vascular malformations (Navarro et al., 1998) , when administered to ewes during the first stage of gestation. Active metabolites of these drugs can cross the placenta and reach the foetal blood circulation (Capece et al., 2002) . Often, the affected foetuses are absorbed or expelled, so ewes will be seen as barren animals at the end of the lambing season. Consequently, if there is a need for administration of these drugs, they should be given before start of the mating period, as pre-conception administration of the drug does not appear to cause a foetopathic effect during the subsequent pregnancy (Teruel et al., 2011) . Otherwise, anthelmintic drugs with no foetopathic effects must be used. The precaution should extend to later stages of the breeding season, if rams remain with ewes for a long period of time, as there is always the possibility for some ewes to have been mated later in the season .Levamisole has also been reported to potentially cause abortion if administered in late pregnancy (Braun, 1997) , hence, it should better be avoided at that period.  Lambing  Tissue lesions caused by genital myiosis may result to development of connective tissue in the vaginal and vulvar regions; these lesions can cause dystocia at lambing, due to possible foetomaternal disproportion, as a result of the lesions narrowing the birth canal (Arthur and Bee, 1996) . Also, presence of connective tissue can lead to difficulties in dilatation of the birth canal, which may also lead to dystocia. Dystocia may also occur in cases of births of malformed embryos, formed consequently to albendazole/netobimin administration at the first stage of pregnancy (Section 6.4). Finally, Leontides et al. (2000) have postulated that D. dendriticum-infection may act as a risk factor for retention of foetal membranes in ewes during the subsequent lambing; they attributed the effect to the reduced energy availability of parasitised ewes, which may affect leucocyte function of ewes, a determinant of placental retention (Azawi, 2008) , that way potentially associating the parasitic infection with the increased incidence of the reproductive disorder in ewes.  Lactation  8.1. Peri-parturient rise in faecal parasitic output: Post-partum periodThe increase in faecal parasitic output ('peri-parturient egg rise') continues after lambing and contributes to lambs for acquiring the infective forms of the various parasites at a young age. Beasley et al. (2012) found that increased parasitic output from infected ewes was evident for up to 1.5 months after lambing, but, again, suggested that an association with endocrinological factors was unlikely (bar, possibly, a potential role for cortisol), concluding that some other factor(s) would be contributing to the relaxation of immunity to nematodes and the consequent increase in faecal parasitic output during the post-partum period (Beasley et al., 2012) . Suarez et al. (2009) and Cruz-Rojo et al. (2012) have documented that gastrointestinal nematode parasitism can cause 10-15% reduction in milk yield of affected ewes, as well as shorter persistency of lactation. Anthelmintic treatment has also been found to increase milk production (Rinaldi et al., 2007) . More specifically, Fthenakis et al. (2005) and Cringoli et al. (2009) have reported that administration of an anthelmintic with a long persistent activity at the final stage of pregnancy, resulted in a significant (up to 40%) increase in total milk production throughout the subsequent lactation period. Finally, Fthenakis et al. (2000) have identified a lower milk production in ewes with sarcoptic mange: up to 18% compared to healthy animals.  Milk yield and milk composition  The situation regarding potential effects on milk composition is not clear. Cruz-Rojo et al. (2012) have described that milk from ewes with gastrointestinal nematode parasitism had lower fat and total protein content during the last stage of lactation, but Sechi et al. (2010) have not found a significant effect of parasitism on milk composition.It is clear that parasitism leads to reduction in milk production of affected animals. The above studies have been carried out in dairy breeds, with a view to estimate milk production and financial effects of parasitism for dairy farmers. Results of direct studies of potential milk yield reduction due to parasitism, in the growth of lambs of the affected ewes are not available and can only inferred from the above reports. Reduced milk yield of ewes leads to suboptimal growth rate of lambs (Fthenakis and Jones, 1990) and, during the neonatal period, even to increased death rate of lambs (Dwyer, 2008; Brozos et al., 2011) . In this context, it is noteworthy the report by Juste Jordán and García Pérez (1991) , who found that adverse effects of parasitism in milk yield were more pronounced at the final stage of lactation, when, however, there is little dependence of lambs on maternal milk, as they consume solid feed. The nutritive value of milk is also dependent upon its composition. Nevertheless, a variety of factors can influence milk composition (e.g., nutrition, genetics, stage of lactation, mammary health), which may be difficult to control in order to test potential adverse effects of parasitism; that may explain the unclear results among the respective studies.  Mastitis  The major defence mechanism against bacteria invading into the mammary gland is phagocytosis (Craven and Williams, 1985) . The process is regulated through a variety of factors, among them energy resources of the host (Greenberg and Grinstein, 2002; Stuart and Ezekowitz, 2005) , which may indicate a potential adverse role for parasites.In two recent publications, Mavrogianni et al. (2012 Mavrogianni et al. ( , 2014 have shown the effects of gastrointestinal parasitic infections to development of mastitis in ewes. In a field study, trematode infections (F. hepatica and D. dendriticum) in lactating multiparous ewes have led to increased incidence of clinical or subclinical mastitis during the first two weeks post-partum (Mavrogianni et al., 2014) . In an experimental study, deposition of Mannheimia haemolytica into the teat duct of trichostrongylid-infected ewes resulted to development of clinical mastitis, whilst healthy controls developed only subclinical disease after challenge .The above studies were the first to confirm that parasitic infections predispose ewes to mastitis, both diseases being significant health and welfare problems in sheep flocks. It is interesting to note that in one of these studies (Mavrogianni et al., 2014) , the association between trematode infection and mastitis was shown in the immediately post-partum period, when relaxation of immunity (Sections 6.2 and 8.1) would be present. In the other one of the above papers , the authors have presented evidence of impaired local defence mechanisms in the mammary glands of parasitised ewes, which might explain pathways for the association observed.  Newborn lambs  During infections with the various abortifacient parasitic agents, foetuses may survive depending upon their age at infection (Section 6.1). In such cases, weak lambs, usually congenitally infected with the respective agent, may be born. Such lambs may die soon after birth, from attacks of predators or from hypothermia, as often they are unable to stand up on time, suck and respond to external stimuli (Wilsmore, 1984) .A significant and well documented (De Graaf et al., 1999; Fayer, 2004; Taylor et al., 2007; Shahiduzzaman and Daugschies, 2013) health problem in newborn and young lambs is cryptosporidiosis. The disease is an infectious enteritis that causes high morbidity and mortality of affected animals. It is caused by the enteric protozoa Cryptosporidium spp., which can affect newborns alone or in mixed infection with Escherichia coli or viruses affecting the intestinal tract (e.g., Rotavirus, Coronavirus) (Chatzopoulos et al., 2013) . Cryptosporidium spp. are located at the microvilli in the intestine of affected lambs and impair intestinal function. The disease causes suboptimal growth rate and often death of affected animals, leading to heavy economic losses in the sheep industry. Lambs which survive infection at a young age, remain asymptomatic carriers and shed oocysts, contributing to increased environmental contamination and infection of newborn lambs.  Growing pre-weaned lambs  Giardia spp. is an intestinal protozoon affecting lambs at the end of the neonatal period (O'Handley and Olson, 2006) . Infection is often asymptomatic, although it can cause diarrhoea, which becomes severe and life-threatening in cases of co-infection with other enteric pathogens (Andrew Thompson et al., 2008) . Specific works in lambs have not been reported. In calves, infection with Giardia duodenalis can lead to loss of the epithelial barrier function, villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia in the small intestine, changes which may result in clinical disease usually characterised by intermittent diarrhoea (Ruest et al., 1997) . In any case, the lesions would cause malabsorption, leading to suboptimal weight gain, reduced feed-efficiency and ill-thriftiness of the affected animals (Olson et al., 1995; Buret, 2007; Sweeny et al., 2012) . In general, the significance of this infection has not yet been fully elucidated and further studies are needed.Eimeria spp. are well-described enteric protozoa (Taylor et al., 2007; Andrews, 2011; Taylor, 2012) , which can affect growing lambs from the age of 20 days onwards, causing coccidiosis. Up to 11 different species have been reported to affect lambs; E. crandallis and E. ovinoidalis are considered to be the most pathogenic, perhaps because they cause extensive damage in both the small and the large intestine. Infections usually remain inapparent, although affected lambs may not be thriving as expected. Watery, haemorrhagic diarrhoea can occur and may result to death, if the infection is not properly managed.The onset of intense infection of lambs with gastrointestinal helminths (tapeworms and nematodes) coincides with the start of consumption of solid feed by these animals, specifically grazing. Tapeworms (Moniezia spp., Avitellina spp., Stilesia spp., Thysaniezia spp.) are regarded of little pathogenic significance, only in heavy infections causing suboptimal growth rate and possibly clinical signs (Taylor et al., 2007) .The effects of gastrointestinal nematode parasitism on the growth of unweaned lambs have been well documented. These parasites are of importance in mutton-type production systems, where lambs remain with their dams for over 100 days of age (Sargison, 2009) . In contrast to that, in dairy-type production systems, lambs are weaned at a younger age (Gelasakis et al., 2010) and, usually, are taken for slaughter; hence, chances for building up a significant production-limiting parasitic burden are minimal. Gastrointestinal nematode infections cause significant growth retardation or delay in age of slaughter, which have been documented repeatedly in the older to the more recent scientific literature (Coop et al., 1984; Sweeny et al., 2012) . The significant financial losses associated with the growth retardation of unweaned lambs have led to the need for frequent anthelmintic treatments in these animals, which, in turn, have led to development of widespread anthelmintic resistance in sheep flocks around the world Torres-Acosta et al., 2012) . Currently, many strategies for anthelmintic treatment of lambs in mutton-type production systems have been advocated, with emphasis given to strategic administration of the drugs (Sargison, 2011 (Sargison, , 2012 .  Concluding remarks  The review has covered many aspects of interaction between parasitic infections and reproduction in sheep. In the majority of cases, parasitic infections lead to reduced reproductive efficiency, although there are a few cases where the reproductive stage of the animal influences the parasitic infection. Further collaboration of parasitologists with obstetricians, endocrinologists and immunologists will contribute to deeper investigations into these topics and the elucidation of potential relationships, in order to improve health, welfare and production of sheep.  								
19144362	Assessment of ambulance dispatch data for surveillance of influenza-like illness in Melbourne, Australia	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7111682/	Summary Objectives Ambulance dispatch data are collated electronically in many jurisdictions and have a wide reach into the community. They may therefore be useful for syndromic surveillance and early recognition of emerging infectious diseases. This study assessed whether ambulance dispatch data are suitable for influenza surveillance. Study design Comparison of a time series of ambulance dispatch data from Melbourne, Australia for the years 1997–2005 with locum service and general practice (GP) sentinel surveillance data for influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods All data were aggregated into 1-week periods, corresponding to the data collection period used in the GP sentinel surveillance system, which was used as the reference system. Rates of ambulance dispatches classified to respiratory or breathing problems per 1000 total dispatches were compared with rates of callouts for flu or influenza per 1000 locum calls, and rates of ILI per 1000 patients from the sentinel GPs. Signals from the ambulance data were generated using the log likelihood ratio CUSUM, a method of continuous monitoring suitable for surveillance. Results The ambulance dispatch data displayed seasonal trends that were similar to those observed in locum service surveillance and GP sentinel systems, and identified the years with higher-than-expected seasonal ILI activity (1998 and 2003) and the epidemic year (1997). However, there was a high baseline rate of ambulance calls classified to respiratory or breathing problems (90–100 per 1000 calls) in months where there was minimal influenza activity. Conclusion Ambulance dispatch data have potential for syndromic surveillance, but because of the high background noise are not definitive and would need to be calibrated to suit particular local circumstances.	Introduction  Influenza viruses circulate in temperate climates from early autumn to late spring, and in tropical climates throughout the year with unpredictable peaks, usually occurring during the wet season and cooler months. Routine surveillance for influenza and influenzalike illness (ILI) can provide estimates of the relative severity of influenza seasons, and can also provide clinical specimens from which influenza viruses can be detected. This allows comparison of circulating influenza strains with vaccine strains in the current influenza season, and may provide potential vaccine strains for future seasons.Routine ILI surveillance is conducted in most industrialized countries and consists of several elements. 1 These include sentinel surveillance in general practices (GPs), 2 monitoring ILI presentations to hospital emergency departments, 3 monitoring hospital admissions and deaths due to influenza and pneumonia, and school and workplace absenteeism. 4 In Victoria, Australia, a medical locum service, the Melbourne Medical Locum Service (MMLS), is also used to monitor ILI. 5 Most countries also monitor laboratory confirmed influenza. 6 It has been shown previously that all clinical data sources, specifically GP sentinel surveillance, locum service surveillance, and hospital admissions and emergency department presentations for laboratory confirmed or clinically diagnosed influenza, give a similar picture of the influenza season. 7 Most surveillance systems use a standardized case definition for ILI 8 and describe circulating influenza activity by threshold level. ILI GP sentinel surveillance, with laboratory support, has been conducted in Melbourne, Australia since 1998 using an ILI case definition of fever (or feverishness), cough and fatigue (or malaise). 9 Numeric thresholds, based on a comparison of sentinel ILI surveillance with hospital admissions for laboratory confirmed or clinically diagnosed influenza, have been developed that range from normal seasonal activity through to higher-than-expected seasonal activity and epidemic activity. 10 The thresholds were developed retrospectively and have been applied prospectively.Recent reports have suggested that ambulance dispatch data may be able to provide an alternative ILI surveillance system. 11, 12 Ambulance dispatch data are collated electronically in many jurisdictions and have a wide reach into the community. The ambulance service is frequently the first point of call for the seriously ill person. In this study, it was hypothesized that ambulance dispatch data could provide an alternative ILI surveillance system in Melbourne, Australia. This was assessed by determining whether ambulance dispatch data displayed seasonal trends similar to those observed in existing ILI surveillance systems, and whether increased signalling from ambulance dispatch data corresponded with previously defined seasonal thresholds established for GP sentinel surveillance.  Data sources  Ambulance dispatch data were compared with locum service and GP sentinel surveillance data. The analyses were confined to data from Melbourne because the locum service is based there. Melbourne is the capital city of the Australian state of Victoria and has a population of approximately 3.8 million people. Data from ambulance dispatch, the locum service, and GP sentinel sites are all community based. Ambulance and locum service data are available for the whole year, while GP sentinel data are only collected from May to September; the typical influenza season in the southern hemisphere. Ambulance and GP sentinel data were available for the 9-year period 1997-2005, whereas the locum service data were only available for the 4-year period 2002-2005.  Ambulance dispatch data  All ambulance dispatch calls are classified by the dispatcher into one of 33 categories based on the Medical Priority Dispatch System. 13 Classifications are broad and include abdominal pain, cardiac arrest, assault, headache and overdose. The dispatcher enters each call and its classification (based on specified query algorithms) immediately into the computerized dispatch system, which then recommends an appropriate resource based on acuity. Calls classified to respiratory or breathing problems (Card 6 in the Medical Patient Dispatch System) were evaluated, and these are referred to as 'respiratory dispatch' calls in this article.  GP sentinel surveillance data  GP sentinel surveillance, operational in Victoria during the influenza season (May-September), reports on the number of patients fulfilling the Australian nationally agreed ILI case definition of cough, fever and fatigue, in addition to the total number of patients seen each week. Respiratory specimens taken from a proportion of cases permit diagnosis of laboratory confirmed influenza or other respiratory viruses. 2, 5 Weekly data are updated fortnightly on the Internet. 2  Locum service data  The MMLS is a deputizing, out-of-hours service for GPs that attends to patients in their homes within a 35-km radius of the Melbourne metropolitan area. Demographic and clinical information from patients seen by doctors from the MMLS are routinely entered into a database within 24 h of a consultation. A final diagnosis with free text including either the term 'flu' or 'influenza' is extracted from this database to conduct ILI surveillance.  Statistical analysis  All data were aggregated into 1-week periods, corresponding to the data collection period used by the paper-based, GP sentinel surveillance system, which was used as the reference system. This is the only system for which thresholds have been developed. Ambulance data were recorded as respiratory dispatches per 1000 total ambulance dispatches, GP sentinel rates were recorded as ILI cases per 1000 patients, and locum service data were recorded as ILI callouts per 1000 calls.CUSUM (cumulative summation) was developed for industrial quality control in the 1950s, 14 has much in common with exploratory data analysis, 15 and is being used more frequently for surveillance. 16 To generate signals for the ambulance data, the log likelihood ratio (LLR) form of the CUSUM was used, which is optimal, in a statistical sense, for detecting abrupt shifts from the baseline. 17 For a binomial process (i.e. monitoring weekly proportions), the LLR CUSUM for the ith week is 18 :where:h is a threshold where the process is set to signal (see later); ando X i is the number of respiratory dispatches in the ith week o n i is the total number of dispatches in the ith week o Y i is the seasonally adjusted, baseline ILI dispatch rate for the ith week (i.e. the in-control ILI dispatch rate). This was estimated using data from 2 years of normal seasonal activity identified in the GP sentinel surveillance system (2004 and 2005). 10 The Holt-Winters seasonal additive procedure 19 was used to smooth weekly data, which was then averaged across the 2 years and within each month to obtain estimates of Y i for each month, January-December (Table 1) . o OR is the odds ratio for a pre-specified increase in the ILI dispatch rate over baseline, which was considered to indicate higher-than-expected seasonal activity. This is like the minimum clinically important difference which must be pre-specified when designing a clinical trial. For this study, an OR of 1.22 was pre-specified, which corresponds to an increase of 20% over the seasonally adjusted, baseline ILI dispatch rate (Y i ).The performance of the LLR CUSUM is based on the concept of run length because the familiar Type 1 and Type 2 error rates associated with hypothesis tests are difficult to interpret. With sequential monitoring, the Type 1 error rate is not constant but increases with the length of the monitoring period. The probability of eventually signalling an alarm is 1.0 for all sequential tests, so that the Type 1 error rate will eventually be 100% and the Type 2 error rate will eventually be 0%. 20 In the context of this study, the run length is the number of weeks until a signal; ideally, this should be large when there is normal seasonal activity (i.e. low false-alarm rate) and small when there is higher-than-expected seasonal activity (i.e. high power). Average run lengths for different values of h can be estimated using simulations, Markov chains or, in certain circumstances, by approximating formulae. 21 Simulations were used for this study. Briefly, data sets of 10,000 weeks (under the assumptions of normal seasonal activity or 20% higher) were specified and iterated 10,000 times to obtain estimates of the average (median) run length to true and false alarms.At present, there is no agreed convention to guide the selection of h (and the resultant average run lengths), in contrast to the somewhat arbitrary convention of P ¼ 0.05 which is commonly used in hypothesis testing. For this study, h was set at 10 because this gave an average run length to a true alarm of 4 weeks, and an average run length to a false alarm of approximately 1000 weeks. It was possible to select the relatively large value of h ¼ 10 and still obtain a short average run length to a true alarm because the number of ambulance dispatches per week was large (mean 4253; see Results section).The starting value for the CUSUM was set at h/2 to reflect the uncertainty, before looking at the data, regarding whether or not it was a period of higher-than-expected activity. Similarly, after a signal, the CUSUM was reset to h/2 because there was no way of knowing whether the higher-than-expected proportions had returned to baseline values. This is different from the use of CUSUM in industry, where after a signal, the machine (say) is recalibrated and known to be 'in control' and therefore monitoring restarts at h ¼ 0. 18 The use of CUSUM in this paper corresponds with Phase 1 of calibration used for quality control in the industrial context, which is largely descriptive and involves setting the parameters of the systems such as estimating seasonally adjusted, baseline (in-control) values (Y i ) and confirming a suitable value for h. 15  Results  There were 165,000 ambulance dispatch calls in 1997, increasing to 260,000 in 2005. The mean number of dispatches per week was 3240 in 1997 and 4990 in 2005; the mean, per week, for all years combined was 4253. This varied by month, tending to be lowest in January and highest in August, although the pattern also varied from year to year. For all years combined, the mean number of weekly dispatches in January was 3936, and the corresponding figure for August was 4415.Across all years and all months, the mean weekly number of respiratory dispatches per 1000 total dispatches was 103 (standard deviation 12.4, range 73-146). The smoothed, averaged baseline values varied from 91 in January to 115 in August (Table 1) . For the period 2002-2005, 'influenza' as recorded in the locum service data and 'respiratory or breathing problems' as recorded in the ambulance dispatch data displayed similar seasonal patterns (Fig. 1 ) (2002-2005 was the only period for which locum service data were available).The baseline during non-influenza months was approximately 90 per 1000 ambulance dispatches; in contrast, for the locum service data, it was close to zero. Related to this, the plot for the ambulance dispatch data was less peaked for 2003 (a year known to have higher-than-expected seasonal activity 22 ) than the plot for the locum service data (Fig. 1) . In short, the seasonal pattern was more blurred for the ambulance dispatch data than the locum service data. Use of subclassifications of respiratory or breathing problems, available in the Medical Priority Dispatch System, 13 did not reduce the blurring (data not shown).The CUSUM method was applied to the ambulance dispatch data for the period 1997-2005 to highlight the underlying patterns in the data. The CUSUM signals were compared with previously published analyses based on the GP sentinel surveillance data which reported an epidemic year in 1997 10 and higher-thanexpected seasonal activity in 1998 10 and 2003 22 (Fig. 2) .The GP sentinel surveillance data reached the threshold for higher-than-expected seasonal activity ( Table 2 ).  Discussion  Ambulance dispatch data display seasonal trends similar to those observed in existing ILI surveillance systems, and signalling corresponds to previously defined seasonal thresholds established for GP sentinel surveillance.The disadvantage of ambulance dispatch data is the high baseline rate: 90-100 respiratory dispatches per 1000 total dispatches in months when there is almost no influenza activity in the community. This contrasts with a background rate of less than two per 1000 for the locum service and GP data during the same period. 10 For the ambulance data, seasonal trends are superimposed on this relatively high baseline, which means that any pattern is blurred in comparison with the more specific surveillance systems.There are no studies on the sensitivity and specificity of the category of respiratory or breathing problems (Card 6 in the ambulance dispatch system) in identifying patients with ILI. The high baseline suggests that there are many false positives (i.e. poor specificity), although the seasonal trends (which correspond with those from other surveillance systems) suggest that there may only be a few false negatives (i.e. reasonable sensitivity). Arguably, the addition of specific indicator questions (e.g. concerning cough, fever and fatigue) 9 to existing query algorithms would improve sensitivity and specificity for ILI, but this may not be a realistic commercial option for an ambulance dispatch system.It was only possible to identify one other published study that reported respiratory dispatch calls as a proportion of all ambulance dispatches. 12 That study, from New York, reported an even higher baseline rate in the non-influenza seasons than this study from Melbourne (approximately 200 respiratory dispatches per 1000 total dispatches). A Danish study monitored the total number of ambulance dispatches. 11 When the total number of ambulance j a n 2 0 0 5 0 1 j a n 2 0 0 4 0 1 j a n 2 0 0 3 0 1 j a n 2 0 0 2 0 1 j a n 2 0 0 1 0 1 j a n 2 0 0 0 0 1 j a n 1 9 9 9 0 1 j a n 1 9 9 8 0 1 j a n 1 9 9 7 0 1 j a n 2 0 0 5 0 1 j a n 2 0 0 4 0 1 j a n 2 0 0 3 0 1 j a n 2 0 0 2 0 1 j a n 2 0 0 1 0 1 j a n 2 0 0 0 0 1 j a n 1 9 9 9 0 1 j a n 1 9 9 8 0 1 j a n 1 9 9 7  Epidemic  Higher than expected seasonal activity Figure 2 ). dispatches per week was analysed, using a Gaussian CUSUM (rather than a binomial CUSUM), the results were similar to those presented here. That is, for the time period analysed, an increase in ILI is the main reason for an increase in the total number of ambulance dispatches. However, it is possible that, in a particular year, there may be other reasons for an increase in total ambulance dispatches, such as a heat wave. In this case, respiratory dispatches as a proportion of total dispatches should perform better than the total number of dispatches.The New York study used cyclical regression models with sine and cosine terms to account for seasonal variability, while the study from Denmark used time series methods. A recent comparison of statistical methods for influenza surveillance data found that these two methods, and the CUSUM method used in this study, had similar performance in generating sensitive, specific and timely alerts. 23 Given the similarity of the methods, the present authors preferred the CUSUM method because it is simpler and therefore more suited to routine use. Once seasonally adjusted ILI rates (Y i ) and a threshold value (h) are agreed upon, the CUSUM method can be implemented using spreadsheet software.Due to their wide reach into the community, ambulance dispatch data have been suggested as a means of real-time, syndromic surveillance for early detection of a covert bioterrorism attack or emerging respiratory infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome or pandemic influenza. 12 However, given the high baseline rates for ambulance data from Melbourne and elsewhere, 12 users should be cautious about placing too much reliance on such data for syndromic surveillance.The signalling characteristics of a particular CUSUM plot are determined by the value assigned to h. For this study, a relatively large value was chosen (h ¼ 10) to ensure that higher-than-expected seasonal activity (true alarm) was being identified rather than statistical noise (false alarm).Using a value of 10, it was shown that the ambulance dispatch data signalled in the years known to have higher-than-expected seasonal activity (1998 and 2003) and the epidemic year (1997). 10, 22 There were signals early in 1997 (17 February, 7 April and 14 April), well before the GP sentinel surveillance system reached the threshold for higher-than-expected seasonal activity on 25 June. It is difficult to know, in retrospect, whether these early signals were false positives or an early warning of an epidemic year, because sentinel surveillance and laboratory confirmation is only conducted in Melbourne from May to September (the influenza season in the southern hemisphere).Smaller values of h would have generated more signals, possibly in years with normal seasonal activity. Larger values of h would have generated fewer signals, and may not have generated signals in the years with higher-than-expected seasonal activity. In other words, the sensitivity, specificity and timeliness of the system are dependent on h.Investigators wishing to adapt this method for use in other locations will need to calibrate h against their data to arrive at a suitable value, depending on the local implications of falsenegative and false-positive signals. The seasonally adjusted expected values (i.e. the in-control values or Y i ) may also need to be adapted for local circumstances.A signal from a surveillance system requires further investigation to determine whether there is true higher-than-expected seasonal activity. For ILI surveillance, this is not a costly exercise and would typically involve contacting hospital emergency departments and sentinel general practices, and comparison with other surveillance data sources to determine whether the increase in respiratory dispatches in the ambulance data was reflected in the clinical setting. Given the low cost of investigating false alarms, values of h smaller than used in the present study may be more suitable for routine surveillance. That is, for routine surveillance, a more sensitive (fewer false negatives) but less specific (more false positives) system may be more appropriate.  Conclusions  Ambulance dispatch data display seasonal trends for ILI that are similar to those observed in locum service and GP sentinel surveillance systems, and therefore have potential for syndromic surveillance. However, ambulance dispatch data have high background noise compared with other surveillance data, and would need to be calibrated to suit particular local circumstances.  						1		
2242014	Inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase and growth of human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells and mouse leukemia L1210 cells by N-hydroxy-N′-aminoguanidine derivatives	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7157920/	Abstract A series of N-hydroxy-N′-aminoguanidine (HAG) derivatives were studied and compared for their effects on ribonucleotide reductase activity in cell-free extracts; on nucleic acid synthesis and the growth of human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells; and on mouse leukemia L1210 cells in culture. The HAG derivatives [RCHNNHC(NH)NHOH-tosylate] studied could be grouped as; (1) hydroxy-benzylidines; (2) methoxybenzylidines; and (3) nitrobenzylidines substituted at the R position. 2′-Hydroxybenzylidine-HAG, the lead compound, was relatively active in both HT-29 cells and L1210 cells (20 ± 5 and 13 ± 4 μM for 50% inhibition of HT-29 and L1210 cell growth respectively). The monohydroxybenzylidene compounds were generally more active than the dihydroxy- and trihy-droxybenzylidene-HAG derivatives. The methoxybenzylidene-HAGs were as active as the monohy-droxybenzylidene-HAGs. 2′-Hydroxy-4′-methoxybenzylidene-HAG was much more active than 2′,4′-dihydroxybenzylidene-HAG. The mononitrobenzylidene-HAGs were more active than the dinitro-benzylidene-HAG compound. In general, L1210 cells were more sensitive to the effects of the HAG compounds than were HT-29 cells. There was good agreement between the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of HT-29 cells and that required to inhibit the growth of L1210 cells. There was also good correlation between the ability of HAG derivatives to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase activity and to inhibit tumor cell growth. Some derivatives, such as 2′,3′,4′- and 3′,4′,5′-trihydroxybenzylidene-HAG inhibited L1210 cell growth by 50% at lower concentrations (7.8 and 11.9 μM respectively) than the concentrations needed for 50% inhibition of HT-29 cell growth (196 and 234 μM respectively) and ribonucleotide reductase activity (122 and 188 μM respectively). The studies of nucleic acid synthesis in L1210 cells using [3H]cytidine as a precursor showed that 2′,3′,4′-trihy-droxybenzylidine-HAG inhibited DNA synthesis at a lower concentration (29 μM for 50% inhibition) than was needed for the inhibition of RNA synthesis and formation of [3H]deoxycytidine nucleotides in the acid-soluble fraction (320 and 820 μM for 50% inhibition respectively). These results indicate that 2′,3′,4′-trihydroxybenzylidine-HAG inhibits DNA synthesis in L1210 cells through other mechanisms rather than exclusively through the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity.	INHIBITION OF R~~ONU~LEOTIDE REDUCTASE AND PT,T\'(ImKT T\C UT TRhl A hf f"c\T  Abstract-A series of ~-hydroxy-~~aminoguanidine (HAG) derivatives were studied and compared for their effects on ribonu~leotide reductase activity in cell-free extracts; on nucleic acid synthesis and the growth of human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells; and on mouse leukemia L1210 cells in culture. The HAG derivatives ~RCH=NNHC(=NH) NHOH-tosy~ate] studied could be grouped as: (1) hydroxybenzylidines; (2) methoxyben~lidines;and (3) nitrobenzylidines substituted at the R position. 2'-Hydroxybenzylidine-HAG, the lead compound, was relatively active in both H'T-29 cells and L1210 cells (20 rt S and 13 f 4 pM for SO% inhibition of HT-29 and L1210 cell growth respectively). The monohydroxybenzylidene compounds were generally more active than the dihydroxy-and trihydroxybenzylidene-HAG derivatives. The methoxybenzylidene-HAGS were as active as the monohydroxybenzylidene-HAGS.2'-Hydroxy-4'-methoxybenzylidene-HAG was much more active than 2',4'dihydroxybenzylidene-HAG.The mononitrobenzylidene-HAGS were more active than the dinitrobenzylidene-HAG compound. In general, L1210 cells were more sensitive to the effects of the HAG compounds than were HT-29 cells. There was good agreement between the concentration of drng required to inhibit the growth of HT-29 cells and that required to inhibit the growth of L1210 cells. There was also good correlation between the ability of HAG derivatives to inhibit r~bonu~leotide reductase activity and to inhibit tumor cell growth. Some derivatives, such as 2', 3', 4', inhibited L1210 cell growth by SO% at lower concentrations (7.8 and II .9 PM respectively) than the concentrations needed for SO% inhibition of HT.29 cell growth (1% and 234 HM respectively) and r~bonucleotide reductase activity (122 and 188 PM respectively). The studies of nucleic acid synthesis in Li210 cells using j3H]cytidine as a precursor showed that 2', 3', inhibited DNA synthesis at a lower concentration (29 FM for SO% inhibition) than was needed for the inhibition of RNA synthesis and formation of [jH]deoxycytidine nucleotides in the acid-soluble fraction (320 and 820 PM for SO% inhibition respectively). These results indicate that 2', 3', inhibits DNA synthesis in L1210 cells through other mechanisms rather than exclusively through the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity.A series of N-hydroxy-N'-aminoguanidine (HAGS) derivatives have been synthesized by Lien's group and have been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth and +ihnnnrl~ntiA~ +~&rrtacp R&vity [l-7] . m_p H_A_G .-YYI..."*"Y.'..I ."....._.l__ derivatives, which have a core structure resembling hydroxyurea, are believed to act through the same mechanism as hydroxyurea, a specific inhibitor of the non-heme iron subunit of ribonucleotide reductase.

Further, it was found that there was good correlation between the ability of the HAG derivatives to inhibit L1210 cell growth and to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase activity [4] .

Human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells were grown as a monolayer in RPM1 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 40 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-l-piperazine-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.4, and gentamicin sulfnte (50 me/L).Microculture ietrazolium assay. Single cell suspensions of L1210 celis were obtained by mechanical disa~gregation and of HT-29 cells by trypsinization. The cell counts were performed using a Coulter counter. model ZBI. A modification of the microculture tetrazolium assay (MTT assay) was used, as described by Carmichael et al. [9] . HT-29 cells were seeded into each well of 96well plates at 1500 cells/ well in 150,uL of RPM1 1640 medium. After 48 hr of incubation at 37" in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO,/95% air, drugs in SOpL of medium were added to triplicate culture wells, and plates were incubated for 6 days at 37". Fifteen microliters of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, 5 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 4 hr. At the end of the incubation, the medium was removed from each well, and 150 @L of DMSO was added to solubilize the Mu-formazan product. Absorbance at 490nm (test fiiter) and 630 nm (reference filter) was measured with a Dynatech MR700 microplate reader (Alexandria, VA). L1210 cells were seeded into wells in microculture plates in 15OpL of culture medium 1000 cells/well and were incubated at 37". After 24 hr of incubation, drugs in 50 ,uL of culture medium were added to each well. After 2 days of exposure to drugs, MTT (15 JLL. 5 mg/mL) was added to each well and the ceils were incubated for 4 hr at 37". The plates were centrifuged for 10 min at 5OOg and the culture medium was aspirated carefully. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 15OpL) was added to solubilize the formazan product. After thorough mixing with a multichannel pipetter, absorbance at 570 and 630nm was measured.Assay of ribonucleotide reductase activity. CDP reductase activity was measured by the method of Steeper and Steuart [lo] . The reaction mixture contained in a final volume of 15OvL: ["C]CDP (25 nmol, 0.05 PCi), dithioerythritol (900 nmol), magnesium acetate (600 nmol), ATP (300 nmol), and the partially purified enzyme from Ehrich ascites tumor cells. Since DMSO (final concentration of 0.2%) was required to solubilize the HAG derivatives, all controls received the same amount ot DMSO. All assays were carried out in triplicate. The icsO values were estimated by using the method of Chou and Talalay [ 1 I].[3H]Cytidinr~ rneru/w/i.sn~. The cells were cultured in 8mL of fresh medium in a flask at a final concentration of 6.4 x 10' cells/ml (HT-29 cells) or 4.2 X 10h cells/mL (L1210 cells) with or without drugs. After a YO-min incubation at 37" in humidified 95% air/S% CO,. ]H]cytidine (2 @i) was added to each flask and the cells were incubated further for 30 min. At the end of the incubation period. the cell suspensions were cooled and centrifuged. The cells were collected and subjected to a modified Schmidt-Thannhauser procedure [4, 121 . The acid-soluble fraction was obtained by extraction of the cells with 1 mL of 6% perchloric acid (three times). The acidsoluble fraction was neutralized with 5 M KOH, and the KCIOJ was removed by centrifugation.The supernatant fluid was Iyophilized. dissolved in 0.7 mL of 0. I M Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and then incubated with crude snake venom (Crotalus atrox, 3.2 mg) for 4 hr at 37". The reaction was stopped by heating the tube in a boning water bath for 4min and the samples were applied to a f-mL column of Dowex-l-borate to separate deoxyc~~t~dine from cytidine 1131. The acid-insoluble fraction was dissolved in I mL of 0.5 M NaOH and incubated overnight at 37". The solution was cooled and 60% perchloric acid was added to reprecipitate DNA. After centrifugation. the supernatant fluid (RNA) was transferred to another tube, and the pellet was solubilized in 0.5 M NaQH.  Effects of HAG dcrirxitives on thegrowth of HT-29  ceils and L1210 c&s. The microculture tetrazolium assay (MTT assay) was used to evaluate the effects of HAG derivatives on the growth of HT-29 cells and LI210 cells. The structures of the HAG derivatives [RCN=NNHC(=NH)N~~OH tosylate] are given in Fig. 1 : and the data are presented in Table I . Group I compounds were hydroxylated-benzylidene derivatives. The monohydroxylated benzylidine-HAG (IA) was the most active in this group of compounds; 2',4'-dihydroxybenzylidene-HAG (IB) was the least active. L1210 cells were much more sensitive to compounds IC and IE than were HT-29 cells as measured by the MTT growth assay. To confirm these differences, growth studies were conducted in which cell counts were made. Cell count data (not shown) showed that these differences between the rcsfl values for HT-29 and L1210 cells were real and were not due to an artifact of the MTT assay. Group II compounds were methoxy-substituted analogs. Compounds IIA and IIB were more active as inhibitors of tumor cell growth than was compound IIC. Group III compounds had nitro-groups substituted on the benzylidene ring. The mononitro-substituted compounds (IIIA, B and D) were more active than dinitro-substituted HAG (IIIC). In general, L1210 cells were more sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of these HAG compounds than were the HT-29 cells.Effect~s of HAG derivutives on r~bo~ucieot~d~~ redz~ct~.~e uctiuity. 'The effects of HAG derivatives on ribonucleotide reductase activity were studied using CDP as the substrate for ribonLIcle~tide reductase. As seen in Table 1 , in general there was good correlation between the effects of these compounds on ribonucleotide reductase activity and on tumor cell growth. For some derivatives, such as 3',6'-dimethoxybenzylidine-HAG (IIC) and 2'hydroxy-5'-nitrobenzylidine-HAG (IIIB), relatively higher concentrations of these compounds were required to inhibit ~bonucIeotide reductase activity than to inhibit tumor cell~growth. For other compounds such as 3',4',5'-(IE) and 2'.3',4'-trihy-droxybenzylidin~-GAG (IC), there was not a good correlation between the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase and the inhibition of L1210 cell growth. These compounds inhibited L1210 cell growth at much lower concentrations than those required for the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity. (in situ ribonucleotide reductase activity) were measured.

In L1210 cells, 2',3',4'-trihydroxybenzylidine-HAG (IC) inhibited DNA synthesis to a greater extent than either RNA synthesis or deoxycytidine nucleotide formation.  DISCUSSION  The reaction in which ribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates are reduced to the corresponding 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates is catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase. This step is the rate-limiting process in the de nouo synthesis of the deoxyribonucleoside trophosphates required for DNA synthesis [14-161. Ribonucleotide reductase activity is cetl cycle dependent and increases dramatically at late G,-early S phase [17, 181. Further. it has been shown that the activity of this enzyme is elevated in relation to the growth rate of a tumor [ 19. 201. Thus. ribonucleotide reductase is an appropriate site for enzvme-targeted chenlotherapy. The results of our St&es indicate that the inhibition of tumor cell growth by the HAG derivatives is generally related to their inhibitory effects on ribonucleotide reductaae activity. Some HAG derivatives, such as 2', . may have additional mechanisms of action. Elford er al. [21] have studied a series of polyhydroxybenzeIle derivatives of hydroxamic acid. Using an assay with the stable free-radical, diphenylpicrylhydrazyl.it was shown that the trihydroxy-derivatives of benzohydroxamic acids consumed the free-radical at a rate at least 80 times that of the monohydroxybenzohydroxamic acid. It is possible that 2',3',4'trihydroxybenzylidene-HAG (IC) also has other int~cellular sites of action involving an ~l~teracti[)n with free radicals.2',3',4'-Trihydroxybenzylidine-HAG (1C) also inhibited RNA synthesis. This result differs from that of hydroxyurea, in that hydroxyurca (and other HAG derivatives) does not inhibit RNA synthesis on short-term incubation [S]. It is not clear whether the inhibition of RNA synthesis by this compound is essential for the inhibition of tumor cell growth.Small structural changes in the R-group of HAG derivatives greatly aftered the potency of these derivatives. The potency of the HAG derivatives was compared on the basis of their ICKY) values. The IC~(, values for tumor cell growth were determined by MTT assay. These values corresponded very closely to the icso values that were determined for some of the HAG compounds by direct cell count using the Coulter counter. With respect to the hydroxybenzylidene-HAGS, the monohydroxybenzylidine- In contrast, the substitution of a methoxy group on the 4-position (IIA) did not alter the inhibitory natrlrp nf the UAG C1eriwtivmThe ~TPCP~,.P nf a .'U.UlV VL L.." 114.w YII.,ULL,VY. AL." y,.,""..C" <II u hydroxy substituent at the 3'-position of the R-group seemed to play an important role in inhibiting L1210 cell growth. In the methoxybenzyiidine-GAG group of compounds, placement of a methoxy substituent(s) on the benzyiidine ring at either the 4'-or 6'position did not alter the effect of 2'-hydroxybenzylidine-HAG (IA) on ribonucleotide reductase activity and tumor cell growth. However. 3,6-dimethoxybenzylidine-HAG (IIC) was less active in both HT-29 cells and L1210 cells than was 2'hydroxy-4'-methoxybenzylidine-HAG (IIA) or 2'hydroxy-4',6'-dimethoxybenzylidine-HAG (IIB), and it had almost no activity as an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase activity.The addition of a chloro substituent on 3'-nitrobenzylidine-HAG did not alter its inhibitory properties.When the activity of 2'-hydroxy-5'-nitrobenzylid~ne-HAG (IIIB) was compared with that of 2'-hydroxybenzylidine-HAG (IA), it was seen that a nitro substituent at the 5'-position of the Rgroup increased the activity of 2'-hydroxybenzylidine-HAG in L1210 cells 5.5-fold and decreased its ~bonucleotid~ reductase inhibitory activity by 55%. When the activity of 2'-hydroxy-3',5'-dinitrobenzylidine-HAG (IIIC) was compared with that of 2'-hydroxy-5'-nitrobenzylidine-HAG (IIIB), it was seen that the addition of the nitro substituent at the 3'-position of the phenyl ring decreased the activity of this compound as an inhibitor of the growth of HT-29 and L1210 cells. The presence of a nitro substituent either increased or decreased the inhibition of tumor cell growth and ribonucleotide reductase activity relative to 2'-hydroxybenzylidene-HAG. It appears that the effect of a nitro substituent depends on the ring position or the number of nitro substituents on the phenyl ring of 2'-hydroxybenzylidine-HAGS .In conclusion, our results show that most of the HAG derivatives examined in this series were more active in both f-IT-29 cells and L1210 cells than hydroxyurea(IQ values for HT-29 and L1210 cells were 206 and 38 I.LM respectively).These compounds appeared to inhibit tumor cell growth by inhibiting cellular ribonucleotide reductase activity, while some of the comnounds anneared to inhibit I.1210 ceil r ---------=r--------._______. ----_ --__ growth at lower concentrations by targeting other metabolic sites as well as ribonucleotide reductase.The potency of the HAG derivatives as inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase and tumor cell growth depended not only on the nature of the substituent but also on the location of the substituent on the phenyl ring.  					1			
12836951	Health and Performance of Holstein Calves that Suckled or Were Hand-Fed Colostrum and Were Fed One of Three Physical Forms of Starter 1	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095194/	Abstract Intake of colostrum by neonatal calves and early transition to calf starter are two important factors in successful calf programs. Thirty-one Holstein calves were used to determine health and performance of calves that were 1) allowed to remain with their dams for 3 d and suckle (suckled calves) or were removed from their dams and fed colostrum only by bottle (bottle calves); and were 2) fed ground, pelleted, or textured starters, formulated to be isonitrogenous. Bottle calves were removed from their dams at birth, fed 2.84L of colostrum, placed in individual hutches, and fed 1.89L of colostrum 12h after the first feeding. Suckled calves were removed from their dams after 3 d and placed in individual hutches. Once calves were housed in hutches, they were fed 2L of whole milk twice daily and were provided starters and water beginning on d 3. Calves were weighed at birth and weekly for 6 wk. Blood samples were obtained at birth, 24h, and weekly for serum protein determination. Starter intake, fecal scores, and electrolyte treatments were recorded daily. Weaning began when calves had consumed 0.68kg starter for 2 d consecutively. There were no differences in treatment means between suckled and bottle calves for total gain, grain consumption, days with fecal scores >2, or electrolyte treatments per calf. Average days to weaning was greater for bottle calves compared with suckled calves. Mean serum protein concentration at 24h was greater for bottle (6.0 g/dl) compared with suckled calves (5.8 g/dl) and only 2 of 15 bottle calves had serum protein concentrations <5.0 g/dl compared with 6 of 16 suckled calves. For starter treatments, calves fed textured starter consumed more total grain, were weaned earlier, and weighed more at 6 wk of age than calves fed pelleted starter. Based on 24-h serum protein concentrations, transfer of passive immunity was greater for bottle calves compared with suckled calves.	INTRODUCTION  Transfer of passive immunity to calves must occur by ingestion of colostrum because sufficient Ig are not passed across the placenta to calves in utero as indicated by practically no Ig present in serum at birth (Franklin et al., 1998) . Furthermore, calves have a relatively naive immune system at birth that inhibits their ability to mount an effective immune response as evidenced by the gradual decline of Ig from 24 h after the first feeding of colostrum through approximately 3 wk of age, and the increase in numbers and percentages of B-cells through 6 wk of age (Nagahata et al., 1991; Franklin et al., 1998) . The method used to supply colostrum to a calf can have a major impact on absorption of Ig and, thus, the health, performance, and survival of the calf (Besser et al., 1991) . Without question, the successful transfer of passive immunity is an extremely important component for minimizing death losses of calves (Wells et al., 1996) . In the United States, the most recent national data indicate that approximately 55% of calves are allowed to remain with the dam and nurse, while 45% are removed prior to nursing (NAHMS, 1996) . Of those remaining with the dam, 29.4% of the calves received their first colostrum by nursing the dam, which leaves approximately 25% of calves receiving first colostrum by a combination of nursing and hand-feeding.Several studies (Stott et al., 1979b; Nocek et al., 1984; Quigley et al., 1995) have been conducted regarding the most effective method of supplying colostrum. Results of these studies are inclusive. Nocek et al. (1984) reported that Holstein calves fed a total of 5.45 L of colostrum in three feedings by bottle during the first 12 h after birth had higher serum protein and serum IgG concentrations than calves that remained with their dams for 24 h and were allowed to suckle. In contrast, Quigley et al. (1995) reported that Jersey calves that suckled had higher serum IgG concentrations compared with calves fed 2 L of colostrum by bottle in the first 12 h. Stott et al. (1979b) reported greater Ig absorption by Holstein calves allowed to suckle their dam over a 24-h period compared with calves fed by bottle; however, the greatest amount fed by bottle was only 4 L during the first 12 h after birth. The results of these studies may be related, at least in part, to the amount of colostrum fed by bottle rather than differences caused by suckling versus bottle-feeding.Another important component in successful calf rearing programs is an early transition to starter grain. Earlier consumption of starter grains allows for earlier weaning resulting in decreased labor costs and potentially lower feed costs while still achieving adequate growth (Davis and Drackley, 1998b) .Development of rumen papillae is aided by the fermentation of calf starter to VFA (Anderson et al., 1987) . Growth of rumen papillae aids in allowing the calf to change from a monogastric form of digestion to one characteristic of adult ruminants (Warner, 1991) . When calves consume both calf starter and water at an early age, maturation of the rumen occurs at an earlier age compared with milk-feeding alone. This progress toward maturation of the rumen allows calves to be weaned effectively as early as 4 wk (Anderson et al., 1987) .Few studies have investigated the effect of the physical form of calf starters on intake, performance, and weaning age. Earlier studies (Warner et al., 1973; Warner, 1991) concluded that the ingredients for calf starters should not be finely ground and at least 50% of the particles should be larger than 1190 μm. No recently published studies have considered differences in age at weaning or performance of calves fed a traditional ground calf starter compared with commercial pelleted or textured calf starters.The objective of this study, therefore, was twofold. The first objective was to evaluate differences in health and performance of calves allowed to suckle colostrum from the dam and remain with her for 3 d, a common farm practice, compared with calves fed a total of 4.73 L of colostrum by bottle only during the first 12 h after birth. The second objective was to compare weaning age and performance of calves offered either ground, pelleted, or textured starter.   Calves and Treatments  Thirty Holstein calves were blocked by gender and assigned to treatments in a 2 × 3 factorial model designed to evaluate effects of method of colostrum consumption and physical form of starter on health and performance. One of the male calves died and was replaced. Calves were born at the University of Kentucky Coldstream Dairy Farm. All animal procedures were in accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Agricultural Animals in Agricultural Research and Teaching and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Calves were weighed and assigned at birth to treatments of suckled (S) colostrum vs. bottle-fed (B) colostrum (six female and nine male calves/treatment). The S calves remained with their dam for 3 d to allow for maximum voluntary intake of Ig before being moved to individual calf hutches. Based on common on-farm procedures, the S calves were helped to suckle one time or were given a small amount of colostrum (approximately 0.5 L), hand-milked from the dam, by bottle to stimulate suckling if they were observed to be slow to stand. Calves in the B group were removed from their dams before suckling, fed 2.84 L of colostrum by bottle, placed in individual calf hutches, and fed another 1.89 L of colostrum by bottle 12 h after the first feeding. Fresh colostrum from the dam was used for B calves if it measured greater than 60 mg of Ig/ml of colostrum using a colostrometer. Otherwise, high-quality (>60 mg of Ig/ml) frozen colostrum was warmed to at least 26°C and fed. The first feeding for B calves averaged less than 3 h after birth. Thereafter, all calves in hutches were fed 2 L of whole milk twice daily by bottle or bucket. If calves refused to consume at least 2.6 L of the first feeding or 1.75 L of subsequent feedings, they were fed using an esophageal feeder.At 3 d of age, calves were assigned to treatments of ground (GS), pelleted (PS), or textured (TS) starters (four female and six male calves/treatment). The GS was a typical calf starter ration with oats ( Table 1) . The PS and TS were typical commercial type starters with the same ingredients except that the TS contained oats. All starters were formulated to be isonitrogenous at 22% CP and all contained 0.07% lasalocid. The chemical composition of the starters is provided in Table 2 . Starter intake was determined daily, and BW were obtained weekly. Ad libitum water was provided for calves from 3 d of age throughout the study.Fecal scores and health observations were recorded at the morning feeding. Fluidity of feces was scored on a four-point scale, with 1 = normal feces to 4 = watery feces (Larson et al., 1977) , and weekly means were cal- culated. Calves that developed diarrhea (fecal score >2) were supplemented with an oral electrolyte solution (Biolyte; Pharmacia, Inc., Kalamazoo, MI) approximately 20 min after each milk feeding until fecal scores were ≤2. Fecal samples were sent to the University of Kentucky Livestock Disease Diagnostic Center to identify causative agents. One calf died at the age of 5 wk and was taken to the Diagnostic Center for evaluation.Calves started the weaning process after they had consumed 0.68 kg of starter/d for 2 d, consecutively. Calves were weaned by feeding 1 L of whole milk twice daily for 4 d, followed by complete weaning from milk on d 5.  Sample Collection and Analysis  Blood samples were obtained in Vacutainer tubes (Becton Dickinson Vacutainer Systems, Franklin Lakes, NJ) via jugular venipuncture as soon after birth as possible, at 24 h, and weekly for 6 wk. Serum was harvested from 10-ml Vacutainer tubes without antico- agulant for immediate determination of total serum protein concentrations (SPC) using a handheld refractometer (Westover Model RHC-200ATC, China). The remainder of the serum was frozen at −20°C until analy- sis for IgM and IgG concentrations by ELISA (Franklin et al., 1995) . Serum samples were diluted 1:100,000 (vol/vol) for determination of IgM and 1:400,000 for determination of IgG.  Statistical Analysis  Analysis for variables with only treatment means. The general linear models procedure of SAS (1996) was used to determine if differences among treatment means existed. Method of feeding colostrum, physical form of starter, and gender were tested as main effects and there were no interactions between method of feeding colostrum and physical form of starter. One calf died during the study and was not included in the analyses related to physical form of calf starter because the calf was sick during most of the study and would have skewed the data relating to feed intake and weight gain. Six-week means relating to physical form of the calf starter were compared using pairwise t-tests. Differences among treatment means were considered significant at P < 0.05.Analysis for variables with repeated measures. Data with repeated measures were analyzed using the mixed model procedure of SAS (SAS/STAT Software, 1996). Method of colostrum feeding, physical form of starter, gender, and time were tested as main effects. A covariate was included in the model when appropriate but was removed from the model when not significant. All two-way and three-way effects were tested and removed from the model when not significant. There were no significant interactions between method of feeding colostrum and physical form of starter for any of the variables analyzed. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05 unless otherwise stated.  Method of Colostrum Consumption  Thirty of 31 calves completed the study through 6 wk of age. One male calf, which was fed colostrum by suckling, died at 5 wk of age after prolonged diarrhea and was not included in data analyses related to feed intake and weight gain. The calf was included in data relating to health parameters such as fecal scores, electrolyte treatments, serum protein concentrations, and serum IgM and IgG concentrations that would be directly related to method of feeding colostrum. Of the 15 B calves, only three calves required the use of an esophageal feeder to supply part of the first allotment of colostrum. An esophageal feeder was only used if calves refused more than 0.24 L of colostrum after multiple attempts to feed the calf by nipple-bottle. Lactation numbers were similar for the dams of the S and B calves. For the dams of the S calves, eight were first lactation cows and eight were second or greater lactation cows. For the dams of the B calves, seven were first lactation and eight were second or greater lactation, with average colostrum quality of 87 and 89 mg/ml, respectively. Six dams of B calves either were first lactation animals that were difficult to milk, did not produce enough colostrum, or colostrum quality was low which required the use of frozen colostrum to provide calves with 2.84 L at birth and 2 L at 12 h after birth. Similar problems with low volume or low quality colostrum for dams of calves that are allowed to suckle naturally would place those calves at risk for failure of passive transfer of immunity.Performance of S and B calves is presented in Table  3 . The average number of days to weaning was greater (P = 0.1) for B calves compared with S calves. One explanation for this difference might be that calves left with their dams became accustomed to eating at frequent intervals compared to B calves, which were fed milk twice daily. If calves became accustomed to eating frequently, once they were restricted to twice daily feedings of milk, they may have continued to search for food at frequent intervals and become familiar with consuming grain earlier. Initial and final BW were similar for S and B calves (Table 3) . Total weight gain, total grain consumed, and total milk consumed were not different (P > 0.1) between treatments even though S calves weaned at an earlier age.Serum protein concentrations measured at birth were used for covariate analysis and averaged 4.2 ± 0.5 g/dl for B calves and 4.4 ± 0.3 g/dl for S calves. Mean SPC did not differ between treatments; however, there was a significant (P = 0.03) treatment × day effect for method of feeding colostrum (Figure 1 ). At 24 h after birth, the SPC was greater (P = 0.03) for B calves compared with S calves. The SPC at wk 1 tended (P = 0.1) to be greater for B calves compared with S calves. By wk 2, the mean SPC for both groups of calves was approximately 5.5 g/dl and remained fairly constant through the rest of the study. The percent increase in SPC by 24 h after the first feeding for B calves was 42.4% with only 2 of the 15 B calves having SPC less than 5.0 g/dl. In comparison, the mean increase in SPC for S calves from birth to 24 h was only 28.5% and six of the 16 calves (37.5%) allowed to suckle had SPC of 5.0 g/dl or less; indicating greater transfer of passive immunity to B calves and less than desired transfer to S calves (Table 3) . A SPC of 5.5 g/dl has been suggested as an indicator of minimal colostrum intake (Naylor et al., 1977; Wilson et al., 1994) . Tyler et al. (1998) , however, indicated that an SPC of 5.0 g/dl was a more reasonable goal based on the relative risk of mortality for calves with SPC less than 5.0 g/dl compared with calves with SPC > 5.0 g/dl. In a review of passive transfer of immunity in calves by Weaver et al. (2000) , the authors indicated that the percent of calves with SPC < 5.0 g/dl was a better indicator of risk of mortality than mean serum IgG or mean SPC. Selman et al. (1970) reported characteristics of calves allowed to suckle. They observed 30 cow and calf pairs (10 each of beef cows, dairy heifers, and dairy cows) for 8 h postpartum. Seven of the 30 calves (23%) did not suckle within the 8 h period. Selman et al. (1970) also reported that of the calves that suckled, the beef calves suckled at a mean of 81.4 min after birth, whereas the calves from dairy heifers required a mean of 218.3 min and the calves from the dairy cows required 261.1 min. The authors suggested that dairy cows have been bred for high milk production, resulting in more developed mammary glands compared with wild ungulates, making dairy cows harder to suckle. Abel Francisco and Quigley (1993) reported a decrease in apparent efficiency of absorption of Ig within 1 h after birth. The delay in consumption of colostrum that can occur in dairy calves allowed to suckle compared with calves fed by bottle may have contributed to the lower SPC at 24 h in S calves compared with B calves. In the current study, calves that were not observed to be standing and attempting to nurse were fed a small amount of maternal colostrum by bottle or were aided in suckling so that differences in Ig absorption between S and B calves were not as great as may have occurred if calves were left to suckle alone. The calf that died in the current study either failed to suckle the dam or failed to absorb immunoglobulins. The calf was observed to be standing and moving about the stall after birth, but SPC did not increase from birth to 24 h.Mean serum IgM and IgG concentrations did not differ between S and B calves (Figure 2) , and there was not a treatment × day interaction for method of feeding colostrum. Beginning serum IgM and IgG concentrations were tested as covariates but were removed from the model. In general, the shape of the curves for SPC, and serum IgM and IgG concentrations were similar; however, there was greater variability among calves in the concentrations of IgG and IgM, as measured by the ELISA assay, compared with the variability among calves for SPC as determined by a refractometer. Based on the ELISA assay, three of the S calves had IgG concentrations below 1 g/dl at 24 h compared with only 1 B calf with a serum IgG concentration below 1 g/dl. Values for SPC, and serum IgM and IgG concentrations were similar to previously reported values (Franklin et al., 1998) .The mean number of days calves had fecal scores greater than 2 and the mean number of electrolyte treatments per calf did not differ because of method of colostrum consumption (Table 3 ). Most incidences of fecal scores greater than 2 occurred during wk 2 and 3, which is consistent with previous reports (Quigley et al., 1995; Franklin et al., 1998) . Whereas the differences in SPC did not translate into significantly more days with diarrhea or increased electrolyte treatments, the calves in the current study were relatively healthy. Pathogens detected from fecal samples of calves with diarrhea were Cryptosporidium parvum, coronavirus, and rotavirus. The suspected cause of diarrhea in most of the calves, Cryptosporidium parvum, is not controlled by ingestion of colostrum (Harp et al., 1990) . Under less sanitary conditions, the lower transfer of passive immunity to the S calves compared with the B calves may have resulted in increased calf morbidity or mortality.Results from previous studies to determine the most effective method of supplying colostrum to calves are inconclusive. Many methods have been considered. Logan et al. (1981) , using Friesian calves, compared serum Ig concentrations of calves that suckled only with those of calves that were left with the dam but were fed approximately 1 L of hand-milked colostrum by bottle for the first feeding. Results indicated that only 23.2% of the calves allowed to suckle naturally acquired sufficient Ig, whereas 42.3% of calves fed 1 L of colostrum by hand and also were left with the dam to suckle acquired sufficient serum Ig concentrations. Nocek et al. (1984) reported that Holstein calves fed a total of 5.45 L of colostrum in three feedings by bottle during the first 12 h after birth had higher serum protein and serum IgG concentrations than calves that suckled. Besser et al. (1991) reported that failure of passive transfer (serum protein <5.0 g/dl or IgG <1.0 g/dl) occurred in 61% of Holstein calves allowed to suckle at birth compared to 19% failure of passive transfer in Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 86, No. 6, 2003 calves fed 1.9 L by bottle at birth and only 11% failure of passive transfer in calves fed 2.84 L by using an esophageal feeder at birth.In contrast, Quigley et al. (1995) reported that Jersey calves that suckled had higher serum IgG concentrations than did calves fed by bottle. The Jersey calves fed from bottles, however, were limited to only 2 L of colostrum (approximately 8% of BW) before obtaining the 24-h blood sample for analysis of passive transfer. Calves allowed to suckle the dam may have obtained a greater volume of colostrum than calves fed from a bottle, resulting in improved transfer of passive immunity for calves allowed to suckle. Stott et al. (1979b) also reported greater Ig absorption by Holstein calves allowed to suckle compared with calves fed by bottle; however, the amounts fed by bottle were limited to 1, 2, or 4 L during the first 12 h after birth. For the studies in which calves fed by bottle had better transfer of passive immunity, the amount fed to Holstein calves by bottle during the first 12 h varied considerably with volumes of 5.45 L (Nocek et al., 1984) , 4.74 L (present study), and either 2.84 L at birth or 3.8 L during the first 12 h (Besser et al., 1991) . In general, it appears that a volume of 2 L of colostrum at birth is the minimum that should be fed by bottle to a Holstein calf when the calf will only be fed twice during the first 12 h of life. In the present study using Holstein calves, seven of 15 calves voluntarily consumed 2.84 L by bottle during the first feeding and five more calves consumed between 2.6 and 2.84 L voluntarily. Only three calves required the use of an esophageal feeder for administration of colostrum. Therefore, 2.84 L of colostrum is likely the volume that should be fed at birth to maximize transfer of passive immunity without resorting to forced feeding of colostrum with an esophageal feeder.By removing calves from their dam and hand-feeding 2.84 L of high-quality colostrum as soon as possible after birth, calves should be exposed to fewer diseasecausing organisms and producers can insure that calves receive colostrum. Producers also can insure calves ingest colostrum before gut closure, which occurs by about 24 h after birth (Stott et al., 1979a) . Additionally, although feeding 4 L of colostrum at birth resulted in increased concentrations of Ig in serum compared with feeding 2 L of colostrum (Morin et al., 1997) , calves may not voluntarily consume 4 L and must be fed using an esophageal feeder. Morin et al. (1997) reported that 7 of 11 calves (64%) fed 4 L at birth required the use of an esophageal feeder for one or more meals compared with 10 of 40 calves (25%) fed 2 L of colostrum. Feeding 2.84 L at birth provided greater transfer of passive immunity compared to suckling, without requiring the use of an esophageal feeder for most of the calves. Values with different superscripts differ at P ≤ 0.05.  Physical Form of Calf Starter  Performance of calves based on physical form of starter is provided in Table 4 . Calves fed TS required fewer (P = 0.03) days to achieve intakes of 0.68 kg/d than calves fed PS. Calves fed GS tended (P = 0.07) to require fewer days to intakes of 0.68 kg/d than calves fed PS. Total gain was greater (P = 0.02) for calves fed TS compared with calves fed PS, with greater average daily gains occurring for all groups from 4 through 6 wk of age compared with birth through 3 wk of age. Total grain consumed was greater (P = 0.03) for calves fed TS compared with PS and tended to be greater (P = 0.07) for calves fed GS compared with calves fed PS. Starter intake during the first 3 wk of life did not differ based on physical form of starter; however, calves did begin to consume starter before 3 wk of age. From 4 through 6 wk of age, calves fed TS consumed approximately 72% more starter compared with calves fed PS. Calves fed PS consumed more total milk (P = 0.04) than did calves fed TS. For the 6 wk period, calves fed TS consumed approximately 80% more starter and 11% less milk than calves fed PS. The number of days calves experienced diarrhea or were supplemented with electrolytes did not differ (P > 0.1) among treatments.There was a significant (P = 0.005) treatment × week interaction for physical form of starter (Figure 3 ). During wk 5, calves fed GS and TS consumed more (P < 0.05) starter at approximately 0.7 kg/d compared with calves consuming PS at approximately 0.4 kg/d. During wk 6, the difference in starter consumption between TS and PS increased, as a result of earlier weaning from whole milk, so that calves fed TS consumed approximately 35% more starter than calves fed PS. Calves fed TS, GS, and PS consumed an average of 1.4, 1.2, and 0.8 kg/d, respectively, during wk 6.Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 86, No. 6, 2003 Beginning BW was tested as a covariate for influence of calf starter on weekly BW but did not significantly affect the model and was removed. There was a tendency for a treatment × day interaction (P = 0.06) for the effect of physical form of starter on weekly BW. Mean BW gradually increased throughout the trial. On d 42, calves fed TS had greater (P = 0.03) BW compared with calves fed PS (Figure 4) . Calves did not suffer BW losses during wk 2 and 3, when episodes of diarrhea are especially prevalent. Calves also did not experience weight loss during the weaning period. All calves had reached starter intakes of at least 0.68 kg/d by 42 d of age and were weaned.Performance of calves was affected by the amount of starter feed consumed. Calves that consumed greater amounts of starter, those fed TS, had improved growth rates, consumed less milk, and were weaned sooner than calves fed PS, which ultimately would result in decreased costs for dairy producers. Warner et al. (1973) reported that calves fed starter in meal form have greater intakes and daily weight gain than calves fed starter in pelleted form. The authors attributed the improved intake and performance obtained with meal to greater particle size of the starter and increased rumination. Beharka et al. (1998) fed calves a hay and grain diet either unground or ground to 1 mm particle size. They reported that calves fed the ground diet had less total surface area associated with dorsal papillae in the rumen compared with calves fed the diet that was not ground. Owen and Larson (1986) , however, compared intake of calves fed starter as a meal form with the same mix in pelleted form and did not find differences in starter intake or performance. Pelleted and textured commercial starters had not been previously compared. The greater intakes and performance achieved with TS compared to PS may have been related to particle size of the PS compared to the TS.It is possible that the greater protein content of the TS (25.8% CP, Table 2 ) may have partially accounted for the greater BW gains compared with calves fed the PS (22.2% CP). Akayezu et al. (1994) , however, reported that maximum growth of calves was achieved at 19.6% CP with no additional advantage of higher protein content.Nationally, calves are weaned at an average of 8.7 wk of age (NAHMS, 1996) , however, calves can be safely and effectively weaned by 4 wk of age (Anderson et al., 1987) . In the present study, calves fed GS and TS were voluntarily consuming at least 0.68 kg of starter feed Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 86, No. 6, 2003 by an average of approximately 4.5 wk of age and were weaned. Weaning at 4 to 5 wk of age compared with 8.7 wk of age could result in substantial savings for producers because starter feed generally is less expensive than milk replacer or tank milk (Heinrichs, 1993) . Additionally, less labor is required to feed calves grain than milk or milk replacer. Finally, ruminal development occurs at an earlier age in calves weaned earlier (4 wk of age) compared with calves weaned at a more conventional age of 6 wk (Anderson et al., 1987) . If calves prefer textured or ground starter over pelleted starter, consumption and performance could improve and age at weaning, health, and labor costs could decrease.  CONCLUSIONS  The number of calves with SPC of less than 5.0 g/ dl for S calves indicates a lower transfer of passive immunity compared with B calves and a potential for increased morbidity and mortality for calves allowed to suckle. These differences likely would have been greater if the S calves had not been aided at birth in suckling. This study lends support to current recommendations for removing the calf from the dam and feeding at least 2.84 L by nipple bottle. Physical form of the starter supplied to calves can have an impact on performance and age at weaning. Adequate transfer of passive immunity and decreased age at weaning with improved performance of calves will improve profitability of heifer rearing as well as decrease calf losses through mortality.  					1			
24769245	Arbidol as a broad-spectrum antiviral: An update	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7113885/	Abstract Arbidol (ARB) is a Russian-made small indole-derivative molecule, licensed in Russia and China for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza and other respiratory viral infections. It also demonstrates inhibitory activity against other viruses, enveloped or not, responsible for emerging or globally prevalent infectious diseases such as hepatitis B and C, gastroenteritis, hemorrhagic fevers or encephalitis. In this review, we will explore the possibility and pertinence of ARB as a broad-spectrum antiviral, after a careful examination of its physico-chemical properties, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and molecular mechanisms of action. Recent studies suggest that ARB’s dual interactions with membranes and aromatic amino acids in proteins may be central to its broad-spectrum antiviral activity. This could impact on the virus itself, and/or on cellular functions or critical steps in virus-cell interactions, thereby positioning ARB as both a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) and a host-targeting agent (HTA). In the context of recent studies in animals and humans, we will discuss the prospective clinical use of ARB in various viral infections.	Introduction  Arbidol (ARB) has been administered for decades in Russia and China against influenza, with no major adverse effects reported. Its vast potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, defined through in vitro and in vivo studies, lends hope for its clinical use against various infectious diseases that are at present not therapeutically controlled. However, evidence for beneficial effects in humans, especially in the perspective of long-term administration in chronic diseases, remains equivocal. This could be attributable to a relative lack of standardized animal studies and controlled clinical trials in healthy and infected subjects. In addition to influenza and pathogenic human respiratory viruses, ARB shows mainly in vitro inhibitory activity against the hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), reovirus, Hantaan virus and coxsackie virus B5.In this paper, we update current knowledge about ARB, linking its physico-chemical properties to its molecular mode of action, toxicity and possible pharmaceutical forms. We will outline recent studies on the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which ARB may inhibit several steps of viral life cycles, and discuss how ARB is emerging as both a direct-acting agent (DAA) and a host-targeting agent (HTA).  Overview of ARB: history, initial clinical studies in Russia and  China, toxicity ARB, or ethyl-6-bromo-4-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-5-hydroxy-1-methyl-2 [(phenylthio)methyl]-indole-3-carboxylate hydrochloride monohydrate, is a small indole derivative (Fig. 1A) . It is also called umifenovir. Its invention is attributed to a joint consortium of Russian scientists from the Chemical-Pharmaceutical Scientific Research Institute of Russia, the Scientific Research Institute of Medical Radiology in Obninsk and the Leningrad-Pasteur Scientific Research Institute for epidemiology and microbiology, some 40 years ago, as described in:arbidol.net/robert-nikolaevich-glushkov.html arbidol.org/1973-4-arbidol-invented-WAY-To-THE DISCOVERY.pdf arbidol.org/article1.html.One of the first descriptions of its chemical synthesis was published in 1993 (Trofimov et al., 1993) , and modified later on Miller and Bergeron (1994) . The drug is manufactured by Moscow-based Masterlek™, a subsidiary of Pharmstandard Group (see below), and by Shijiazhuang No.4 Pharmaceutical™ in China (http://www.sjzsiyao.com/products_detail/&productId=46.html).ARB has been marketed for 20 years in Russia and has been used since 2006 in China for the prophylaxis and treatment of human pulmonary diseases caused by influenza A and B viruses and other human pathogenic respiratory viruses, as reviewed in Boriskin et al. (2008) , Brooks et al. (2004) . It is also used to prevent flu epidemics in poultry in China (Berendsen et al., 2012) , and is available from Chinese companies specialized in animal health products, such as: http://depond.b2bage.com/product-chemical-auxiliary-agent/ 1503414/arbidol-hydrochloride-pharmaceutical-rawmaterial.htmlThe first reports on the clinical efficacy of ARB were published in Russian in the 1990s, in groups of students and industrial workers during epidemics of influenza A and outbreaks of acute respiratory diseases (Gagarinova et al., 1993; Obrosova-Serova et al., 1991) . Later studies performed in servicemen reported the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of prophylactic or curative treatments of ARB against acute respiratory viral infections, where ARB was shown to decrease the febrile period (Shumilov et al., 2002; Shuster et al., 2004) . When the information is available, the duration of ARB treatment varies from 5 to 20 days.Chinese clinical studies with similar design (patient inclusion criteria, ARB doses and duration of administration) point to a comparable efficacy and tolerability of ARB (Wang et al., 2004) . ARB efficacy compared well or even better with that of other commonly used antiviral molecules such as rimantadine (Roflual Ò ), oseltamivir (Tamiflu Ò ), ribavirin or interferon-alpha Kolobukhina et al., 2008 Kolobukhina et al., , 2009 Leneva and Shuster, 2006) . It potentiated the in vitro effect of rimantadine against influenza A and B viruses , enhanced the immunomodulatory properties of the anti-flu vaccine Vaxigrip Ò , administered in a cohort of 125 elderly patients (Semenenko et al., 2005) , and had a beneficial effects on flu in patients with another infectious immunodeficiency (Glushkov et al., 1999) . Most of these studies point to a dual pharmacological action of ARB: a specific effect on respiratory viruses and an immune-stimulating effect, with induction of serum interferon and activation of phagocytes. Studies have also been conducted in children suffering from flu and other acute viral respiratory diseases (Beliaev et al., 1996; Drinevskii et al., 1998) . The latter study -and most documented one -was conducted on 158 children of 1-14 years old, infected with influenza A or B or both or with other respiratory viruses. Over a 5-day treatment, ARB was efficient at reducing the duration of infection and the occurrence of complications, and its immunomodulating action was again suggested. In 2002, Masterlek™, the company currently marketing ARB, sponsored a vast clinical trial conducted on 500 children from 6 to over 12 years old. ARB was given (i) either in prophylaxis twice a week for 3 weeks or once daily for 12 days; (ii) or in treatment thrice daily for 3 days. In all cases, ARB treatment led to a significant reduction of the duration of clinical signs, with no observed adverse effect or complications; see: http://arbidol.org/arbidol-childrens-study.pdf.Interestingly, in studies comparing antivirals, most viral strains were sensitive to ARB, whereas several resistant variants were found with rimantadine (cf also the recent Iatsyshina et al., 2010; L'vov et al., 2013 ) (see also Section 7.).Since 2004, ARB is also patented by Masterlek™ for its medicinal use as an antiviral agent against atypical pneumonia induced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV); see: http://www.arbidol.org/arbidol-patent-2004-sars-russian.pdf Most recently, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase IV clinical trial has been launched by Pharmstandard/Mas-terlek™, to assess whether ARB is effective in the treatment and prophylaxis of flu and common cold: http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ NCT01651663?term=arbidol&rank=1. Two dosages will be evaluated: 800 mg/day for 5 days, or 200 mg/day for 10 days. Completion of this study is expected in 2015.Apart from this recent trial and in spite of an abundance of studies in the 1990s, the overall language barrier renders difficult the precise evaluation of the number of subjects enrolled per study, the way clinical trials were designed, and subsequent statistical analyses performed. Moreover, an official Russian site exists for arbidol (arbidol.ru), where more information could be collected; but no English translation is available.As to studies specifically addressing ARB toxicity issues, initial literature is mostly in Russian, when available. Acute toxicity data report oral LD50s of 340-400 mg/kg in mice, and >3000 mg/kg in rats and guinea pigs: http://img1.guidechem.com/msdspdf/131707-23-8.pdf; Glushkov, 1992. These values are also reported elsewhere: http://arbidol.org/pre-1990-animal-human-test-results.pdf; http://arbidol.org/rat.html; (Loginova et al., 2009; Shi et al., 2007) . Administered intravenously, ARB exhibited LD 50 s of 109 mg/kg in mice and 140 mg/kg in rats (Eropkin et al., 2009 ). On long-term per os administration of ARB in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits or dogs from 2 to over 6 months (with doses ranging from 25 to 125 mg/ kg), no pathological changes were observed in animals. These doses would roughly correspond to 10-to 50-fold the therapeutic doses in humans.ARB is also reported not to induce embryo toxicity in pregnant female rats, nor alter the reproductive function of animals, over a 20 day-administration period of 500 mg/kg doses (http://arbidol.org/rat.html). Recent data from a Chinese group showed a good tolerability of ARB administered to rats per os, at daily doses ranging from 80 to 320 mg/kg over a 4-week period (Wang et al., 2010) . But in fact this study assessed the toxicity of a 1:2.5 combination of ARB with acetaminophen, which renders difficult to precisely evaluate the toxicity of each molecule individually. In healthy male volunteers receiving a single 200 mg-dose of ARB, an excellent tolerability was reported .From these data, it appears that ARB is a well-tolerated molecule with a high therapeutic index, when administered on periods ranging from a few days to a month. To date, however, no studies have addressed the long-term administration of ARB, for example in the context of chronic infections.  ARB bioavailability, pharmacokinetics and metabolism  As an indole derivative, ARB is expected to be poorly soluble in aqueous media. This is of major repercussion on its bioavailability, forms of administration and pharmacokinetics. Efforts to improve ARB water solubility were undertaken, through the chemical grafting of acrylamide polymers to the ARB molecule (Eropkin et al., 2009) . Antiviral properties of these complexes were maintained compared to the parent molecule. They also displayed a better in vitro pharmacological index than ARB, defined as IC 50 /VIC 50 (VIC, virus-inhibiting concentration). However these polymers were not further developed. ARB is soluble in hot glycerol, where it remains soluble down to 23°C. It can then be diluted into aqueous media and administered in vitro or in vivo (Brooks et al., 2012) . However no pharmacokinetic nor metabolite studies were performed from this mode of administration.A very selective, sensitive and accurate method of detection of ARB from human plasma by high-pressure liquid chromatography was designed, and allowed to conclude that no interference existed between ARB and its expected metabolites (Metz et al., 1998) . Studies based upon this HPLC method then evaluated the pharmacokinetic parameters of ARB after oral or intravenous administration in rats. Comparable plasma elimination half-lives (t 1/2 ) and maximum concentrations (C max ) were obtained for oral doses six times higher than those injected; however this was only performed on a small number of animals (Liu et al., 2007a) . The drug is manufactured in Russia and China as tablets or capsules, each containing ARB as its active ingredient. Initial Russian studies in humans revealed that the main site of ARB metabolism is the liver. ARB was rapidly distributed in tissues and organs with maximal accumulation in liver (3.1% w/w), pituitary gland, kidneys, lymphatic nodes and thyroid, adrenal gland, bone marrow, lungs, plasma, thymus and spleen (less than 1% each) (Glushkov, 1992) ; see: http://www.chemeurope.com/en/encyclopedia/Arbidol.html.Plasma C max was reached within 1 h or 1.5 h after a 50 mgor 100 mg-dose, respectively, and t 1/2 was between 17 and 21 h. About 40% of the total intake dose of ARB was excreted unchanged within 48 h via feces. More recent studies reported much shorter plasma C max and t 1/2 in Chinese healthy volunteers, concluding that Russian and Chinese populations differed in ARB elimination rates (Liu et al., 2007b ). However doses administered differed, and technological improvements, especially in detection sensitivity, might also explain such discrepancies. Single doses of 200 mg of ARB administered to healthy volunteers from dispersible tablets or capsules were found bioequivalent and well tolerated . Pharmacokinetics of oral single vs multiple doses of ARB were compared in healthy subjects, from plasma samples analyzed by HPLC (Metz et al., 1998; Sun et al., 2013) . C max increased linearly with the intake dose for single dose administrations, peaking at 2.16 lg/ml for a 800 mg-dose (Sun et al., 2013) . ARB exhibited little accumulation with repeated doses, and the pharmacokinetic profile differed from that observed after single dosage.Based on ARB's chemical structure, several metabolites can be predicted ( Fig. 1A) : oxidation at the sulfur atom, loss of the 4-(dimethylamino)methyle group and N-demethylation, conjugation at the 5-hydroxyl moiety. In a pioneering study in rat urine, the formation of sulfone and sulfoxide forms was confirmed after HPLC, from an oral administration of an ARB/starch suspension (Anisimova et al., 1995) . Glucuronide or sulfate conjugations were also observed at position 5, and after demethylation of the (dimethylamino)methyle group (see also Liu et al., 2012) . In human urine, after administration of a single 300 mg-dose of ARB to healthy subjects, 17 metabolites could be identified, of which the major ones were ARB glucuronide and sulfoxide-ARB (or sulfinyl-ARB; Fig. 1B ) glucuronide (Wang et al., 2008) . Similar metabolites as identified in rats were observed.ARB could also be glucuronidated in vitro, using purified human liver microsomes; this study also revealed that the microsomal (recombinant) UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase (UGT) 1A9 was the major UGT isoform involved in ARB glucuronidation (Song et al., 2013) . Conversely, ARB was found to inhibit UGT1A9 (ibid.; Liu et al., 2013) . Since UGT1A9 is involved in the metabolism of several drugs (e.g. acetominophen, diclofenac), potential drug-drug interactions that could lead to adverse effects should be carefully examined if ARB is administered with other molecules. A more complete picture could be obtained from a study in healthy volunteers receiving a single oral dose of 200 mg ARB, where urine, feces and plasma metabolites were analyzed (Deng et al., 2013) . Most of the metabolites were sulfoxidated, dimethylamine N-demethylated, glucuronide-or sulfate-conjugated. About 32.4% of the total intake dose of ARB was excreted unchanged via feces, as previously reported (Boriskin et al., 2008) . Sulfinyl-ARB ( Fig. 1B) was the major circulating component detected in plasma, followed by unmetabolized ARB, N-demethyl-sulfinyl-ARB and sulfonyl-ARB ( Fig. 1C ). Urine samples contained mainly glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In vitro experiments using human liver, intestine and kidney microsomes, and recombinant enzymes, showed that ARB was metabolized by human microsomes from liver and intestines but not from kidney. In these organs, CYP3A4 was identified as a key metabolic enzyme of ARB.Still, questions remain about the pharmacokinetic properties of ARB metabolites and their potential antiviral activity. The following parameters were reported (Deng et al., 2013) : tmax for ARB and dimethylamine N-demethylated ARB were comparable (1.4 and 1.5 h, respectively), while it was much longer for sulfinyland sulfonyl-ARB (13 and 19 h). Plasma elimination half-lives (t 1/ 2 ) of all metabolites were longer than that of ARB (26.3, 25, 25.7 and 15.7 h for N-demethylated, sulfinyl-, sulfonyl-ARB and ARB, respectively). Exposure to metabolites is therefore greater than that to ARB, and the main metabolite, sulfinyl-ARB, is expected to accumulate on repeated ARB doses. Along these lines, sulfinyl-ARB was reported to contribute for some of the pharmacological activities associated with ARB, and sulfonyl-ARB could inhibit protein kinase C ([IC50] = 7.78 lM) (Demin et al., 2010) . Therefore the potency and duration effect for the agent may be underestimated by measuring only ARB concentrations.It is also predictable, based upon in vitro data with microsomes, that some of the in vivo metabolites could occur in cell cultures, especially in studies addressing the antiviral effect of ARB on hepatotropic viruses using liver-derived cell lines. This could explain why ARB demonstrated greater efficacy under pre-incubation conditions, where metabolites could already be produced and exert specific effects (see below Section 4.). However, a recent study directly addressing the in vitro antiviral properties of sulfinyland sulfonyl-ARB against the Chikungunya alphavirus showed only moderate to weak activity as compared to that of the parent molecule (Delogu et al., 2011) . This was reinforced by the observation that pre-incubation of cells with ARB prior to infection did not improve antiviral effect, pointing to a minor role (if any) of ARB metabolites against Chikungunya infection, at least in vitro. In any case, further investigations will be necessary to: (i) understand the importance of metabolites in the efficacy and safety of ARB, due to their high plasma exposure and long elimination half-lives; (ii) assess their stability in circulation, tissue binding and storage properties.  Broad-spectrum antiviral activity of ARB  ARB has been shown to display antiviral in vitro and/or in vivo activity against a number of enveloped or non-enveloped RNA or DNA viruses, including influenza viruses A, B and C , respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV, adenovirus, parainfluenza type 5, poliovirus 1, rhinovirus 14, coxsackievirus B5, hantaan virus, Chikungunya virus, HBV and HCV [reviewed in Boriskin et al. (2008) , Brooks et al. (2004 Brooks et al. ( , 2012 , Liu et al. (2013a) ] (see also Table 1 ).  Respiratory viruses  Numerous reports in Russian describe the antiviral potency of ARB against human or avian influenza A viruses, and notably the highly pathogenic H5N1 Leneva and Shuster, 2006) and the pandemic 2009 H1N1 subtype (Fediakina et al., 2011) . In vitro studies report IC50s in the 2.5-16 lM range, and state an effect of ARB comparable to that of ribavirin, but superior to that of rimantadine, with rimantadine-resistant strains sensitive to ARB Romanovskaia et al., 2009; Leneva et al., 2010; Fediakina et al., 2011) . A few studies state a potentiating effect of ARB and rimantadine (or amantadine) on influenza A and B viruses Burtseva et al., 2007) . However adamantane antivirals are scarcely used against influenza viruses, due to low barrier to resistance. In these studies, accessible information does not allow to evaluate the stage of the viral life cycle targeted by ARB nor its mode of action. Shi and coworkers showed a greater inhibitory effect on influenza A H1N1 when ARB was added before infection or when it was pre-incubated with the virus (Shi et al., 2007) , suggesting that membrane impregnation and/or metabolites could underlie ARB antiviral activity (see Section 6.). ARB demonstrated similar in vitro antiviral activity as the reference drug ribavirin (Virazole Ò ) against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), an enveloped virus of the Paramyxoviridae family (Leneva et al., 2002) . ARB was most efficient when added before infection (Shi et al., 2007) , with an IC50 of 16 lM.Recently, Tannock and coworkers reported a potent antiviral activity of ARB on several virus families responsible of respiratory infections in animals and humans, in particular on influenza A H3N2 (IC50 12 lM), and the non-enveloped Picornaviridae poliovirus 1 and rhinovirus 14 (Brooks et al., 2012 ; see also Brooks et al., 2004) . Concerning RSV, only a reduction in plaque size and not in number could be observed, hampering the estimation of an IC50. In this study, ARB was added to cells as an aqueous glycerol solution, instead of the classical dilution from DMSO in other studies (Leneva et al., 2002; Shi et al., 2007) . This might explain the discrepancy of antiviral effect on RSV.ARB also displayed an inhibitory effect on the coxsackievirus B5, another member of the Picornaviridae family responsible for a variety of pathologies including respiratory infections, myocarditis or encephalitis . ARB was most active on the virus itself (virucidal test) or when added after infection, through the inhibition of late stages of viral replication. Indeed it was shown to prevent the viral RNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal effect obtained at 5 lM.One study in Russian describes in vitro antiviral activity of ARB against the SARS-CoV, when added after viral infection and at high concentration (95 lM) (Khamitov et al., 2008) . Depending on the cell type, ARB CC50 was reported to vary between 20 and 200 lM (e.g. Boriskin et al., 2006; Brancato et al., 2013; Brooks et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2007) . The dose exhibiting anti-SARS-CoV activity may likely be cytotoxic.Studies conducted on mouse-adapted flu models showed that ARB was effective when administered orally at doses from 15 to 30 mg/kg Leneva et al., 2010) , or up to 100 mg/kg (Shi et al., 2007) , especially when given in prophylaxis before infection. Extrapolated to humans, these doses would correspond to 1-6 g per day, not evaluated clinically in terms of safety.Recently, ARB was found to be effective in vivo against two influenza A H1N1 strains, responsible for seasonal or pandemic flu (Liu et al., 2013b) . Reductions in lung viral titers and lesions were observed for oral doses of 90-180 mg/kg/day, and secretion of lung and macrophage cytokines was modulated, indicating an inhibitory effect of ARB on virus-induced inflammation. However, no effect on interferon-alpha was observed, in line with (Brooks et al., 2012) but contrary to initial reports (Glushkov, 1992) . Brooks et al. (2012) reported a minor effect of ARB on flu A-infected mice at doses from 2 to 50 mg/kg/day. Discrepancies between results from different groups might come from: (i) bioavailability issues, due to differences in solvents used to solubilize ARB (DMSO vs glycerol); (ii) animal models of flu, using viruses and viral strains adapted or not adapted to mice; (iii) doses administered to animals. However, an overall anti-flu effect of ARB in vivo seems apparent.Mice with RSV-induced pneumonia were responsive to ARB at 10-50 mg/kg/day doses, with an observable but not significant reduction in lung infectious titers as compared to untreated animals (Brooks et al., 2012) . While this study points to a potential promising effect of ARB against RSV in vivo, the limited of global studies addressing the effect of ARB against RSV should invite moderation and a call for additional studies.One study addressed the antiviral effect of ARB in mice infected with the coxsackievirus B5 . Mice developed interstitial pneumonia and myocarditis, and some received ARB orally for 6 days. At a dose of 50 mg/kg, the drug prolonged survival and reduced viral propagation in lungs and heart. Although this result completes the picture of the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of ARB, it must again be taken with caution, since it is the sole study on this virus, conducted on a small number of animals and with a high dose of ARB.  Viruses causing hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis  Recently, Chinese studies demonstrated antiviral activity of ARB against the Hantaan virus, an enveloped virus from the Bunyaviridae family Wei et al., 2013) , causing an often lethal hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). In vitro, ARB was more efficient when added before infection, with an IC50 in the 2 lM range. A direct virucidal effect was noted only for ARB concentrations over 15 lM. In vivo, it was able to increase the survival rate, reduce histopathological changes and viral loads in the lethal model of intracranially-infected suckling mice. Also, serum levels of TNF-alpha were modulated. Since these studies were performed by only one research group, with a limited number of animals, they should be reproduced by others before concluding to a beneficial effect of ARB against hantavirus infection. However ARB efficacy compared well in vivo with that of ribavirin, the reference treatment for such a disease (Wei et al., 2013) .Viruses from the Rhabdoviridae family are known to induce neurological disorders, encephalitis or, more recently reported, hemorrhagic fever (Grard et al., 2012) . The only study addressing the effect of ARB against a virus of this family was conducted in our laboratory on the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Blaising et al., 2013) . This enveloped RNA virus mainly infects cattle and pigs, causing oral lesions, anorexia and lethargy. ARB was shown to inhibit in vitro VSV infection in a very similar concentration range as that already shown to affect influenza A or RSV infection [IC50 of 14 (Blaising et al., 2013) , 12 (Brooks et al., 2012) or 16 lM (Shi et al., 2007) , respectively]. Again, ARB displayed optimal antiviral activity when incubated with cells before infection.  Non-enveloped Reoviridae  This family of double-stranded RNA viruses comprises animal and human pathogens, such as the rotavirus, a major agent of (2007), Teissier et al. (2011) gastroenteritis in children. We recently addressed the potential of ARB against the mammalian reovirus T1L strain (Blaising et al., 2013) . This virus is a prototypic member of the Orthoreovirus genus, which infects a wide variety of host species without causing a significant pathology in humans. In spite of this, reovirus has proven to be a useful model for studying viral pathogenesis. In vitro, ARB inhibited reovirus infection in the 10 lM range, but interestingly, did not exert any effect on infectious subvirion particles (ISVPs), intermediates of reovirus infection (Chandran et al., 2002) that could also directly infect cells via a different entry mechanism from that of reovirus (Martinez et al., 1996) . This points to the molecular mechanisms of action of ARB (detailed in Section 6.).  Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection  This alphavirus is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus from the Togaviridae family, loosely related to Flaviviridae (see below HCV). It is responsible for recent outbreaks of a rheumatological disease. Some neurological complications were described, together with meningo-encephalitis. ARB demonstrated potent in vitro activity against CHIKV infection (Delogu et al., 2011) . ARB did not show virucidal activity, contrary to data on respiratory viruses (Shi et al., 2007; Zhong et al., 2009) , and displayed the highest efficiency when preincubated with cells 24 h before infection (IC50 7.5 lM). In this study, the main metabolites sulfinyl-and sulfonyl-ARB were assayed and exhibited only weak antiviral activity, with IC50s > 55 lM. ARB activity was not improved when a 12 h-preincubation with cells was performed, suggesting that metabolites or degradation products are not responsible for ARB antiviral action. Taken together, these results suggest an interference of the parent molecule ARB with early steps of the viral life cycle, such as cell binding and entry.  Hepatitis viruses  ARB and derivatives demonstrated in vitro efficiency against the hepatitis B virus (HBV), an enveloped DNA virus from the Hepadnaviridae family Zhao et al., 2006) . ARB prevented HBV DNA replication with an IC50 of 45 lM, and reduced the production of the virion surface antigen HBsAg at 90 lM; however the 50% cytotoxic concentration was 140 lM, suggesting that inhibitory concentrations are most likely cytotoxic. This work will be further discussed below in the section structure/activity relationship (SAR; Section 5.).We showed that ARB exerts in vitro antiviral activity against the hepatitis C virus (HCV) (reviewed in Boriskin et al. (2008) ), a member of the Flaviviridae family of enveloped viruses. More specifically, ARB was most efficient when incubated with cells before infection and left during infection (Pécheur et al., 2007) . As already shown with other viruses, ARB also displayed virucidal activity (Haid et al., 2009; Pécheur et al., 2007) . In the 10 lM range, ARB inhibited HCV entry, fusion in in vitro and in cellulo studies (Blaising et al., 2013; Haid et al., 2009; Teissier et al., 2011) , and replication on longer times of cell treatment (Boriskin et al., 2006; Sellitto et al., 2010) . However, as previously reported in the case of influenza A infection in vivo (Brooks et al., 2012) , ARB was not found to induce interferon antiviral responses in vitro against HCV (Boriskin et al., 2006) . From these studies, ARB molecular mechanisms of action were proposed (see Section 6 below).  ARB structure-activity relationship (SAR)  Several studies aimed at gaining a better understanding of the structural features of ARB important for its broad antiviral activity, improving ARB therapeutic index, or identifying novel lead compounds active against emergent viruses. Compounds derived from the chemical structure of ARB were synthesized and assayed against various influenza A and B viruses (Brancato et al., 2013) . The amine in position 4 and the hydroxyl moiety in position 5 were found important for ARB antiviral action, whereas the presence or absence of Br in position 6 had little effect (see Fig. 1A ). Insertion of a methyl group between the indole ring and 5-hydroxyl considerably increased antiviral potency of the resulting compound. This molecule was shown to directly bind HA2, with a greater affinity than ARB.The presence or absence of the 6-Bromo group had also no influence on HBV or HCV infections (Sellitto et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2006) . More specifically, the introduction of particular azote-based heterocyclic groups at position 4 improved anti-HBV activity , while it had little effect against HCV (Sellitto et al., 2010) . Replacement of the S-phenyl group at position 2 by a phenyl-sulfonyl decreased the cytotoxicity and increased the anti-HBV activity of the compound Zhao et al., 2006) , while removal of this group was without any influence against HCV (Sellitto et al., 2010) . The 5-hydroxy group was found dispensable against HCV. Thus, it appears that different substituents of the ARB molecule play a role in the antiviral activity, depending on the virus considered, the cellular model used and the test conditions.The combination of in vitro, in cellulo and in silico analyses will help refine the SAR of ARB. In particular, in silico molecular docking studies allowed the precise identification of amino-acid(s) involved in ARB (or derivative) interaction with HA2 (Nasser et al., 2013) . Also, three-dimensional quantitative SAR (3D-QSAR) helped design novel anti-HBV compounds based upon a 5-hydroxy-1H-indole-3-carboxylate skeleton, and predict their antiviral potency (Chai et al., 2011) . This type of approach is also now conceivable to study the potential interactions of ARB with HCV envelope glycoproteins and clarify structural requirements for antiviral activity, since the 3D-structure of HCV E2 has recently been released (Kong et al., 2013) .  Molecular mechanisms of ARB antiviral action  ARB's broad-spectrum antiviral activity suggests that the molecule acts on common critical step(s) of virus-cell interactions. Evidence indicates that ARB directly exerts a virucidal effect, and can then be considered as a direct-acting antiviral (DAA). Most studies also report an effect of ARB on one or several stages of the viral life cycle, such as cell entry (attachment, internalization) and replication. ARB could therefore also act as a host-targeting agent (HTA). In the following section, we will examine the mechanisms by which ARB could exert such dual antiviral activity (recapitulated in Table 1 ).  ARB binds to both lipids and protein residues  ARB is an indole-based hydrophobic molecule susceptible to formation of supramolecular arrangements through aromatic stacking interactions with selective amino-acid residues of proteins (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan). By liquid-state NMR analysis, we showed that ARB displays interfacial properties and intercalates in the shallow layer above the glycerol backbone of phospholipids (Teissier et al., 2011) . It is even conceivable that ARB could locally become more concentrated in viral or cellular membranes.It was also shown that ARB interacts with aromatic residues within the viral glycoprotein involved in membrane interactions and destabilization necessary for fusion, aka the fusion protein (Leneva et al., 2009 for influenza hemagglutinin; Teissier et al., 2011 for HCV E2) . This could therefore underlie the virucidal (DAA) effect of ARB, interacting with the viral lipid envelope and/ or with key residues within structural proteins of virions (required for cellular receptor/captor recognition and/or membrane fusion). This effect has been described for enveloped [influenza A H1N1 virus (Shi et al., 2007) ; Hantaan virus ; HCV (Haid et al., 2009; Pécheur et al., 2007) ] and non-enveloped viruses [coxsackie virus B5 , consistent with ARB's dual physico-chemical properties. ARB could also locally impair viral attachment to cell plasma membrane by stabilizing the membrane, and/or by masking key residues in a viral protein involved in receptor recognition, in a sort of DAA + HTA effect. This would have consequences on viral entry.As shown by fluorescence spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance analyses, ARB affinity for lipid membranes is even more pronounced at acidic pH, the optimal pH for the fusion step of several enveloped viruses, influenza viruses and HCV in particular (Fig. 2) (Haid et al., 2009; Pécheur et al., 2007; Teissier et al., 2010 Teissier et al., , 2011 . This interaction with phospholipids may perturb membrane fluidity, thereby rendering the lipid bilayer less prone to fusion. Inhibition of viral entry and membrane fusion occurred in the 10 lM range, in agreement with ARB affinity for membranes and the concentration range achieved in healthy volunteers (Sun et al., 2013) .Mechanistically, the dual binding capacity of ARB to lipids and proteins might also underlie alterations of protein/protein and/or protein/lipid interactions at other stages of the viral life cycles, such as replication, assembly and budding. For a number of viruses, in particular in the Flaviviridae family, replication occurs in a subcellular compartment called the membranous web (Heaton and Randall, 2011; Moradpour et al., 2007) . The membranous web is an emanation of the endoplasmic reticulum induced by viral proteins such as HCV NS4B (Gouttenoire et al., 2010; Romero-Brey et al., 2012) . Since the web is created and maintained through interactions between viral and cellular proteins and lipids, it is plausible that ARB could impair viral replication through its ability to bind proteins and lipids. Concerning viral assembly and budding, intracellular membranes are obligate partners of nucleocapsids during packaging of enveloped viruses, and for the secretion of newly assembled viral particles. In the case of HCV, viral assembly is concomitant to the assembly of lipoproteins, giving rise to lipo-viro particles (Bartenschlager et al., 2011) . ARB could therefore interfere with these processes through its physico-chemical dual interactions with lipids and proteins.  ARB inhibition of viral entry  Recently, we provided molecular details of how ARB inhibits virus entry into target cells, in a study based on live-cell confocal imaging, using HCV as a model of an enveloped virus (Blaising et al., 2013) (Fig. 2) . First, ARB was found to drastically impede virion attachment to cell plasma membrane. ARB subsequently impaired the release of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) from the plasma membrane, resulting in a slowing of clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) intracellular trafficking. The net result was an intracellular accumulation of CCVs containing trapped virions. ARB was also shown to affect clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) by impeding dynamin-2-induced membrane scission, and thereby CCP formation. Lastly, ARB inhibited fusion between endocytic vesicles and endosomes and hindered viral intracellular trafficking. Virions were not properly delivered to Rab5-positive endosomal compartments where fusion occurs and/or Rab5 was not recruited to virioncontaining vesicles. As a result, fusion was greatly impaired and virions trafficked to endo-lysosomal Lamp-1-positive compartments for degradation.Overall, the data suggest that ARB's dual interactions with lipids and proteins may alter several aspects of intracellular trafficking with and maturation in endosomal compartments. ARB may impede the recruitment and/or disassembly of machineries required for proper endosomal trafficking and viral entry. Thus, ARB inhibition of key actors of intracellular trafficking may be a likely explanation of its broad-spectrum antiviral activity (Table 1 , Fig. 2) , and suggest that ARB acts as an HTA.In most studies, ARB exerted a maximal antiviral effect when used before infection, indicating an activity on early stages of viral infection and/or the requirement for ARB to impregnate cells. In the current state of the literature, ARB was shown to be active against viruses that enter cells by routes requiring at least one of these features: acidification, Rab5, dynamin-2, actin. Reovirus, VSV and HCV hijack CME (respectively: Boulant et al., 2013; Johannsdottir et al., 2009; Meertens et al., 2006) , HBV also most likely enters via this pathway (Yan et al., 2012) . CHIKV entry is mainly achieved via CME (Leung et al., 2011) , but alternative clathrin-independent pathways have been described, dependent upon pH, dynamin-2, Rab5 and actin cytoskeleton integrity (Bernard et al., 2010) .Viruses such as influenza or hantaan can enter through clathrindependent and -independent endocytotic pathways that have acidification in common (reviewed in Mercer and Helenius (2009), Lozach et al. (2010) ). RSV entry is achieved by macropinocytosis and, as shown for HCV, the intracellular trafficking of virions is Rab5-dependent (Krzyzaniak et al., 2013) . In the Picornaviridae family, group B coxsackieviruses entry in epithelial cells occurs via a complex process, combining caveolin-dependent endocytosis with features of macropinocytosis such as dependence upon Rab5 (Coyne et al., 2007) . Also in this family, poliovirus 1 relies on an actin-and tyrosine kinase-dependent endocytic pathway to invade its target cells (Brandenburg et al., 2007) , and rhinovirus 14 entry is pH-dependent and likely achieved by macropinocytosis (Khan et al., 2010) . Concerning SARS-CoV entry, the only consensus feature is its dependence on acidification in internal cell compartments (Inoue et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008) .Apart from lipid membranes, it is therefore conceivable that ARB acts on several cellular targets common to the life cycle of various viruses. Studies directly addressing ARB as an HTA and its interactions with proteins of intracellular trafficking are not available at present, but from our work with HCV, Rab5, dynamin-2 and elements of the clathrin coat could be potential targets (Blaising et al., 2013) . It is also conceivable that elements of the cytoskeleton could be targeted; indeed, molecules based on an aryl-thio-indole skeleton (Fig. 1D) , closely related to ARB chemically, are inhibitors of tubulin polymerization, and thereby potent anticancer agents (La Regina et al., 2013) .  ARB inhibition of viral fusion  ARB was reported to inhibit influenza-and HCV-mediated membrane fusion (Leneva et al., 2009; Teissier et al., 2011) . In vitro studies showed that ARB increases the stability of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and hinders low pH structural reorganizations necessary for HA to adopt its fusiogenic conformation, thus blocking infection at the viral fusion step (Leneva et al., 2009 ; see also below Section 7.). Concerning HCV, fusion inhibition is dosedependent but does not depend on the HCV genotype or on the lipid composition of target membranes (liposomes); it predominantly prevails at low pH (Boriskin et al., 2006; Haid et al., 2009; Pécheur et al., 2007; Teissier et al., 2011) . ARB was found to directly interact with peptides from the HCV E2 glycoprotein (Teissier et al., 2011) and within a pocket of the influenza HA2 subunit of hemagglutinin (Nasser et al., 2013) , thereby exerting its effect as a DAA. Interestingly, these peptides and pocket contain aromatic residues such as tyrosines and tryptophans, which could engage in aromatic stacking interactions with ARB molecules, as described above. ARB may therefore inhibit fusion by impairing conformational changes in viral fusion proteins during initiation of fusion (DAA activity) and by increasing membrane rigidity, rendering membranes refractory to the destabilization that is required for fusion (HTA activity).  ARB inhibition of viral replication, assembly and budding  ARB was shown to inhibit HCV replication in replicon systems, i.e. a cell culture context where virus replicates without any production of infectious viral particles (Boriskin et al., 2006; Sellitto et al., 2010) . A progressive decline in both viral protein and RNA expression was observed in ARB-treated cells, and cells could be cured of replicating viral RNA after 10 weeks of ARB treatment (Boriskin et al., 2006) . Since HCV modulates lipid metabolism (Bassendine et al., 2013) and creates a lipid-rich internal membrane environment favorable for virus replication (i.e. the membranous web), ARB could therefore impregnate these membranes to impede the formation and maintenance of the membranous web and in turn viral replication.CHIKV replication takes place in the host cell cytoplasm and is associated with cytoplasmic membrane alterations (Solignat et al., 2009) . Replication complexes are attached to the membrane of modified endosomes and lysosomes to form organelles characteristic of alphavirus replication called type 1 cytopathic vacuoles.These vacuoles consist in vesicles of 0.6-2.0 lm in diameter harboring numerous spherules (Grimley et al., 1968) , which are positive for lysosomal markers (Kujala et al., 2001) . The vacuoles produce viral RNA until cell death. As already described for HCV, lipid bilayers are therefore essential for CHIKV replication. It is thus plausible that ARB may also impede the formation and stability of these vacuoles, thereby perturbing CHIKV replication.In the absence of studies aimed at addressing the potential interactions between ARB and cellular proteins involved in viral replication, one cannot exclude that such interactions might occur, as already suggested at the viral entry/maturation stage. To date, no report has been made concerning an effect of ARB on viral assembly; however, further investigations are still needed to address this question directly. Concerning viral budding, a recent study supports the notion that ARB could inhibit influenza virus egress because viral RNAs accumulate in cells at later stages of infection (Brooks et al., 2012) . ARB impregnation of cellular membranes and/or the targeting of proteins involved in intracellular trafficking that relate to viral morphogenesis/budding could again underlie this observation.  Viral resistance to ARB  In spite of its usage in Russia and China for several years in flu, ARB does not seem to generate a high degree of viral resistance. Epidemic strains of influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 isolated in Russia in 2008-2009 revealed resistance to oseltamivir and/or rimantadine, but were all sensitive to ARB ). The 2009 pandemic swine influenza A/H1N1 was found largely resistant to rimantadine, but had retained its sensitivity to oseltamivir (Tamiflu Ò ) and ARB (Iatsyshina et al., 2010) . In 2011-2012, influenza A/H3N2 and B viruses were found to be the cause of a vast epidemic in Russia; all tested strains were sensitive to oseltamivir, zanamivir (Relenza Ò ) and arbidol, but resistant to rimantadine (L'vov et al., 2013) .However resistance to ARB of various strains of influenza viruses has been reported, in particular in a population of influenza B . In a study aimed at understanding the anti-influenza mechanism of action of ARB, Leneva and colleagues isolated seven viral mutants from the influenza A/H7N7 ''Weybridge'' strain, that were refractory to ARB doses above 38 lM (Leneva et al., 2009) . All mutants exhibited a single mutation in the HA2 subunit of the influenza hemagglutinin, the subunit involved in membrane fusion. This translated functionally into a 0.2-unit increase in the pH required to induce HA2 conformational changes. ARB was found to directly interact with HA2, thereby increasing its stability to pH and impeding fusion in endosomes during virus infection. Using an elegant proteomic approach, this interaction was further investigated by Nasser and coworkers, and found confined to one peptide encompassing HA2 residues 104-120. This region contains the ARB already identified mutation resistance K117R (Leneva et al., 2009; Nasser et al., 2013) . Taken together, these data reveal that resistance of influenza viruses to ARB mainly arises from mutations in the HA2 fusion protein, consistent with ARB antiviral activity related to membrane fusion.Addressing ARB antiviral mechanism of action against CHIKV, Delogu and coworkers isolated a mutant virus adapted to ARB at 56 lM (Delogu et al., 2011) . This virus was characterized by a single mutation in the E2 viral envelope glycoprotein, in a region most likely involved in cell-surface receptor recognition, and maybe indirectly to membrane fusion. Clearly, additional studies on ARB resistance in the context of other viral infections are warranted.  Conclusion and perspectives  In conclusion, the broad-spectrum activity of ARB may arise through duality of function: a capacity to interact with both membranes and with viral and/or cellular proteins. ARB therefore has features of both a DAA and a HTA. These interactions would impede cellular processes and pathways that are hijacked by several viruses to infect their host cells. Regarding HCV, we have shown that ARB inhibits most steps of HCV entry, from attachment to internalization, until the final step of membrane fusion. ARB also inhibits HCV replication, which may arise via alteration of intracellular membrane-protein structures essential for intracellular trafficking (e.g. clathrin coat components, elements of the cytoskeleton) and virus replication (e.g. membranous web), and could hinder membrane rearrangements necessary for the viral budding step. The broad-spectrum activity and the cellular mechanisms affected by ARB are summarized in Fig. 2 . Through these effects, ARB could display an antiviral activity on viruses that hijack similar cellular pathways or have overlapping life cycles. In particular, endocytosis is used by several viruses and viral families including human immunodeficiency virus (von Kleist et al., 2011) , Adenoviridae, Arenaviridae, Coronaviridae, Togaviridae to achieve productive infection (Table 1) . Moreover, all positive-strand RNA viruses of eukaryotes are known to reorganize intracellular membranes to create specific virus replication organelles. For these reasons, efforts should be pursued in order to determine the potential inhibitory effect of ARB on a large class of viruses. A better understanding of its molecular mechanisms of action would also contribute to refine the conditions at which it could be given in long-term regimens against chronic infections (e.g. hepatitis B or C). Indeed current data on toxicity issues are insufficient to evaluate the safety of ARB in chronic administration. Nevertheless, most studies point to a good tolerability of this molecule. In the present state of our knowledge, ARB could therefore constitute a cost-effective pharmacological approach, affordable for emerging countries in urgent need for effective antiviral therapies.  			1		1			
25794961	Impedimetric cell-based biosensor for real-time monitoring of cytopathic effects induced by dengue viruses	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126431/	Abstract We describe an impedimetric cell-based biosensor constructed from poly-l-lysine (PLL)-modified screen-printed carbon electrode for real-time monitoring of dengue virus (DENV) infection of surface-immobilized baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) fibroblast cells. Cytopathic effects (CPE) induced by DENV-2 New Guinea C strain (including degenerative morphological changes, detachment, membrane degradation and death of host cells), were reflected by drastic decrease in impedance signal response detected as early as ~30 hours post-infection (hpi). In contrast, distinct CPE by conventional microscopy was evident only at ~72hpi at the corresponding multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. A parameter that describes the kinetics of cytopathogenesis, CIT50, which refers to the time taken for 50% reduction in impedance signal response, revealed an inverse linear relationship with virus titer and MOI. CIT50 values were also delayed by 31.5h for each order of magnitude decrease in MOI. Therefore, based on the analysis of CIT50, the virus titer of a given sample can be determined from the measured impedance signal response. Furthermore, consistent impedance results were also obtained with clinical isolates of the four DENV serotypes verified by RT-PCR and cycle sequencing. This impedimetric cell-based biosensor represents a label-free and continuous approach for the dynamic measurement of cellular responses toward DENV infection, and for detecting the presence of infectious viral particles.	Introduction  In recent decades, outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging diseases caused by infectious viruses such as dengue virus (DENV), ebola virus, influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and West Nile virus pose ongoing threats to global biosecurity. In confronting these infectious diseases that spread well beyond the initial affected regions, their surveillance and control often create serious challenges for public health organizations. Hence, the development of rapid, effective and safe virus detection tools has become a major priority of the global community. Current clinical laboratory virus detection tests based on real-time and multiplex PCR techniques, provide a promising platform for simultaneous nucleic acid amplification and detection of multiple target sequences in a single test (Caliendo, 2011; Gullett and Nolte, 2015) . However, these molecular techniques are incapable of identifying live infectious viral particles since they detect the nucleic acids originating from both infectious and noninfectious viruses. Virus samples usually comprise high viral particle-to-plaque-forming unit or PFU ratio , which may indicate that the minority of viruses in a given sample is infectious, or the presence of non-infectious viruses with mutated or damaged genomes, or failure of most of the viruses to successfully infect due to the complexity of the infection cycle (van der Schaar et al., 2007) . Proof of infectious viral particles is highly important and can only be accomplished by conventional cell culture assays, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Clearly, it is essential to develop an effective and simple virus detection tool for the assessment of virulence and identification of infectious viral particles to aid in the control of an epidemic.The electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) technique has recently gained popularity in cell-based assays in view of advantages such as high sensitivity, non-invasive measurement, accessibility of time-dependent and quantitative data. Cell-based assays using adherent mammalian cell cultures such as fibroblast and endothelial cells have been utilized in toxicological and virological studies (Peters et al., 2012; Hofmann et al., 2013) . Since the first reported application of EIS in cell culture study (Giaever Contents and Keese, 1984) , this technique has been widely employed for in vitro monitoring of dynamic responses of cells toward drugs, toxic agents and pathogens (Kiilerich-Pedersen et al., 2011; Asphahani et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2012) . Principally, the EIS cell-based analytical system involves quantitative monitoring of the spreading, morphology and viability of adhered cell cultures in real-time, by applying a constant alternating current (AC) electric field. Due to the low conductivity of cellular membrane, formation of a confluent cell monolayer on the electrode surface often constricts current flow. The corresponding change in impedance signal response can be continuously monitored to obtain information on cellular growth or coverage on the electrode surface (Cheung et al., 2005) . Ultrasensitive impedimetric methods have recently reported non-invasive cell-based analyses of viral infections including herpes simplex virus infection of Vero cells (Cho et al., 2007) , human cytomegalovirus infection of human fibroblasts (Kiilerich-Pedersen et al., 2011) , and bluetongue virus infection of bovine endothelial cells (Drew et al., 2010) . The direct, real-time investigation of DENV-induced cytopathogenesis in mammalian fibroblast cells using the EIS cell-based analytical system is first reported in this study.Mosquito-borne dengue infections are caused by single-stranded RNA-containing DENV which is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. DENV exists as four antigenically distinct serotypes designated DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4 (Teles, 2011) . Among the serotypes, secondary infection with DENV-2 has proven to be responsible for the more severe symptoms of dengue fever (Vaughn et al., 2000) . Invasion of host cells by lytic viruses such as DENV will ultimately result in degenerative changes and damage to host cells, known as cytopathic or cytopathogenic effects (CPE). Such effects are generally characterized by degenerative morphological changes, detachment, membrane degradation and eventual death of cells. In general, decreased tight junctions between cells, and increased separation between cells and electrode arising from CPE may lead to decreased impedance signal response. In comparison to conventional inspection methods such as microscopy and plaque assay that rely on observable changes in the morphology and surface coverage of cells, the EIS technique offers a more promising platform for studying virus-host interactions based on the real-time measurement of CPE-induced impedance response (Cho et al., 2007) .Here we report an impedimetric cell-based biosensor constructed from poly-L-lysine (PLL)-modified screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) for real-time monitoring of DENV infection of surface-immobilized baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) fibroblast cells. This in vitro method in which the cell-based biosensor is immersed in the culture medium, detects viral-induced CPE by gradual decrease in the impedance response. The sensitivity of the biosensing system is enhanced using SPCE, which constricts the current to flow within a small area of working electrode (Campbell et al., 2007; Alonso-Lomillo et al., 2010) . Furthermore, adherence of a cationic polymeric film (PLL) onto SPCE significantly improves the attachment and spreading of cells (Mazia et al., 1975; Sanders et al., 1975; Frey and Corn, 1996; Carrier and Pézolet, 1984; Khademhosseini et al., 2004; Sitterley, 2008) . The excellent performance in terms of rapid detection time, automated analysis, high sensitivity and capability of indirectly identifying infectious viral particles are some desirable features of this impedimetric cellbased approach in real-time biosensing.  Reagents and materials  SPCE, carbon working electrode, silver pseudo-reference electrode, and platinum auxiliary electrode on ceramic substrate were purchased from DropSens. PLL (MW 70,000-150,000 at 0.01% w/v) and potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) (K 3 Fe(CN) 6 , $ 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Fetal bovine serum (FBS), and Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) without calcium and magnesium were obtained from Biowest. Trypsin-EDTA (10 Â ) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 Â ) were obtained from PAA Laboratories. RPMI-1640 medium was purchased from Thermo Scientific Hyclone. Avicel RC-591 (1.2% solid) was purchased from FMC BioPolymer.  Fabrication of PLL-modified SPCE  10 μL of 0.01% (w/v) sterile-filtered aqueous solution of PLL was applied onto the carbon electrode surface (with an area of 12.6 mm 2 ) and the tip of pipette was used to spread the solution evenly over the entire electrode surface. The electrode was inverted and placed in a drying oven at 80°C for at least 5 min to ensure the transformation of PLL film into the stable β-sheet configuration, and adherence of PLL (at a thickness of 1.05 nm) to the electrode surface (Jordan et al., 1994) . Excess PLL solution was aspirated, and the electrode surface was thoroughly rinsed with sterile ultrapure water. The PLL-modified SPCE was characterized using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in the presence of 1.0 mM Fe(CN) 6 3 À /4 À in 1 Â PBS, pH 7.4 at a scan rate of 100 mV s À 1 and potential range from À 0.8 to 0.8 V.  Culturing and maintenance of BHK-21 cells  BHK-21 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in a T25 tissue culture flask containing 3 mL of growth medium (RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 Â penicillin-streptomycin solution). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . When the cells were 80-90% confluent (after 1-2 days), growth medium was removed from the flask. Cells were washed once with 5 mL of 1 Â DPBS, 3 mL of 1 Â trypsin-EDTA was added, and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 for 5 min until cells detached. The detached cells were flushed, trypsin-EDTA was removed, the cells were subsequently resuspended in 2 mL of growth medium, and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 3 mL of growth medium. BHK-21 cells were propagated at a sub-cultivation ratio of 1:2.  Preparation of DENV stocks  DENV-2 New Guinea C (NGC) strain and four clinical isolates each of DENV serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 were propagated in BHK-21 cells supplemented with maintenance medium (RPMI-1640 supplemented with 5% FBS, 1 Â penicillin-streptomycin). Virus at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 was inoculated, and the tissue culture infectious fluid (TCIF) was harvested 4-5 days upon the observation of CPE. MOI represents the ratio of the number of infectious agents (viruses) to the number of infection targets (cells) adsorbed on the electrode surface. Uninfected cells served as the control. TCIF was subsequently centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant containing viruses was collected and diluted with RPMI-1640 to achieve the desired MOI for viral infection monitoring experiments. Plaque assay using Avicel (1.2%) and crystal violet staining was performed to determine the virus titer expressed as PFU mL À 1 .  Construction of cell-based biosensor and monitoring of DENV-2 infection  The experimental set-up consists of a CHI 750D potentiostat-galvanostat (CH Instruments) with data acquisition software, and a sterilized polypropylene vessel integrated with a PLL-modified SPCE ( Fig. 1 ). Total cell count was ascertained using TC10 Automated Cell Counter (Bio-Rad). Cell suspension with viable cell count of 495% was harvested to obtain a cell concentration of 5 Â 10 5 cells mL À 1 . BHK-21 cells (in 50 μL) were seeded on the PLL-coated carbon electrode surface, and allowed to attach and spread on the electrode surface for approximately 2 h. Thereafter, 10 mL of growth medium was gently added to the vessel. Cells were allowed to proliferate in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO 2 for 18 h. Subsequently, 500 μL of DENV-2 stock solution was added and mixed gently with cell medium. BHK-21 cells infected with DENV-2 at different MOI were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO 2 for another 5 days. Proper sterilization of all apparatus and preparatory work were carried out in an antiseptic environment. The impedimetric properties of cell monolayers before and after viral infection were monitored at 37°C using the EIS technique. Electrochemical impedance spectra were recorded at open circuit potential, frequency of 4 kHz, and excitation amplitude of 10 mV.2.6. RNA isolation, reverse transcription (RT), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and analysis of RT-PCR products of clinical isolates of dengue virusesThe Qiagen RNeasy Kit was employed to isolate total cytoplasmic RNA from TCIF collected from each DENV serotype (at MOI of 0.1) propagated in BHK-21 cells cultured with RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS, and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 for 5 days. Synthesis of cDNA (RT) was carried out using 200 ng of RNA, 200 U of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase (Promega), 10 U of RNase inhibitor, 2 mM of dNTPs, and 0.2 mM each of four downstream primers DSP 1, 2, 3, and 4, and subjected to 42°C for 20 min. PCR was carried out using 100 ng of each cDNA and 0.2 mM each of primers, DSP 1, 2, 3, 4, and DV 1. The PCR cycles consisted of an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles each of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 50°C for 30 s, extension at 72°C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min (Seah et al., 1995a) . PCR products (10 ml each) were electrophoresed for 1 h in 1% agarose gels (in 1 Â TBE) containing SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Life Technologies). Images were obtained using the ChemiDoc MP system (Bio-Rad). The specific PCR products corresponding to DENV serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 were excised and subjected to cycle DNA sequencing using BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit v3.1 and 3130xL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).  Cyclic voltammetric characterization of PLL-modified SPCE  Initially, we added cells to the bare SPCE and observed that the impedance signals were negligible and fluctuating between experiments compared with the baseline signals from the bare SPCE without cells added. The former signals remained unintelligible even when cells on the bare SPCE were infected with DENV (data not shown). These findings alluded to poor attachment of cells to the bare SPCE, which led us to modify the electrode by coating it with PLL to facilitate cell attachment.The carbon working electrode surface of SPCE was modified with a cationic polymeric film (PLL) using a similar method described previously (Anson et al., 1983) . The configuration of PLL in solution changes from random coil to α-helix at about pH 10. Subsequent heating to 80°C promotes the transformation of the PLL film into the β-sheet configuration, which is believed to comprise chains that are partially cross-linked by hydrogen bonding. The cyclic voltammograms of the PLL-modified SPCE obtained in the presence of 1.0 mM Fe(CN) 6 3 À /4 À in 1 Â PBS, pH 7.4 ( Fig. 2(A) ) indicated fairly constant CV peak current responses for 100 repetitive potential cycles with RSD values of 5.71% and 2.90% for anodic and cathodic peak currents, respectively. This excellent stability of current response reflected strong adherence of the PLL film to the carbon working electrode surface. In comparison to other electrode surfaces such as platinum and glassy carbon, PLL has been shown to be more resilient and strongly adhered onto the rough surface of screen-printed carbon (Fogg et al., 1995) . The contrasting behavior of a bare SPCE and a SPCE modified with 0.01% (w/v) PLL toward the redox couple Fe(CN) 6 3 À /4 À is shown in Fig. 2(B) . The cyclic voltammograms of the PLL-modified SPCE exhibited a more reversible current response. Coating of electrode surface with a layer of cationic polymer PLL reduces the electrode overpotential and facilitates the redox reaction of anionic redox probes such as Fe(CN) 6 3 À /4 À at the electrode surface. This enhanced anionic exchange capability of the cationic polymer-modified electrode is indicated by a 60.65% increase in CV peak current response compared to a bare electrode (Fig. 2(B) ).Electrode surface coating methods such as gelatin coating (Campbell et al., 2007) and equilibration with culture medium (McCoy and Wang, 2005; Muller et al., 2011) are commonly employed to promote the attachment and spreading of cells on the electrode surface. Despite their good biocompatibility, the utility of these methods is limited by the instability, weak adherence to the electrode surface, and poor cell capture capability. In this study, the positively charged PLL coating was adopted owing to its excellent cell capture capability and strong adherence to carbon electrode surface. Various studies have documented that adherent cell lines such as fibroblast and endothelial cells possess an overall negative surface charge, which facilitates their adhesion to positively charged surface (Somosy et al., 1986; Singh et al., 1992; Hamdan et al., 2006) . This negative surface charge may be attributed to the carboxylic groups of aspartic and glutamic acid (pKa ¼3.9-4.2) of proteins, carboxylic groups of sialic acid (pKa ¼2.8) of glycoproteins, phosphate groups (pKa¼ 2.0), and sulfate groups (pKa¼ 1.9) of sulphated proteoglycans or glycoproteins (Singh et al., 1992) . Another explanation is that their extracellular matrix is rich in negatively charged glucosaminoglycans (Somosy et al., 1986) , thus suggesting that the observed cell adhesion behavior is mainly electrostatic in nature. The enhanced cationic properties of PLL-modified carbon electrode are therefore responsible for the strong adhesion of BHK-21 cells.  Real-time impedimetric monitoring of DENV infection  In this study, the virus-host interactions between DENV and BHK-21 cells were investigated by the EIS technique. BHK-21 cells constitute a type of adherent fibroblast cells, derived by single-cell isolation from the kidneys of five Syrian golden hamsters, Mesocricetus auratus (Stoker and Macpherson, 1964) . This cell line is susceptible to infection by DENV, vesicular stomatitis virus, reovirus, and human adenovirus. The Bode diagram shown in Fig. 3(A) was generated from EIS spectra recorded at a frequency ranging from 100 Hz to 1 MHz. In the absence of electron mediator or redox probe, the electrode impedance of cells is limited by stray capacitance at high frequency and electrode polarization at low frequency. Moderate frequency (1-10 kHz) is well-suited for probing the cellular morphological changes induced by viral infection or cytotoxicants (McCoy and Wang, 2005; Campbell et al., 2007; Cho et al., 2007) . The intermediate frequency at which the impedance signal was most affected by the change in cellular morphology was $ 4 kHz ( Fig. 3(A) ), where the impedance signals measured between cells prior to virus inoculation and during day 5 of viral infection (at MOI¼5) were considerably different from each other. Thus, the EIS data recorded at 4 kHz appear to provide meaningful results which may correlate with the morphological dynamics of cells and the kinetics of DENV-induced cytopathogenesis. This finding was further extended to the infection monitoring experiments where the impedance readings of cell adhesion and subsequent DENV infection were monitored at 4 kHz every 30 min up to 160 h.Due to the variation of the coating of cells on the electrode surface, the impedance signals of four different cell-based biosensors at 25 hours post-infection (hpi) varied between 355.4 Ω and 508.5 Ω with a RSD of 16.5%. Normalization of the impedance signal response in the presence of virus (Z virus ) against the response derived from the same biosensor in the absence of virus at 0 hpi (Z virus ¼0) yielded a relatively low RSD of 4.6%. Normalization of the impedance signal against the blank signal enhances the reproducibility, precision of results, and avoids the need to calibrate each individual biosensor.The DENV infection process involves several stages: attachment of viral envelope glycoprotein to cellular receptors such as dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), heparin sulfate or cell surface immunoglobulin (Chen et al., 1997; Tassaneetrithep et al., 2003) . After fusion with the plasma membrane, viruses are enveloped in an acidified endocytic vesicle known as endosome, and subsequently release RNA into cytoplasm. Virus replication would eventually trigger membrane degradation and release viral progeny into the extracellular environment. In general, viral invasion of host cells induces a series of intra-and inter-cellular remodeling processes, which ultimately lead to changes in tight junctions between cells, and the distance between cells and electrode. Fig. 3(B) shows the normalized impedance signal response as a function of viral infection time at different MOI. This plot reveals information on the attachment and growth of cells on the electrode surface, morphological dynamics of cells, and kinetics of viral-induced cytopathogenesis. Due to the low conductivity of cell membranes, the flow of moderate frequency current at the cellelectrode or cell-cell interface is sensitively influenced by nanometer changes in the adhesion regions or tight junctions between cells (Cheung et al., 2005) . Thus, a gradual increase in the electrode impedance observed during cell culture indicates that cells are actively propagating and densely populating onto the PLL-modified carbon electrode surface. Impedance signal keeps on increasing after virus inoculation as cells continue to grow until cytopathogenesis induces a series of cellular remodeling processes that influence the morphology and adhesion of cells on the electrode surface. Viral-induced cytopathogenesis often results in severe morphological and physical changes, detachment of cells from surface, and eventual cell death (Campbell et al., 2007) . In Fig. 3(B) , fluctuation of the normalized impedance signal signifies the onset of CPE induced by DENV-2 NGC strain, followed by a drastic reduction in impedance signal response, which could be detected as early as $30 hpi at MOI of 10. Moreover, after the observed CPE, the normalized impedance signal of the cell-based biosensor declined by 50% at $ 69 hpi. Technically, this particular time taken for 50% reduction in the cell impedance response is termed CIT 50, a kinetic parameter typically used to characterize the viral-induced cytopathic events (Fang et al., 2011) . To further characterize the viral-induced cytopathogenesis, CIT 50 was regressed as a function of virus titer in the logarithm of MOI. Fig. 3 (C) displays an inverse linear relationship between virus titers and CIT 50 values (R 2 ¼0.955). The resultant regression indicates that CIT 50 was delayed by 31.5 h for each order of magnitude decrease in MOI. Therefore, the dependence of the CPE-induced impedance signal response on the viral infectious dose permits the estimation of virus titers of viral samples based on the measured impedance signals.  Control and kinetics experiments  Several control experiments were carried out to assess the performance of impedimetric cell-based biosensor for the investigation of virus-host interactions. A control experiment using BHK-21 cells in the absence of DENV (represented by the black line in Fig. 3 (B) produced a gradual increment in impedance signal with time. Clearly, BHK-21 cells cultured in growth medium remain viable and actively propagate on the electrode surface. The normalized impedance signal reaches its maximum after $ 5 days of incubation with growth medium where the electrode surface is fully covered with cells. Another control experiment using a PLLmodified SPCE immersed in growth medium in the absence of BHK-21 cells and DENV gave a fairly constant impedance signal over a period of 6 days (data not shown). Fig. 4 shows the control experiments using different host cells infected with DENV-2 NGC strain at MOI of 5. In the control using biosensor prepared with Vero cells, a commonly used mammalian cell line, the electrode impedance increased initially as the Vero cells grew and reached a plateau from days 3 to 6. Another control using the C6/36 Aedes albopictus mosquito cell line produced a fairly constant impedance signal from days 0 to 5, thus revealing poor attachment and spreading of C6/36 cells on the PLL-modified carbon electrode surface. In summary, DENV-induced CPE could not be observed with Vero and C6/36 cell lines even at a relatively high MOI of 5. This suggests that the impedance response is specific to BHK-21 cells and may not relevant to other cell lines. In summary, decrease in impedance signal could only be detected with the occurrence of DENV-induced cytopathogenesis of the BHK-21 fibroblast cell line.For comparison, DENV-2 NGC-infected BHK-21 cells seeded in a PLL-coated culture flask were observed for CPE using an EVOS FL digital fluorescence microscope (Life Technologies). Microscopic images were taken using a Sony high-sensitivity monochromatic CCD camera, with contrast and brightness adjusted to improve the quality of images. Uninfected BHK-21 cells served as control. Microscopic imaging of BHK-21 cells after 5 days of infection with DENV-2 NGC strain at MOI of 1 displayed typical CPE including considerable changes in cellular morphology. Detachment of cells from the surface was indicated by the presence of many empty spaces and rounded cells instead of the original completely confluent monolayer of spindle-shaped cells as depicted in Fig. 5(A) . On the other hand, the monolayer of densely populated uninfected BHK-21 cells remained virtually intact after 5 days of incubation with growth medium (Fig. 5(B) ).To study the kinetics of CPE of BHK-21 cells infected with DENV-2 NGC at MOI of 1 and 10, monitoring by conventional microscopy was performed at 1, 6, 18, 24, 30, 42, 48, 54, 67, 72, 78, 90, 96, 102, 144 and 174 hpi. BHK-21 cells mock-infected with heat-inactivated DENV-2 NGC at "MOI" of 10, and BHK-21 cells treated with DENV-2 NGC viral RNA served as additional controls. As expected, no CPE was observed for both negative controls up to 174 hpi. However, the earliest distinct microscopic evidence of CPE was observed at 72 and 102 hpi for MOI of 10 and 1, respectively (Supp. Fig.) . In direct comparison to the optical method, the more sensitive cell biosensor could "sense" CPE much earlier as reflected by the drastic reduction in impedance signal response at $30 and $60 hpi for MOI of 10 and 1, respectively.  Analysis of clinical DENV isolates  The potential application of cell-based biosensor in analyzing clinical isolates was examined against four different dengue serotypes, DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4. These viruses were isolated from the respective DENV-infected patients. The four clinical DENV isolates were verified to be DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 strains by RT-PCR and cycle sequencing of amplified products (Seah et al., 1995a) , and their sequences deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers KM586232, KM979356, KP119840. Fig. 6 (A) shows agarose gel electrophoresis of the RT-PCR products of DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4. Their nucleotide sequences exhibit high identities to isolates RR121 (92%), 1046DN/1976 (97%), TB16 (97%), and 475A (99%), respectively. Infection of BHK-21 cells with the four clinical isolates of DENV was monitored by using the procedures described for the NGC strain. Fig. 6 (B) displays similar CPEinduced impedance signals for the four clinical isolates (at MOI of 5). Slight variation in CPE detection time may possibly be attributed to the varying degrees of CPE induced by these clinical DENV strains. In summary, CPE induced by the four clinical isolates of DENV could be detected within 1-2 days post-infection. The performance of this impedimetric cell-based biosensor underscores its utility for the analysis of clinical DENV isolates. Future studies are warranted to evaluate this biosensor for the analysis of actual clinical specimens from dengue patients, e.g. blood samples (Seah et al., 1995b; Phanthanawiboon et al., 2014) .  Conclusions  In conclusion, an impedimetric cell-based biosensor constructed from PLL-modified SPCE has proven to be useful for realtime monitoring of DENV-induced cytopathogenesis on surfaceimmobilized fibroblast cells. Based on this platform, CPE reflected by the drastic decrease in impedance signal response could be detected at $ 30 hpi at MOI of 10. This impedimetric biosensing system outperforms conventional microscopic inspection that requires 3-5 days of DENV infection to conclusively observe the changes in morphology and surface coverage of cells. Other attractive features of this cell-based biosensor include the possibility of automation, non-invasive measurement, reduced timeframe for the diagnosis of live DENV infection, mediatorless and label-free monitoring procedure, and capability of detecting the presence of infectious dengue viral particles to complement existing diagnostic tests such as RT-PCR and serology. In addition, virus titers of given viral samples can be estimated from the measured impedance signals by analysis of CIT 50 values. The utility of this impedimetric cell-based biosensor for detecting clinical infectious viral isolates also demonstrates its potential application in the clinical setting.  				1	1			
26684065	Characterization of a protein tyrosine phosphatase as a host factor promoting baculovirus replication in silkworm, Bombyx mori	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124732/	Abstract The relevance of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) to host–pathogen interaction is highlighted in mammalian studies, whereas less is known in insects. Here we presented the categorization of the PTP complement of silkworm and characterized their homologous relationship with human and fruit fly PTPs. Among the 36 PTP genes, ptp-h, which was proposed to be the origin of baculovirus ptp belongs to atypical VH1-like dual-specific PTP subset and encodes a catalytic active protein. The maximum expression level of Bmptp-h was at 5th instar and in fat body. Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) infection potently induced its expression in silkworm larvae and in BmE cells. Knock-down of Bmptp-h by RNA interference significantly inhibited viral replication, and over-expression enhanced viral replication as determined by viral DNA abundance and BmNPV-GFP positive cells. These results suggest that BmPTP-h might be one of the host factors that is beneficial to baculovirus infection by promoting viral replication.	Introduction  Reversible protein tyrosine phosphorylation provides a potent and versatile mechanism for regulating various physiological processes in eukaryotic cells. Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), which catalyze the transfer of phosphoryl group to tyrosine residues, and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), which remove phosphate moiety from phosphotyrosine residues, work together to modulate signaling pathways. In some cases, PTPs play a dominate role in shaping the spatio-temporal dynamics of protein tyrosine phosphorylation network, making it a pivotal target for functional manipulation (Mustelin et al., 2005) . Although the study of PTPs lagged behind of PTKs for historical reasons and technical difficulties, a large number of PTPs have been discovered in recent years, paralleling PTKs in sequence diversity and functional complexity (Alonso et al., 2004) . Despite a minority reported to be Asp-based PTPs, all others possess at least one signature motif, [I/V] HCX 5 R[S/T] and share a Cys-based catalytic mechanism. Some PTPs serve as pTyr-specific enzymes, others can also dephosphorylate Ser/Thr residues, thus they are operationally defined as dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) . And the ability of removing phosphate group from phospholipid or RNA is also reported in some DUSPs (Tonks, 2013) .Intriguingly, numerous hostevirus interactions are based on the interplay of PTKs and PTPs as revealed by studies on vertebrates and invertebrates (Devasthanam, 2014; Kingsolver et al., 2013) . Mounting a potent immune response to invading virus relies on proper phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of signaling molecules in host cells. Reciprocally, virus develops strategies to utilize or disrupt this regulatory mechanism for survival and transmission. For instance, in vitro studies using mammalian cell lines demonstrated that DUSP1, which dephosphorylates MAPKs, facilitates the infection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Choi et al., 2015; Liao et al., 2011) . And congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can take advantage of CDC25, a cell cycle regulator to promote viral replication (Fu et al., 2015) . However, due to the lack of systematic analysis of insect PTPs and distinct antiviral mechanism that insect may take, few surveys reported the relevance of insect PTPs to antiviral immune response.Some virus also encode PTPs, which have been hypothesized or demonstrated to function as virulence factors that impair host immune response or other functions (Heneberg, 2012; Peters et al., 2002; Provost et al., 2004) . The best-known example in insect is the expression of several bracovirus-encoded PTPs in lepidopteran hosts promoted the apoptosis of granulocytes and inhibited spreading and phagocytosis of plasmatocytes, therefore facilitating parasitoid development (Ibrahim et al., 2007; Ibrahim and Kim, 2008; Pruijssers and Strand, 2007) . Interestingly, phylogenic analysis showed that those PTP genes were acquired from braconid genome and experienced complex evolutionary change Serbielle et al., 2012) . Recent studies on another subset of insect virus identified a nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV)-encoded PTP, which was presumably acquired from a lepidopteran host by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) as an essential factor to induce an enhanced locomotory activity (ELA) in host caterpillars (Kamita et al., 2005; van Houte et al., 2012) . And NPV ptp deletion mutant lost its ability to manipulate its host behavior. Surprisingly, later study found BmNPV PTP functions as a virus-associated structural protein rather than as an enzyme in regard to the induction of ELA, although it still maintains the catalytic activity (Katsuma et al., 2012) . Moreover, BmNPV ptp deletion mutant had reduced progeny production in silkworm larvae and showed a delay in late gene expression in cell lines. An earlier study identified a BmNPV ptp homolog encoded by Autographa californica multicapsid NPV (AcMNPV) as a dual phosphatase containing RNA 5'-triphosphatase activity which is implicated in processing of viral late mRNAs (Takagi et al., 1998) . In contrast to BmNPV ptp mutant, AcMNPV ptp mutant seems to have no defect in replication in insect larvae, but partially defect in occluded virus production in a cell-specific manner (Li and Miller, 1995) .Given that HGT between host and pathogen has been proposed to be an important mechanism to increase pathogen survival and propagation (de la Casa-Esperon, 2012), it is interesting to trace back the function of the host copies to better understand the interaction between the host and pathogen. In the present study, we first analyzed BmPTP-h based on its functional categorization, then we investigated the immune-regulatory role it would play under the challenge of BmNPV in vitro and in vivo. We found that it increased expression level after viral infection and benefited viral replication. Our result provides complementary insights into the molecular machinery exploited by insect virus which could be pursued for antiviral strategy.  PTP identification and classification  Based on the annotated information of Bombyx mori comprehensive gene sets (http://sgp.dna.affrc.go.jp/ComprehensiveGeneSet/), sequence of protein predicted to possess tyrosine phosphatase domain was extracted and analyzed by online software SMART (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/). Protein that contains the PTP signature motif (CX 5 R) was then used as the query in BLASTP search against NCBI sequence repository to identify their paralogs. B. mori PTPs were classified into subfamilies according to their orthologous PTPs in human and fruit fly (Alonso et al., 2004; Hatzihristidis et al., 2015) .  Insect, cells and virus  Silkworm larvae (DaZao P50 strain) were reared on fresh mulberry leaves at 25 C and relative humidity of 80%. BmE cells were maintained at 27 C in Grace medium (Gibco, UK) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone, USA). Wide-type BmNPV (Guangdong strain, China) and recombinant BmNPV-GFP (courtesy of Dr. Xiaofeng Wu, Zhejiang University, China) were propagated in BmE cells and silkworm larvae following the standard procedure. Viral titer were determined by plaque assay in BmE cells (Katsuma et al., 1999) .  Bmptp-h over-expression and RNAi  BmPTP-h-coding sequence (NCBI Gene ID: 692515) was cloned into the pSL1180 expression vector with a Flag tag at the N-terminus using primer set 1 in Table 1 dsRNA to Bmptp-h or red fluorescent protein gene (RFP) (dsBmPTP-h or dsRFP) were in vitro synthesized using T7 RiboMAX Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega, USA) with the primer sets 2 and 4. Plasmids or dsRNA were transfected into BmE cells using X-treme GENE transfection reagent (Roche, Switzerland) following the manufacturer's instruction. dsRNA was injected into silkworm larvae (20 mg/larva) at second day of fifth instar through the second last stoma in abdomen with a fine needle.  Viral infection  For infection of cells, 5000 virions were incubated with 1Â10 6 BmE cells 48 h after transfection. For infection of silkworm larvae, 10 000 virions were injected into silkworm larvae at Day 3 of 5th instar. At different time points after infection as indicated in graph, the expression level of Bmptp-h or BmNPV gp64 was subjected to quantitative PCR analysis.  Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis  Total RNA was extracted from cells or tissue samples using Total RNA Kit (Omega, USA) at different time points post viral infection and qPCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa, Japan) on a StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA) with a program consisting of an initial denaturing step of 30 s at 95 C and 40 amplification cycles consisting of 5 s at 95 C followed by 30 s at 60 C. Bmptp-h and sw22934 were amplified with primer sets 3 and 6 accordingly. For analysis of BmNPV replication, total DNA was extracted from viral infected BmE cells using the Universal Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Takara) as described. BmNPV gp64 and BmGAPDH were amplified with primer sets 5 and 7 respectively. The expression level of Bmptp-h or BmNPV gp64 genes were normalized to the control sw22934 or BmGAPDH. The relative viral abundance was determined as described previously (Jiang et al., 2012) .  Western blotting  Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM TriseHCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40 pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After centrifugation at 17 000 g for 15 min at 4 C, the supernatant was collected on ice for western blot analysis. Concentration of cell lysate was determined by BCA assay. A total of 20 mg protein per sample was resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE. After transfer to PVDF membrane (GE Health Care, USA), samples were immuno-blotted with anti-FLAG mAb or anti-Tubulin mAb (Sigma, USA) following the standard procedure.  Tyrosine phosphatase assay  1Â10 6 BmE cells transfected with BmPTP-h expression vector were solubilized in 200 ml lysis buffer, then pre-cleared and incubated with casein (0.2 mM) for 10 min at 30 C. The reaction was terminated by addition of TCA buffer. After centrifugation at 17 000 g for 10 min, 200 ml supernatant was mixed with 20 ml molydbate dye and liberated phosphate was visualized at 750 nm using a microplate reader (Promega).  Statistical analysis  Data were presented as the mean ± S.D. (n ¼ 3). Statistical significant differences were determined by Student's t-test (for comparison of two means), or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiple comparison test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). ], a few display variations at the first two amino acid residues and one has Gln instead of Ser/Thr at last position which is predicted to be catalytic inactive. Whereas 79 out of the 107 human PTPs are multidomain proteins, less than a half of silkworm PTPs harbor at least one characteristic domain, which may contribute to the specific interaction with regulatory or targeting molecules.  Identification and classification of BmPTPs  Bmptp-h (NCBI Gene ID: 692515), which was proposed to be the origin of BmNPV ptp, encodes an atypical VH1-like DUSP. It is homologous to Drosophila CG13197 and distantly related to human DUSP11, and the latter binds splicing complex and has been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (Hasler et al., 2011; Yuan et al., 1998) . BmPTP-h may also have 5'-triphosphatase activity using RNA as a substrate like DUSP11 (Deshpande et al., 1999) . Clear function of these molecules is unknown.   Expression profile of Bmptp-h during the development and in different tissues  To evaluate the physiological functions of BmPTP-h, we first analyzed its expression profiles at different developmental stages or in different tissues by qPCR. We found the expression level of Bmptp-h increased gradually at larval stage, and it reached the highest level on the 3rd day of fifth instar (I5D3), which was more than 15-times higher than in 1st instar (I1), then decreased afterwards until the end of pupal stage (Fig. 1A) . Next, we examined Bmptp-h transcriptional levels in different tissues dissected from I5D3 larvae (Fig. 1B) . A relative high level of Bmptp-h was detected in the fat body, followed by testes.  Expression profile of Bmptp-h under NPV infection  Since previous studies have shown BmNPV PTP is important for viral productive infection in silkworm larvae and cell line, and BmPTP-h shares 48.2% identity (80.7% similarity) with BmNPV PTP on amino acid sequence (Takagi et al., 1998) , we speculated that BmPTP-h also plays a role in regulating interaction between virus and host. For that reason, we injected NPV virions into I5D3 larvae and investigated the expression profile of Bmptp-h during infection. Although the expression level of Bmptp-h changed over time during the progression, viral infection induced higher level of Bmptp-h transcription compared to the uninfected larvae at the same time point (Fig. 2A) . The expression level of Bmptp-h in uninfected I5D7 larvae (96 h) was lower than that at I5D3 (0 h), which is in accordance with the result shown in Fig. 1A . However, in viral-infected larvae Bmptp-h transcript level was much higher at 96 h. We also found expression of Bmptp-h was potently induced by BmNPV infection in BmE cells after 48 h compared with uninfected cells and increased sharply afterwards (Fig. 2B) .  Effects of Bmptp-h knock-down and over-expression to NPV infection in BmE cells  To test the tyrosine phosphatase activity of BmPTP-h, we expressed a Flag-tagged BmPTP-h in BmE cells (Fig. 3A ), and measured the enzymatic level of cell lysates (Fig. 3B) . Cells expressing Flag-BmPTP-h showed a significant increase in the overall PTP activity level compared to the control, indicating that BmPTP-h is catalytic active and able to regulate the cellular functions via tyrosine dephosphorylation. To investigate whether BmPTP-h is involved in anti-viral response, we performed dsRNAmediated RNAi to deplete the expression of Bmptp-h in BmE cells (Fig. 4A ). About 80% decrease in transcript level was obtained by dsBmPTP-h compared with dsRFP. 48 h after dsRNA transfection, we challenged cells with BmNPV or BmNPV-GFP, and analyzed the viral abundance by qPCR or fluorescence microscopy ( Fig. 4B and C). Replication of viral DNA or the amount of GFP-positive cells was remarkably reduced when Bmptp-h was depleted. We then overexpressed Bmptp-h in BmE cells and measured the susceptibility of these cells to BmNPV or BmNPV-GFP infection (Fig. 5) . Viral replication or GFP-positive cells significantly increased in BmPTPh-overexpressing cells than in control. These results suggest that BmPTP-h promotes viral productive infection in cells.  Effects of Bmptp-h knock-down to NPV infection in vivo  In order to investigate whether depletion of Bmptp-h has any effect to viral infection in vivo, we injected dsRNA into silkworm larvae 12 h before BmNPV infection and measured viral abundance. Since RNAi efficiency might not be the same in different tissues, we dissected several tissues and examined the expression level of Bmptp-h in them separately (Fig. 6A) . With the exception of midgut (data not shown), the relative expression levels of Bmptp-h decreased to 25%e40% after injection of dsRNA targeting Bmptp-h (dsBmPTP-h) compared to the control dsRFP in fat body, trachea and head. Furthermore, in those tissues viral abundance was all significantly decreased (Fig. 6B) , and the reduction was most dramatic at 96 h post infection, suggesting that Bmptp-h silencing might have adverse effect to viral replication in vivo.  Discussion  In this study, we found BmNPV infection induced the expression of BmPTP-h, a dual-specific phosphatase in silkworm larvae and BmE cells. Partial depletion of Bmptp-h by dsRNA inhibited BmNPV replication, and over-expression of Bmptp-h resulted in enhanced viral replication. The results suggest that BmPTP-h might be one of the host factors that are beneficial to the replication of BmNPV. Although RNA interference is considered to be the major antiviral mechanism in insect, induction of immune signaling pathways, including Toll, IMD and JAK-STAT pathways have been observed upon viral infection (Merkling and van Rij, 2013; Sabin et al., 2010; Zambon et al., 2005) . Since the signal transduction largely relies on protein phosphorylation, as a dual-specific phosphatase, BmPTP might be exploited by virus to disrupt the signaling cascades through targeting the phosphorylated molecules, resulting in immunosuppression. Furthermore, since double mutation of NPV lef-4 and NPV ptp, which are the only two viral genes encoding proteins with RNA triphosphatase activity did not alter viral RNA processing, it was proposed that host mRNA-capping enzymes might be involved in viral RNA maturation (Li and Guarino, 2008) . Considering the RNA triphosphatase activity that BmPTP-h possibly possesses, it could also be hijacked by virus for efficient viral RNA synthesis.Identification of host factors important for viral infection, especially for viral replication have been carried out using Drosophila and human cells by genome-wide RNAi screening (Hao et al., 2008; Konig et al., 2010) . Those studies reported that molecules involved in kinase-regulated signaling, ubiquitination and phosphatase activity are enriched in hostepathogen interaction network. However, the mechanism on how virus induces the expression of those "benefit" factors in host is unclear. One hypothesis is that production of viral proteins down-regulates the repressors of those factors in host, such as microRNA, resulting in Fig. 6 . Knock-down of Bmptp-h reduced BmNPV replication in vivo. (A) dsRFP or dsBmPTP-h was injected into silkworm larvae at second day of fifth instar and knock-down efficiency of Bmptp-h was measured in different tissues. (B) 24 h after dsRNA treatment, silkworm larvae were injected with BmNPV. Relative abundance of virus post infection determined by BmNPV gp64 expression level was measured in corresponding tissues. The mRNA level of target genes was normalized to the internal control (sw22934 or BmGAPDH) and represented as mean ± S.D. (n ¼ 3). Statistical significance was assessed using Student's t-test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. increased expression of molecules favoring viral replication (Fu et al., 2015) . A few studies suggested that baculovirus infection leads to an overall suppression of host cellular microRNA (Mehrabadi et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2012) , whether there is a microRNA targeting Bmptp-h needs further identification.It is interesting to note that besides BmNPV ptp, several other baculoviral auxiliary genes are also acquired from host insect genome via horizontal gene transfer (HGT), such as ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt) and fibroblast growth factor (vfgf) (Katsuma et al., 2008) . Although they are dispensable for virus production in cell line, they are reported to be involved in controlling host physiology. No direct evidence is available showing that BmPTP-h is also playing roles in regulating silkworm wandering behavior, however our study demonstrated that it promotes viral replication, facilitating rapid spread throughout the whole body of the silkworm to overwhelm the immune system. In contrast to this "collaboration" strategy employed by baculovirus in the case of BmPTP-h, HGT of host genes usually allows pathogen to compete with hosts for the molecules necessary to maintain physiological integrity or dampen host response by acting as dysfunctional mimics (Liu et al., 1997; Zhao et al., 2014) . Kamita et al. showed inserting Bmptp-h into the BmNPV ptp-deleted virus rescued the inability to induce ELA, but to a much lesser extent than WT virus, suggesting that the modification on BmNVP ptp sequence during evolution may have provided selective advantages and drive their fixation in the viral genome to counteract the host defense.In conclusion, we did a whole genome survey for silkworm PTP gene sets and characterized their homologous relationship with human and fruit fly PTPs. We also found BmPTP-h acts as a host factor facilitating baculovirus infection via promoting its DNA replication. Further understanding of the pathways, in which BmPTP-h participates will provide new insight into the hostevirus interactions that control the viral replication.  					1			
19232845	Epidemiological study of bovine norovirus infection by RT-PCR and a VLP-based antibody ELISA	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117358/	Abstract Noroviruses, belonging to the family Caliciviridae, have been identified in human beings and in several animal species including cattle. The distribution of bovine norovirus infections was investigated by both RT-PCR to detect norovirus genomes and a virus-like particles-based ELISA to detect genotype 2 bovine norovirus antibodies. During a 1-year systematic study, a virus prevalence of 7.5% (CI 95%: [3.7; 13.4%]) (10 out of 133 samples) was found in stool samples from diarrhoeic calves screened by RT-PCR. Nucleotide sequencing performed on the polymerase region classified all the norovirus amplicons in the bovine norovirus genotype 2. Rather surprisingly, some rotavirus sequences were also detected. On the basis of the polymerase region, genotype 1 bovine norovirus was not identified. Other enteropathogens were found in all samples. By ELISA, a genotype 2 seroprevalence of 93.2% (CI 95%: [90.4; 95.3%]) was found from calves and adult cattle. Antibody levels against genotype 2 bovine noroviruses rose in the first 6 months of life and were maintained in adults. Together the results of virus prevalence and seroprevalence studies suggest that bovine norovirus infection occurs early in life and that re-infection with serologically related bovine noroviruses strains could occur in adult cattle as reported for rotaviruses. The antibody rise against genotype 2 bovine noroviruses in the adult cattle also suggests a short lived and/or strain specific immunity as already shown in human noroviruses. Genotype 2 bovine noroviruses are endemic in the region investigated.	Introduction  Noroviruses (NoV) belong to the family Caliciviridae and have been identified in the human being and in several animal species including the bovine (Scipioni et al., 2008b; Green, 2007) . Noroviruses are small, round, non-enveloped viruses, with a 25-40 nm diameter and have a positivesense, single-stranded RNA genome with three open reading frames (ORF). The non-structural proteins, including the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the single capsid protein (VP1) and the minor structural protein are encoded by ORF1, 2 and 3, respectively (Green, 2007) . Ninety dimers of VP1 form the capsid which presents an icosahedral symmetry under electron microscopy (EM). Capsid protein VP1 has a molecular weight of around 55-60 kDa and is organised into two domains: a shell (S) domain (N-terminal part of VP1) and a protruding (P) domain (C-terminal part of VP1) (Prasad et al., 1999) . The P domain supports receptor recognition and immunogenic functions (Lochridge et al., 2005) . Noroviruses are difficult to grow in cell culture but abundant quantities of virus-like particles (VLP) can be obtained by expressing VP1 in the baculovirus protein expression system. These VLP are morphologically and antigenically similar to the native strain (Jiang et al., 1992) .Noroviruses, belonging to the family Caliciviridae, have been identified in human beings and in several animal species including cattle. The distribution of bovine norovirus infections was investigated by both RT-PCR to detect norovirus genomes and a virus-like particles-based ELISA to detect genotype 2 bovine norovirus antibodies. During a 1-year systematic study, a virus prevalence of 7.5% (CI 95%: [3.7; 13.4%]) (10 out of 133 samples) was found in stool samples from diarrhoeic calves screened by RT-PCR. Nucleotide sequencing performed on the polymerase region classified all the norovirus amplicons in the bovine norovirus genotype 2. Rather surprisingly, some rotavirus sequences were also detected. On the basis of the polymerase region, genotype 1 bovine norovirus was not identified. Other enteropathogens were found in all samples. By ELISA, a genotype 2 seroprevalence of 93.2% (CI 95%: [90.4; 95 .3%]) was found from calves and adult cattle. Antibody levels against genotype 2 bovine noroviruses rose in the first 6 months of life and were maintained in adults. Together the results of virus prevalence and seroprevalence studies suggest that bovine norovirus infection occurs early in life and that re-infection with serologically related bovine noroviruses strains could occur in adult cattle as reported for rotaviruses. The antibody rise against genotype 2 bovine noroviruses in the adult cattle also suggests a short lived and/or strain specific immunity as already shown in human noroviruses. Genotype 2 bovine noroviruses are endemic in the region investigated.ß 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Bovine norovirus (BoNoV) prototype strains identified so far are Newbury2 strain (NB2), previously known as Newbury Agent 2, and the Jena virus (JV). The NB2 and JV were identified by EM in the faeces of diarrhoeic calves in 1978 in Great Britain (Woode and Bridger, 1978) and in 1980 in Germany (Gunther and Otto, 1987) . They were later genetically identified as belonging to the genus Norovirus (Liu et al., 1999; Oliver et al., 2003) where all BoNoV strains fall into the genogroup III . Two genotypes are described in the BoNoV genogroup: viruses genetically related to JV were assigned to the genotype 1 and viruses genetically related to NB2 to the genotype 2 .Their relative environmental stability, their main faecal-oral transmission route, their low infectious dose and their large strain diversity increase the risk of cattle infection with these viruses (Green, 2007) . In gnotobiotic calves, BoNoV induce non-hemorrhagic enteritis, mild diarrhoea, transient anorexia and malabsorption (Woode and Bridger, 1978) . But the real impact of these viruses in the field is currently poorly evaluated. The two genotypes of BoNoV were recently shown to be endemic in Great Britain and Germany (Oliver et al., 2007b) . They were also isolated in all continents and thus seem to be widespread (Scipioni et al., 2008b) .In this work, an original combined virological and serological approach was used to characterise the epidemiology of BoNoV infection in cattle. In a first virological approach, the molecular prevalence was investigated in diarrhoeic calf samples during a 1-year study. In a second serological approach, a VLP-based ELISA was developed and the cattle seroprevalence against BoNoV was estimated in the same region. Together the results suggest an association of BoNoV infections with the age of the animals.  Bovine stool samples and genetic analysis  Stool samples from calves aged 1 week to 6 months were systematically received from a Belgian diagnostic laboratory each month through the year 2007. Samples came from different places out of five provinces of Belgium (Hainaut, Namur, Liege, Luxembourg, Walloon Brabant). Their origin was either from diarrhoeic samples (n = 74) submitted for etiologic diagnosis of gastroenteritis or from necropsy samples (n = 59) where gastroenteritis lesions were found. This stool bank (n = 133) was screened by one step RT-PCR for the presence of BoNoV genome sequences with Quick Access kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Four different primer pairs were used to amplify segments of the polymerase gene and the beginning of the capsid region: CBECu (Smiley et al., 2003) , JV12/13 , P289/290 (Jiang et al., 1999) and BEC (Ike et al., 2007) . These primers were selected in order to perform the broadest detection of NoV including a possible zoonotic transmission. Out of the BoNoV specific primers (CBECu and BEC), CBECu pair was seen to detect not only genotypes 2 but also genotypes 1 BoNoV with an apparent sensitivity of about 83% relative to the p289/290 pair in a previous study (Smiley et al., 2003) . RT-PCR program consisted in a reverse transcription step of 45 min at 45 8C followed by the PCR reaction. It consisted in an initial denaturation step of 2 min at 94 8C followed by 40 PCR cycles (30 s denaturation step at 94 8C; 1 min annealing step at 48 8C for CBECu, JV12/13 and BEC primers, 51 8C for p289/290 primers; 2 min extension step at 68 8C) and a final extension step of 10 min at 68 8C. Positive amplicons were purified from agarose gel and cloned into pGEMt Easy (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Sequencing reactions were carried out on three clones of each amplicon with the BigDye terminator kit version 3.1 (AppliedBiosystem, Foster City, CA, USA) and resolved with an ABI 3730 automatic capillary sequencer (AppliedBiosystem, Foster City, CA, USA). Nucleotidic sequences were analysed with the BioEdit Sequence Editor version 7.0 software. Nucleotidic similarity with the NCBI genetic database was assessed using the BLAST tool (available at http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi). Phylogenetic inference was performed with the MEGA version 4 software package (Tamura et al., 2007) . Phylogenetic tree was constructed by neighbor-joining analysis where evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method. The confidence values of the internal nodes were calculated by performing 1000 replicates bootstrap values.  Construction of a recombinant baculovirus for the BoNoV capsid protein  A long fragment product (RdRp region to the poly-A tail) from the genome of a genotype 2 BoNoV strain previously isolated in the laboratory (named B309) was generated by RT-PCR and cloned into pTopoXL (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The insert was sequenced by primer walking. The sequence coding for the ORF2 was isolated and mutations in this sequence were evaluated with the vector NTI 6 software (InforMax, North Bethesda, MD, USA). Specific forward and reverse PCR primers to amplify the ORF2 were selected using the Vector NTI program (InforMax, North Bethesda, MD, USA). These primers include the EcoRI (B309_EcoRI, aaagaattcaatgaagatgact), and HindIII (B309_HindIII, cccaagctttcagaagccatcaagacggggaaggcg) restriction site upstream and downstream of the start and stop codon of the ORF2, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI/ HindIII digested pFastBac Dual plasmid of the bac-to-bac system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A recombinant plasmid was used to transform MAX Efficiency DH10bac competent cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) where transposition between the recombinant pFastBac Dual and a baculovirus shuttle vector (bacmid) occurred. Recombinant bacmid purification was performed from positive clones with the Plasmid Purification Mega kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The transposition was controlled by PCR with M13 primer pair. Monolayers of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells were grown in Sf-900 II medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with a 10% association of penicillin (5000 U/ml)-streptomycin (5 mg/ml) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and subcultured when they reached confluence. Transfection of Sf9 cells was conducted in 6-wells according to the manufacturer protocol to generate a recombinant baculovirus for the BoNoV capsid protein.  Expression and purification of the capsid protein of a bovine norovirus  A recombinant baculovirus stock was generated and monolayers of Sf9 insect cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Five days post-infection, cells and supernatants were harvested and submitted to three freezing/thawing cycles. It was followed by low speed centrifugation to remove cell debris and by high speed centrifugation through 5% sucrose cushion in a Beckman SW28 rotor at 100,000 Â g for 2 h. The pellet was suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged through a 35-65% sucrose gradient at 100,000 Â g for 18 h in a Beckman SW28 rotor. The gradient was fractionated and each fraction was dialysed separately against PBS in 25 kDa porous Spectra/Por membrane (VWR, Leuven, Belgium). Protein concentration in each gradient fraction was evaluated by BCA (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Fractions were then subjected to verification for the presence of either capsid protein as VLP.  Validation of the production of the bovine norovirus-like particles  An aliquot of each fraction was analysed by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-PolyAcrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with the NuPAGE kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to select fractions containing proteins at a molecular weight of about 55-60 kDa. These fractions were analysed under 80 kV EM examination (Philips EM208 transmission electron microscope). Prior to the examination, samples were submitted to ultracentrifugation on grids with increased hydrophilicity by Alcian blue pre-treatment and subjected to negative staining by phosphotungstic acid or uranyl acetate.Serum from a calf experimentally infected with NB2 (Bridger et al., 1984) was used in western blot to detect the B309 BoNoV capsid protein. Briefly, a positive fraction, non-infected Sf9 cells and wild type baculovirus infected Sf9 cells were blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane after electrophoresis under denaturing or non-denaturing conditions. The membrane was blocked overnight at room temperature with PBS complemented with 0.05% tween 20 (PBST 0.05%) and 20% horse serum. The second day, blocking solution was removed and the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 20% horse serum and the 1000-fold diluted calf serum. After three washes with PBST 0.05%, the membrane was incubated for 1 h in PBS containing 20% horse serum and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated, 10,000-fold diluted, anti-bovine immunoglobulins (Ig) G rabbit IgG. After three washes with PBST 0.05%, the chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, Salt Lake city, UT, USA) was added on the membrane and it was revealed in dark room on Kodak BioMax Light film (Sigma-Aldrich, Salt Lake City, UT, USA).  Serum sampling  Blood samples were taken from 439 calves and adult cattle from different premises in Belgium. Serum samples originated from the same area that stool samples but from different premises. The sera were grouped according to the age of the animals. Seven age classes were determined: 1week to 1-month old (n = 20), 1-6 months old (n = 29), 6 months to 1-year old (n = 76), 1-3 years old (n = 105), 3-6 years old (n = 123), 6-9 years old (n = 59) and older than 9 years old (n = 27). In the addition to the 439 sera, a collection of 30 serum samples of colostrum deprived newborn calves from the same region was used as a negative serum control. A commercial bovine anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Bethyl laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA), purified by affinity chromatography, was also used to test the specificity of the ELISA. The serum of the NB2 experimentally infected calf P131 was used as a positive control (Bridger et al., 1984) .  Evaluation of the seroprevalence against BoNoV by ELISA  Positive gradient fractions by both SDS-PAGE analysis and EM examination were selected for the ELISA. Ninetysix well Microlon plates (Greiner Bio-one, Piscataway, NJ, USA) were coated with 100 ml of a VLP solution in PBS (2 ng/ml) and incubated 1 h at 37 8C. They were washed once with PBS and then blocked with PBS complemented with 0.1% tween20 (PBST 0.1%) and with a 4% casein hydrolysate (PBST/HC). Plates were washed once with PBS and then incubated with the 100-fold diluted bovine serum samples in triplicate at 37 8C. After 1 h and three washes with PBST 0.1%, 10,000-fold diluted, HRP conjugated rabbit IgG anti-bovine IgG were applied to each well. After incubation at 37 8C for 1 h, wells were washed three times with PBST 0.1% and 50 ml of the substrate of HRP, tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich, Salt Lake city, UT, USA), were added. The reaction was stopped after 5 min by addition to each well of 50 ml of H 2 SO 4 2 M.Optical densities (OD) at 450 nm were measured with a Thermo Labsystems Multiskan microplate reader and analysed with Ascent Software for Multiskan version 2.6 (Thermo Labsystems, Waltham, MA, USA). All sera were analysed on the same day. The cut-off value for the indirect ELISA test was obtained from the serum samples of the 30 colostrum deprived calves (mean + 1.96 standard deviation) and the apparent prevalence was determined on the 439 bovine serum samples with a 95% confidence interval assuming a binomial exact distribution. All statistical analyses were carried out with the STATA/SE software (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA). The OD means in the different age groups of animals (unequal variance and nonnormal distribution) were compared with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Dagnelie, 1998) . The limit of statistical significance of the conducted test was defined as P 0.05.  Molecular prevalence of bovine norovirus infection  A molecular prevalence of 7.5% (CI 95%: [3.7; 13.4%]) for BoNoV infection was found in the stool samples of diarrhoeic calves. Twelve potentially positive amplicons were generated by use of the different primer pairs: 9 with the CBECu pair, 1 with both the CBECu and the BEC pairs, 1 with both the CBECu and the JV12/13 pairs and 1 only with the BEC pair. No amplicon was generated with the p289/ 290 pair. By BLAST and phylogenetic analysis, 10 amplified polymerase sequences were genetically related to NoV genogroup III genotype 2 strains (Fig. 1) . The two other ones, amplified with the CBECu pair at a lower molecular size than expected (about 418 bp), matched with about 90% identity with bovine rotavirus polymerase (VP1) gene sequence. These two samples were also confirmed rotavirus-positive by ELISA based on the rotavirus VP6 detection.BoNoV were found equally in diagnostic and necropsy samples. Another etiology (rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium parvum or Escherichia coli) was found in all the 10 BoNoV positive samples by different tests performed in a diagnostic laboratory. Remarkably, the sample BV119 was positive by ELISA for bovine rotavirus but no rotavirus nucleotidic sequence was amplified with the CBECu pair in this sample.  Virus-like particles of the bovine norovirus isolate B309  The B309 BoNoV isolate was previously related to the genotype 2 BoNoV in its RdRp region. By BLAST after the sequencing of its C-terminal part, the B309 isolate shared 89% of nucleotide and 98% of amino acid identity with the NB2 in the entire capsid gene. The B309_EcoRI/B309_Hin-dIII amplified ORF2 sequence was compared to the original sequence and two mutations were found. The first mutation was a transition in the 5th codon and modified the composition in amino acid (Asp 5 ! Asn 5 ). The second mutation was located in the 97th codon and was a silent mutation. A recombinant bacmid for the B309 ORF2 was generated and 72 h after recombinant baculovirus infection, proteins of about 57 kDa could be detected by SDS-PAGE analysis in several fractions obtained by the gradient applied on harvested cells and supernatants (Fig. 2) . Bioinformatic analysis with the Vector NTI software predicted a similar molecular weight for the B309 capsid protein. Particles from 30 to 40 nm range diameter with typical calicivirus cup-shaped depressions were observed under EM examination of some positive fractions of the gradient (Fig. 3) .  Western blot analysis  By western blot analysis, fractions containing B309 VLP reacted at about 57 kDa with a serum resulting from the immunization of a calf with NB2 strain. A weak positive band was also obtained in the lane containing Sf9 cells infected by a wild type baculovirus (Fig. 4A) . Western blot performed under non-denaturing conditions revealed a band at about 120 kDa with VLP but not against mock infected or Sf9 cell components recovered after wild type baculovirus infection (Fig. 4B) .  Seroprevalence against BoNoV genotype 2 in the Belgian cattle  Only fractions positive to EM examination (visualization of VLP) were used in the ELISA format. Analysis of sera from colostrum deprived newborn calves allowed the definition of a cut-off value of 0.3 for the ELISA. Optical density values obtained for the bovine anti-rabbit IgG serum (mean: 0.1) were similar to those of colostrum deprived newborn calves. By statistical analysis, a high seroprevalence of 93.2% (CI 95%: [90.4; 95.3%]) was found in Belgian cattle sera. Significant statistical differences were found between the mean OD value of different age groups of animals: between the colostrum deprived calves and the 1-week to 1-month-old calf groups, the 1-6 months old and 6 months to 1-year-old groups, and the 6 months to 1-year-old group and the 1-3 years old group. In the boxplot graph, median value of the ''1 week to 1 month old'' class rose dramatically compared to the median value of the newborn class. This value was maintained during the ''1 month to 6 months old'' period and was followed by a new rise in the ''6 months to 1 year old'' age class. A drop in the values of medians was shown between this last class and the ''1 to 3 year old'' class. Medians were maintained thereafter in the adult period (Fig. 5) . Remarkably, during this period, some OD values were below the cut-off (dots below the line at 0.3 OD value in Fig. 5 ) and were similar to the values recorded during the colostral period.  Discussion  Although HuNoV are known to be widely distributed and already recognized as a threat to public health, the impact of BoNoV is still poorly studied. In Europe, very few countries have performed epidemiological studies. The 1year prospective study reported in the present paper endorsed that genotype 2 BoNoV are endemic in European cattle. A BoNoV prevalence of 7.5% was found in stool samples of diarrhoeic calves. In the serological approach, a strong seroprevalence (93.2%) against genotype 2 BoNoV was determined with a VLP-based antibody ELISA in cattle of the same region. Together, the results of prevalence and seroprevalence allowed the description of the evolution of the antibody levels against genotype 2 BoNoV infection during the life of the cattle.The molecular prevalence of BoNoV in samples coming from the Belgian diagnostic laboratory was in accordance with studies in Great Britain (Milnes et al., 2007) and Korea where Park et al. (2007) report also a majority of genotype 2 infection. The genotype of the strains detected in the British study was not clarified. The prevalence determined by RT-PCR analysis in this study is also similar to the results obtained by an antigen capture ELISA in Germany and developed using a genotype 1 JV strain (Deng et al., 2003) . As genotypes 1 and 2 BoNoV are antigenically Fig. 2 . Supernatants of the baculovirus expression of the capsid protein of the B309 isolate were submitted to purification in sucrose gradient. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed on each fraction and the membrane was stained with Coomassie blue. Results for some fractions are reported here (lanes 1-9) . Proteins of about 57 kDa, the expected molecular weight for the B309 capsid protein, were shown. Supernatant of Sf9 cells infected by a wild type baculovirus (lane WT) was used as negative control. MwM: molecular weight marker. Fig. 3 . Electron micrographs of virus-like particles (VLP) of the bovine norovirus B309 isolate. The VLP were produced by expressing the capsid protein in the baculovirus protein expression system and purified in a sucrose gradient. The photograph was taken from the fourth fraction. After uranyl acetate negative staining on Alcyan blue treated greads, particles with the specific size (approximately 40 nm) and morphology of calicivirus-like virions were readily observed. The nucleocapsids were isometric, showed icosahedral symmetry and the border has cup-shaped depressions. Bar, 50 nm. distinct (Oliver et al., 2006) , the true BoNoV prevalence could be higher or a preferential geographic distribution could exist. In contrast, Mattison et al. (2007) detected only 1.6% positive in stool samples from a random study in Canadian cattle but Smiley et al. (2003) detected up to 72% of samples positive in two farms in USA. In a longitudinal study in The Netherlands, prevalences of 31.6 and 4.2% were found in farm stool samples and individual samples of dairy cattle, respectively (Van Der Poel et al., 2003) . Thus, prevalence results by RT-PCR seem to depend on the continent, the country, the sampling strategy and especially on the test conditions (e.g. annealing temperature, primers, use of internal control as mentioned in Scipioni et al., 2008a) . Also the type of study, cross-sectional versus longitudinal as a part of the Dutch study, could explain some differences. BoNoV infection seems to be strongly related to the age with a higher rate in the first year of the animal life. Positive results were obtained along all the sampling period (data not shown) but further research is needed to investigate a potential seasonality for the infection unlike as described for HuNoV (Mounts et al., 2000) . In our results, we detected more isolates with the CBECu pair than with all the other pairs. Also, the CBECu primers allowed the detection of two bovine rotavirus 5 . Seroprevalence against bovine noroviruses in the Belgian cattle. The OD means of the different age groups of animals, collected in the ELISA format (unequal variance and non-normal distribution), were compared with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The distribution of the optical densities obtained with the indirect ELISA is represented in a box plot format where optical densities are reported in function of age classes. An asterisk highlights significant statistical differences between means of the different age groups. The cut-off is represented by the line at 0.3 and the dots represent extreme values. OD: optical density, negative control: optical density value obtained for the bovine negative serum (anti-rabbit IgG), positive control: optical density value obtained for the positive control (calf experimentally infected with the Newbury2 strain, Bridger et al., 1984) , mo: month, wk: week, yr: year. infections with however a small difference in the molecular weight for the amplicon (418 bp versus 532 bp). To our knowledge, such observation has never been reported and it could account for some differences between RT-PCR prevalence results depending on the primers used. Nucleotide similarities were found between the CBECu primers and the prototype bovine rotavirus sequence to which they matched by BLAST. On the 23 nt of the CBECu-F sequence, 14 nt including the last five nt matched exactly with the sequence of the bovine rotavirus polymerase (VP1, genbank accession number: J04346). Nucleotide similarity for CBECu-R was smaller. The CBECu-F primer was designed to match the widely conserved YGDD motif in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of RNA viruses (Bruenn, 1991) and this could explain the detection of bovine rotavirus. Some strains were detected with primers designed to detect HuNoV (JV pair) but at a low rate, as previously reported (Van Der Poel et al., 2003) . No HuNoV sequences were identified despite the use of two primer sets designed for their detection, suggesting at least a very low prevalence of these human viruses in cattle. Despite the variety of the primers used in the present study, the lack of detection of the genotype 1 BoNoV could be explained by suboptimal primer use for the RT-PCR (Oliver et al., 2007b) . The age of the cattle population studied was also suggested as an explanation for the lower detection of genogroup III genotype 1 NoV (Oliver et al., 2007b) . As RT-PCR primers used in this study only target the viral polymerase region and thus miss potential recombinant strains, the possibility that some positive samples contained chimaeric bovine noroviruses could be another explanation for the low apparent prevalence of GIII.1 noroviruses.Interestingly, few amino acid mutations were detected between the native B309 strain sequence (year of isolation: 2003) and the NB2 strain sequence (year of isolation: 1976) (Scipioni et al., submitted for publication) . Nearly all mutations were located in the P domain with surprisingly relatively few mutations in the P2 sub-domain, the most variable region of VP1 known to support antigenic determinants and drift-induced antigenic variation in NoV strains (Allen et al., 2008; Lochridge and Hardy, 2007) .The two mutations detected in the VLP constructed in the baculovirus system compared to the native B309 strain, did not affect the antigenicity by their effect and their localisation in the amino acid sequence. Oliver et al. (2007a) reported that the P131 calf serum did not react in western blotting with BoNoV genotype 2 VLP in denaturing reaction but react at a higher molecular weight than expected under non-denaturing conditions. In our conditions this serum reacts against a fraction containing VLP but also with infected Sf9 cells, in denaturing conditions. To test the specificity of this reaction against infected Sf9 cells, western blots were carried out with foetal calf serum and serum from a colostrum deprived newborn calf used in this study. With these two sera, a positive band at the same molecular weight was observed with baculovirus infected Sf9 cells under denaturing conditions whereas no reaction was detected in non-denaturing conditions (Mauroy and Thiry, unpublished results). These data confirm the nonspecific binding of bovine immunoglobulins on denatured protein extracts from baculovirus infected Sf9 cells. In nondenaturing conditions, the serum only reacts against VLP. Thus, B309 VLP are representative of the genotype 2 BoNoV.A high seroprevalence (93.2%) against genotype 2 BoNoV was found by ELISA. Genotypes 1 and 2 in the BoNoV genogroup, although antigenically distinct, were shown to cross-react in ELISA to the heterologous VLP but at low serum dilution (log 10 1.7) (Oliver et al., 2006) . However the true genotype 2 seroprevalence should still remain high, even corrected for a lower sensitivity and specificity of the test. The OD values obtained with the serum raised against rabbit IgG in bovine confirmed the selected cut-off. Almost all colostrum deprived calves did not have antibodies against BoNoV as previously described (Deng et al., 2003) . It suggests that BoNoV infection is mainly localised in the intestine, according to the observations with HuNoV (Mattner et al., 2006) , and that vertical transmission of the virus is rare. The rise in antibody levels in 1 or 2 weeks old calves suggests an acquisition of antibodies through colostrum absorption or from early infection. Information on prevalence brought by the RT-PCR analysis suggests that the risk of infection during the first 6 months of life is high. The antibody levels determined by ELISA rise again in the post-colostral period (6 months to 1-year old). These results could be explained by a large exposure during this period and the development of natural immunity.The finding that cattle aged 3-9 years still had antibodies suggests either a long lasting immunity against BoNoV or frequent re-infections. Several characteristics of NoV (environmental resistance, fecal-oral transmission) and farming practices in developed countries could increase the risk of re-infection in cattle, whereas such re-infection was not observed during a prospective RT-PCR study in The Netherlands (Van Der Poel et al., 2003) and during a cross-sectional RT-PCR study performed by ourselves on stool from up to 6 months old cattle (n = 47) housed in two different premises (Mauroy and Thiry, unpublished results). However in a retrospective study in Great Britain, Milnes et al. (2007) have amplified norovirus sequences by RT-PCR in adult stool samples. The detection of high levels of antibodies in the adult also suggests their presence in the colostrum. It could explain the antibody rise in neonates after colostrum intake. Remarkably, in contrast to the 1-week to 1-year-old group, some OD values of adult cattle were below the cut-off of the test. These data suggest that antibody levels decrease in some adult cattle reinforcing the hypothesis of a short lived immunity.The zoonotic risk associated with animal NoV is widely discussed but is hypothetical. However, several recent data showed that HuNoV replication occurred experimentally in gnotobiotic animals including calves (Souza et al., 2008) . Furthermore, Mattison et al. (2007) have identified HuNoV sequences in swine and cattle. Shellfish like oysters are known as a main route of food-associated HuNoV outbreaks. As they bind specifically HuNoV to their digestive tissues (Le and as BoNoV sequences were also detected in these molluscs (Costantini et al., 2006) , new recombinant strains could appear through mixed infection. Such event was already reported with human strains (Symes et al., 2007) . Mixed infections could occur in countries with high population densities of human and production animals and with high prevalence of BoNoV in premises. However, this study did not detect any contaminations of cattle with HuNoV.Experimental infection of calves with BoNoV has shown their low pathogenicity (Bridger et al., 1984) but their impact in association with classic enteric pathogens in superinfections and in economic losses (weight gain, health status, veterinary treatment cost) has not been studied. In this study, BoNoV were found both in diagnostic samples and necropsy samples and always in association with other pathogens. The role of BoNoV as pathogens in the bovine species should be considered, taking into account their endemicity in the investigated situation and their presence in diarrhoeic calves.More specific primers, primers targeting both the ORF1end and the ORF2 regions, a broader sampling strategy, in particular regarding the age of the animals, and an ELISA including VLP of the genotype 1 could refine epidemiological data for BoNoV infection. An Ig discriminative ELISA format (IgA, IgM, IgG1 and 2) could define the status of the animals during their first year of life.Together, the results of prevalence and seroprevalence show the endemicity of the genotype 2 BoNoV in the studied region. The first 1-year period of life is critical for BoNoV infection. During this period, the immunological status of cattle against BoNoV varies both by colostrum intake and by natural infection.  					1			
23578938	Virus discovery: one step beyond	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102788/	Recent advances in the metagenomics field have had huge effects on the identification and characterization of newly emerging viral pathogens. To allow timely and efficient responses to future viral threats, an integrated multidisciplinary approach utilizing expertises in several areas, including clinical assessment, virus surveillance, virus discovery, pathogenesis, and the molecular basis of the host response to infection, is required. It requires the scientific community involved in virus discovery to go one step beyond.	Introduction  After an initial decrease in industrialized countries in the first half of the last century, the burden of infectious diseases on human health worldwide has markedly increased in the past decades [1] . A complex mix of predisposing factors in our modern world has created new opportunities for the emergence of infectious diseases in animals and humans alike. This is largely related to globalization, environmental and anthropogenic changes, and the changing nature of contacts between animals and humans [1,2 ,3 ,4] . Most of these emerging events in humans are caused by viruses that have their origin in the animal world [2 ,5-8,9 ,10,11] . Following initial zoonotic transmissions these viruses usually go through a period of adaptation to the new human host, after which they may spread to cause epidemics or eventually a true pandemic. The most devastating examples of pandemics caused by initially zoonotic viruses are the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that spilled over from chimpanzee reservoirs and Spanish influenza that spilled over from bird reservoirs [12] [13] [14] . Other examples are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus from bats and civet cats, swine influenza A virus H1N1 2009, and Nipah virus from bats and pigs [15] [16] [17] 18 ] . The human mortality figures associated with these emerging viral diseases ranged from hundreds in limited epidemics to many millions in pandemics. For example, the ongoing AIDS pandemic caused the deaths of tens of millions of people, whereas SARS that had apparently spilled over from a bat reservoir, and caused a starting pandemic could for the first time in history be halted before more than one thousand people had died [19] . A major impact of newly emerging and re-emerging virus infections is also seen on animals. In wildlife it poses a direct threat to biodiversity, and in domestic animals it causes huge losses to livestock production. The latter may be due to direct mortality or to culling strategies for disease control [2 ] .In this light it is important to create a well coordinated global effort to monitor viral pathogens to gain a thorough understanding of the diversity of viruses in animals and humans, virus transmission routes, and virus tropism providing information about potential pathogenic threats from animal reservoirs to human health [2 ,18 ,20] . Thus, an integrated multidisciplinary approach utilizing expertises in several areas, including clinical assessment, virus surveillance, virus discovery, virus diversity, evolutionary processes, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and the molecular basis of the host response to infection, will be required to understand the dynamics of infection and to mitigate potential effects of future infectious threats ( Figure 1 ).  Clinical assessment and surveillance  One of the most overlooked but crucial aspects in identifying new infectious disease threats is the role that clinicians, veterinarians and epidemiologists play in the recognition of idiopathic cases of newly emerging virus infections. These professionals are the first to recognize relatively uncommon or completely new infectious diseases, on the basis of changing clinical and epidemiological trends. They should participate in wellcoordinated collaborative networks that may function as our first line of defence against newly emerging viruses. These networks should be involved in syndrome surveillance in combination with routine surveillance activities for known pathogens in both animals and humans to identify at a very early stage, emerging viral infections that would otherwise fly under the radar [16] This is essential for a timely response that ideally could even abrogate the viral threat altogether. butchers, farmers, veterinarians, and zoo workers, or populations with increased susceptibility, such as injecting drug users and immunocompromised individuals. In addition, syndrome and virus surveillance should focus on domestic animals as well as wildlife with key reservoir species that have previously shown to represent an imminent health threat to humans like domestic poultry, pigs and ruminants, as well as wild birds rodents and bats, respectively. Such efforts will lead to the identification of future viral threats and allow early detection of emergence in humans and control of their eventual spread [2 ,3 ,18 ,20] . In combination with knowledge about the molecular basis of pathogenicity and transmissibility in the respective species, this information may even allow prediction of the viruses that are most likely to cross the species barrier and what is required for the evolutionary transition of an animal virus into a human pathogen.  Virus discovery -state of the art techniques  Despite the use of a wide range of sensitive diagnostic assays, in a relatively large proportion of patients and animals suffering from apparently infectious disease, no pathogens can be detected, suggesting the presence of unidentified viruses in human and animal populations. In the pre-genomics era, new viruses were first identified by animal experiments, virus isolation in tissue culture or standard molecular detection methods. Nowadays, in order to discover and isolate new or (re-)emerging viruses, it is crucial to develop and implement a set of novel molecular techniques, which, when applied as a technology platform, increase the success rate of finding new viruses in humans and animals that may or may not be associated with new or already identified disease entities.Besides classical continuous cell cultures, in which many of the recently discovered viruses fail to replicate, several new ex vivo culture systems are being developed. Natural viral replication circumstances may be best mimicked by infection of organ cultures of surgery-derived by-product tissues. An example of the success of this approach is human rhinovirus C (HRVC), recently implicated in upper and lower respiratory tract infections of children and individuals with chronic respiratory diseases. Although HRVC was discovered in 2006 [21] , efforts to propagate the virus culture failed until Bochkov and coworkers [22] employed human organ culture of sinus mucosa to serially propagate human rhinovirus C, which ultimately allowed complete full-length genome sequencing and cloning [22] . Likewise, ex vivo swine respiratory e2 Emerging viruses Viral genomics aims at identification and characterization of emerging and re-emerging viruses. It requires different disciplines in an integrated response to allow viruses to be discovered and their potential pathogenic threat to be effectively countered.and enteric tract cultures have been used to study influenza virus infections in their natural target cells [23] [24] [25] .With the development of PCR and novel sequencing techniques, we have seen an enormous increase in the identification and characterization of viral genomes. This has lead to development of new species-specific assays for routine diagnostic surveillance in animals and humans. In addition, generic PCR assays, that is PCR assays specific for a broader taxonomic range than one virus species (e.g. a whole virus genus or family) were developed which allow the identification of new virus species within already known virus families [26] [27] [28] [29] . A method for comprehensive and unbiased analysis of viral prevalence in biological specimens was devised using long oligonucleotide (70-mer) DNA microarrays with the potential to simultaneously detect hundreds of viruses [30] . The 'pan-viral microarray' not only allows detection of known viruses, but also discovery of new viruses if they are sufficiently related to those already known to permit specific hybridization [31] [32] [33] [34] .Breakthroughs in the field of metagenomics have had farreaching effects on the identification and characterization of newly emerging viral pathogens and on the recognition that a growing number of diseases that were once attributed to unknown causes are actually caused or triggered by infectious agents [1, 35] . Viral metagenomics assays rely on sequence-independent amplification of nucleic acids from clinical samples, in combination with nextgeneration sequencing platforms and bioinformatics tools for sequence analysis [3 ,10,18 ,35-37] . They are relatively simple and fast, and allow detection of new viruses even if they are highly divergent from those that are already known [3 ] . Since, the first application of metagenomics to the field of virology [38] , it has been increasingly applied for virus discovery purposes resulting in an >100-fold increase in related publications in this field in 2010 and a substantial increase in the identification of new viruses [3 ,39,40 ] . With the development of these new techniques, the identification of a new virus and its complete genomic characterization can be done in a matter of days and at a fraction of the costs compared to only a few years ago [41, 42 ] .It is unlikely, however, that genomics-based tools will be used in a clinical diagnostic setting within the next decade. Methods need to be cost-effective and in a high-throughput format, which requires investment in bioinformatics tools, databases, and data management. Molecular diagnosticians need to gain experience in, and have the ability to interpret the data generated by these radically different genomics-based techniques and hurdles regarding patient privacy issues may need to be resolved before transition of genomics-based tools from a research setting to the clinic.One step beyond . . .After virus discovery and initial genomic characterization of the viral genome, an integrative approach to determine epidemiology and pathogenicity of the virus and the disease it causes is required in order to develop and tailor effective intervention and containment strategies. Many factors, among which immune status, age, and nutritional status, play an important role in the clinical outcome of infection. This underlines the importance of studying both host and pathogen parameters in an integrated way in the combat against virus infections. Comparisons between closely related viruses in different but related host species provides crucial information into various host pathways involved in different outcomes of disease. This is perhaps best exemplified by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections in different primate host species. Generally, non-human primate species that are naturally infected by SIV do not develop AIDS whereas non-natural hosts, like, for example humans when infected with HIV, do develop immunodeficiency and AIDS. Genomicsbased approaches to delineate host responses to infection in both natural and non-natural hosts revealed that nonnatural hosts have a higher viral load, immune activation, loss of certain T-cell subsets, and higher production of interferon-a in response to SIV infection than natural hosts [43] [44] [45] . Thus, the study of key interactions between host and pathogen may unravel possibilities for development of (multi-targeted) therapies designed to limit virus replication and to mitigate (immune)pathology and transmissibility.A few examples of recent important zoonotic events and the role of an integrative approach to elucidate their pathogenesis in order to combat such viral infections will be discussed below.Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus may cause infection of the lower respiratory tract and severe pneumonia in humans [46] . In contrast, human influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 viruses are important causes of upper respiratory disease, but rarely cause pneumonia [47] . Viral attachment to the host cell is a critical determinant for infection and tropism of the virus and studies into receptor attachment of human influenza A viruses and avian H5N1 influenza A virus revealed that the pattern of attachment in the respiratory tract coincides well with the difference in disease outcome. H5N1 influenza A virus primarily attaches to type II pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages, and nonciliated cuboidal epithelial cells in terminal bronchioles [48] , whereas seasonal human influenza A viruses attaches primarily to tracheal and bronchial epithelium and type I pneumocytes in the alveoli [49] . Essentially, human seasonal influenza viruses mainly bind to the upper respiratory tract whereas H5N1 avian influenza viruses have a predilection for the lower respiratory tract [50] .The pattern of receptor attachment also correlates with marked differences in the efficiency of human-to-human transmission of influenza A viruses, with H5N1 influenza A viruses displaying a notoriously low level of human-tohuman transmission. There are concerns that the H5N1 virus could acquire molecular characteristics that would allow it to become more readily transmissible between humans and initiate a pandemic. The binding preference of the HA surface glycoprotein of H5N1 influenza A virus can be changed from avian a-2,3-linked sialic acid receptors to the human a-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors resulting in the associated change in tropism for the upper respiratory tract [51] . To study the conditions that would indeed allow H5N1 influenza A virus to acquire the ability of aerosol transmission in vivo, H5N1 influenza A virus was genetically modified to study whether the virus could be transmitted through air. Five amino acid substitutions proved to be consistently present in airborne-transmitted H5N1 influenza A viruses in ferrets [52] [53] [54] . The collective data suggest that highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses have the potential to evolve directly in ways that allow airborne transmission between mammals, without reassortment in any intermediate host, illustrating the risk that these viruses may eventually become pandemic in humans. The next step is to perform a risk assessment of the likelihood of such a virus to arise and spread using computer simulations and associated laboratory experiments. This will ultimately allow informed decision making to justify efforts for pandemic preparedness for highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza A virus.Recently, a previously unknown coronavirus HCoV-EMC was isolated from a patient presenting with acute pneumonia and renal failure with fatal outcome in Saudi Arabia [55] . The clinical presentation of the patient was remarkably similar to that caused by the SARS coronavirus in SARS patients during the outbreak in 2002/2003 [55, 56] , whereas most infections caused by other human coronaviruses are relatively mild. The functional receptor for SARS coronavirus in humans is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [57] , but it was soon established that HCoV-EMC uses a different receptor [58] . Fourteen human HCoV-EMC cases have been identified to date, resulting in eight fatalities from respiratory disease. The transmission chain of HCoV-EMC remains unclear and could be explained by human-to-human transmission as well as repeated introductions from a reservoir animal host. The complete genome of the virus was characterized soon after the discovery of the virus [41] . On the basis of the genetic relatedness between HCoV-EMC and bat coronaviruses, it is most likely that this virus emerged from bats. Such host species switching is plausible in light of the recent identification of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), an evolutionary well-conserved protein, as the functional receptor of HCoV-EMC and the ability of HCoV-EMC to use bat DPP4 as a functional receptor [59] . The identification of the receptor will contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of HCoV-EMC and may facilitate development of antiviral strategies.Interestingly, SARS coronavirus is also thought to originate from bats, by recombination between two bat viruses. The resulting bat virus supposedly was transmitted first to palm civets (Paguma larvata) or other carnivores, and subsequently to humans at live animal markets in southern China [17] . Studies into the pathogenesis of the SARS coronavirus revealed that cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) show lung pathology similar in nature to that observed in human adults with SARS upon infection [60, 61] . Using a combined approach of animal experiments with immunohistochemistry and functional genomics, it was shown that the induction of early interferon signaling may be critical in conferring protection against SARS coronavirus [61] . This notion was enforced by showing that aged SARS coronavirusinfected macaques show more severe pathology under similar viral replication levels, which is associated with an increase in differential gene expression, inflammation, and reduced type I interferon expression compared to young adult macaques [62] . Interestingly also in humans a clear age-related susceptibility to developing clinical symptoms and severe disease has been noted. Subsequent therapeutic treatment of aged macaques with type I interferon reduces pathology in aged SARS coronavirus infected macaques without affecting virus replication levels [62] , suggesting that not only prophylactic, but also therapeutic treatment with pegylated interferona should be considered as antiviral treatment [63] . Of note, however, is that subsequent studies showed that different non-human primate species develop pathology upon SARS coronavirus infection through distinct acute lung injury pathways [64] . This should be taken into account when analyzing outcomes of intervention strategies.  Conclusions  The increased threat of emerging and re-emerging virus infections to human and animal health asks for a timely and effective response to counteract these viral infections. This has been recognized and has resulted in the formation of quite a number of initiatives focusing on improved surveillance, virus discovery, and effective response management. For example, the European funded Seventh Framework Project (FP7) entitled European Management Platform for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious disease Entities (EMPERIE) contributes to effectively countering the potential public health threat caused by new and emerging infectious diseases in Europe by establishing a powerful network capable of structural and systematic prediction, identification, modeling and surveillance of infectious diseases, health threats and pathogens. A nationally funded initiative in The Netherlands -the VIRGO consortium -focuses on providing the infrastructure for virus discovery and for progressing our knowledge of viruses and the mechanisms of mutual virus-host interactions which will feed into the subsequent development of novel interventions, diagnostics and prognostics at the levels of both individual patients and populations. The FP7 European funded PATHSEEK consortium will set up a disruptive diagnostic technological pathogen sequencing platform that will deliver in 24-48 hours, all possible drug resistance mutations as well as data on nosocomial infection, from one patient sample in one single assay. Another FP7 European funded consortium called ANTIGONE (ANTIcipating the Global Onset of Novel Epidemics). These and comparable or related consortia which become increasingly interlinked, provide international collaborations with different expertise areas to allow broad range responses to mitigate potential effects of future infectious threats ( Figure 1) with quite some success stories already.  				1	1			
16542729	Corticosteroid treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112522/	Summary Background The patterns of corticosteroids usage in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and associated treatment outcomes in Hong Kong were studied. Method Patients≥18years old who either had not received corticosteroid or had taken corticosteroids within 14days from symptom onset were included. Patients receiving corticosteroids beyond 15days or other investigational treatment within 21days from symptom onset were excluded. Of 1313 eligible patients, 1287 with major corticosteroid dosage-type combinations were analysed. Results Crude death rate was lower among 1188 steroid-treated patients compared to 99 patients in Group No Steroid (17.0% vs. 28.3%). Among four corticosteroid groups studied, mortality was lowest in the low-dose oral prednisolone (Group P) and high-dose methylprednisolone (Group MP) groups. On multivariate analysis of the corticosteroid groups, independent factors related to death were: corticosteroid group, older age, co-morbidity, worse chest X-ray score, worse respiratory status at Days 8–10 and higher admission white cell count. Again Groups P and MP had significantly lower adjusted odds ratios for death and lower bacterial and fungal culture rates. Despite worse chest X-ray scores and higher cumulative corticosteroid dosages in Group MP compared to Group P, fewer patients required rescue pulsed corticosteroid. Patients on hydrocortisone (Group HC) had the highest positive culture rates. Conclusion We speculate that corticosteroid with higher in-vitro inflammatory potency administered at timing and dosages commensurate with disease severity may be conducive to better outcome from SARS as a consequence of more effective control of immunopathological lung damage.	Introduction  The role of corticosteroids in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is controversial. In Hong Kong, corticosteroids were widely used because of its reported efficacy in mainland China, 1 and because four of five initial SARS patients died with best supportive treatment alone without corticosteroid. Survival rates in Hong Kong had improved with combined corticosteroids and ribavirin treatment in subsequent patients. 2e5 Methylprednisolone in ''pulsed'' dosages (at !500 mg per dose) was also frequently added to the baseline corticosteroid regimen on further deterioration or recrudescence of symptoms and signs. 1e6 SARS has been proposed to be a triphasic disease, commencing with viral replication, followed by immunopathological damage and finally pulmonary destruction. 6 Advocates of corticosteroids aimed at controlling the immunopathological phase of SARS 5, 7 and suppressing elevated cytokines levels. 8 Opponents contended that a selflimiting course had been observed in SARS even with significant initial chest radiograph involvement, 9, 10 and that corticosteroids only increased susceptibility to secondary infections. 11, 12 The Hong Kong Hospital Authority SARS Collaborative Group (HASCOG) tracked information of all probable and confirmed Hong Kong SARS patients as defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria. 13 In the following study, we aimed to study the patterns of corticosteroids usage and the associated treatment outcomes.  Study design and subjects  Clinical information of all SARS patients was retrospectively collected from May to October 2003, with enhancement by the HA Clinical Management System (CMS) which provided on-line laboratory and medication information. The following patients were included: (i) !18 years of age and still hospitalised for SARS after 22 March 2003, when discovery of the novel coronavirus (CoV) was announced in Hong Kong; and either (ii) had not been given corticosteroids throughout the course of hospitalisation; or (iii) had received corticosteroid within 0e14 days of symptom onset. All included patients had to fulfil the latest case definition for SARS. 13 Patients were excluded if they: (i) had been discharged or had died before 22 March 2003, when lack of knowledge had resulted in variations in management; (ii) had corticosteroids started beyond 15 days after symptom onset; or (iii) had received other investigational treatment within 0 to 21 days of symptom onset, including lopinavir/ritonavir combination, immunoglobulin, convalescent plasma, anti-tumour necrosis factor-a and traditional Chinese medicine.  Data collection  Demographic data, serial laboratory test results, intensive care unit admission, requirement for pulsed methylprednisolone rescue and assisted ventilation, microbiological findings including bacterial, viral and fungal cultures, antibiotics usage and final outcomes were recorded. Presence of comorbidities were defined by illnesses with possible adverse impacts on patient outcome, namely, (i) diabetes with documented end-organ complications (vascular, cardiac, neurological, renal); (ii) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (excluding chronic asthma); and (iii) other chronic diseases requiring long-term treatment (cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, renal, liver). Because of laboratory variations in reference ranges of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), an LDH ratio, obtained by dividing measured values by the respective upper limits of normal range, was used for comparison.  Microbiology  Positive cultures of microorganisms including bacteria and fungi were documented. Positive laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV infection was defined as two or more positive real-time reverse transcriptaseepolymerase chain reaction (RTePCR) for SARS-CoV in nasopharyngeal aspirate, nasopharyngeal swab or stool, or positive RTePCR of one specimen confirmed by two laboratories, or four-fold rise in IgG against SARS-CoV in paired acute-convalescent sera or four-fold of threshold IgG in single sera. The WHO criteria in identifying laboratory-confirmed cases were adopted. 13   Corticosteroid regimens  To study the effect of initial dosages on the subsequent disease course, predominant types of corticosteroid employed were defined as those that contributed to at least two-thirds of the total dosage during the first four days of treatment, excluding dosages due to pulsed MP rescue. Subsequent analysis was based on the following corticosteroid types: intravenous hydrocortisone (Group HC), intravenous methylprednisolone (Group MP), oral prednisolone (Group P), or intravenous pulsed corticosteroid (Group Pulse). ''Pulsed corticosteroid'' is defined as intravenous methylprednisolone administered at 500 mg or more per dose for at least 1 day from the day of corticosteroid commencement. ''Rescue pulse'' is defined as intravenous methylprednisolone administered at 500 mg or more per dose for at least 1 day started after at least 1 day of corticosteroid treatment. Patients who had not received any corticosteroids were designated 'Group No Steroid', within which patients who had and had not received ribavirin were identified. Patients with no major types of corticosteroids were excluded from all analyses, and were defined as receiving more than one type of corticosteroid (excluding pulsed methylprednisolone), with total dosage of any type not reaching at least two-thirds of the total corticosteroid dosage in the first 4 days after steroid commencement. To reflect antiinflammatory effects, all steroid types were converted to hydrocortisone-equivalent based on relative glucocorticoid activities in the following ratios: 4 mg methylprednisolone ¼ 5 mg prednisolone ¼ 20 mg hydrocortisone.  Scoring of chest radiographs  Chest radiographs were scored using a ''0e4'' scoring system to indicate the geographical extent of radiographical opacities: score 0 ¼ 0%, 1 ¼ 1e 25%, 2 ¼ 26e50%, 3 ¼ 51e75%, 4 ¼ 76e100%. Total score ranged from 0 to 24 for all six lung zones (lower/middle/upper in both left and right lungs), with higher scores denoting more extensive chest X-ray (CXR) involvement. The scoring method was standardised and performed by radiologists from individual hospitals.  Respiratory status  The PaO 2 /FiO 2 (P/F) ratio, defined in this study as the worst arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) divided by the fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO 2 ) on any particular day was used as a reflection of the patients' respiratory status. Where PaO 2 values were not available, they were estimated from oxygen saturation values obtained by pulse oximetry (SpO 2 ) using the oxygen dissociation curve, with the help of an equation which relates SpO 2 to PaO 2 at standard temperature (37 C). 14 Respiratory status was categorised according to the worst P/F ratio on any day: 0e 26.5 kPa (0e199 mmHg) being ''acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)'' and 26.6e39.9 kPa (200e299 mmHg) being ''acute lung injury (ALI)''. 15 Higher values were arbitrarily divided into ''mild respiratory impairment'' (RI, 40.0e 53.2 kPa or 300e399 mmHg) and normal (53.3e 62.0 kPa or 400e465 mmHg). Since SARS-related acute respiratory failure (ARF) usually peaks by Day 8 after symptom onset, 6 patient outcome was studied according to their respiratory status on Days 8e10 from symptom onset. 16, 17 Outcomes The primary outcome studied was the survival benefits of different treatment groups. To study the potentially life-threatening infectious complications of corticosteroid with possible impact on outcome, results of bacterial and fungal cultures together with treatment for fungal infection and tuberculosis were recorded as secondary outcomes. Since ribavirin was used in 1219 SARS patients in this study (93.9%), the final analysis was performed only on patients who had ever received ribavirin in order to remove confounding effect of ribavirin, if any.  Ethics  Ethical committee approval was considered not necessary because direct patient intervention was not involved and individual patient data were not presented.  Statistical analysis  Data are presented in mean AE SD or median (interquartile range [IQR]). Two-sided KruskaleWallis test or chi-squared test was used for univariate comparisons of demographic and clinical parameters among the groups where appropriate. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed by backward selection of variables showing a P value of <0.20 in the univariate analysis by Wilcoxon test (with normal approximation) or chi-squared test to predict the effect of various corticosteroid groups on survival after adjusting for possible confounding factors. The selected model gave the adjusted ratios of odds of death and their 95% confidence intervals for individual corticosteroid groups relative to a chosen reference group after controlling for all identified confounding factors. Using demographic variables and clinical parameters on admission for model entry, the first multivariate model studied the survival outcome of various corticosteroid groups over the Group No Steroid. Further analyses were performed using clinical parameters at steroid commencement rather than on admission to compare among the steroid groups their survival rates. In these further models, the corticosteroid group showing the highest survival benefit over the Group No Steroid in the first multivariate model was selected as the reference group. In all analyses a P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were done using SAS version 8.02.  Results  During the 2003 outbreak in Hong Kong, a total of 1755 probable SARS patients (WHO criteria) 13 had been treated in 14 acute general hospitals under HA. As per defined exclusion criteria, 468 patients were excluded for reasons shown in Table 1 , resulting in a final cohort of major corticosteroid groups consisting of 1287 patients.The demographic and clinical parameters of these 1287 patients from 14 acute hospitals in Hong Kong are shown in Table 2 . The majority of patients, totalling 1188 (92.3%), had received corticosteroid. Two hospitals had used centre-specific treatment protocols 3,5 on most of their patients throughout the outbreak, in which the dosages and types of corticosteroids used were clearly defined, while the other 12 hospitals had utilised two or more corticosteroid regimens. Patients were grouped based on the commonest corticosteroid types used in 1188 patients, in order of frequency, as follows: hydrocortisone (Group HC), methylprednisolone (Group MP), pulsed methylprednisolone (Group Pulse), and prednisolone (Group P). Only 99 patients received no steroid (Group No Steroid) and were distributed in 13 hospitals. A step-down strategy in corticosteroid dosages was observed in all steroid treatment groups unless deterioration occurred which called for the use of pulsed methylprednisolone rescue. Details of individual patients in the Group No Steriod were not retrieved, but to our knowledge some patients had minor disease diagnosed only on or after discharge (in particular in the early part of the outbreak before the virus was identified and diagnostic tests developed), some presented late in the course of the outbreak with atypical symptoms (such as diarrhoea), while some physicians did not believe in administering corticosteroid in this unknown disease. All baseline characteristics and clinical parameters on admission were statistically different among the groups (Table 2 ). In particular, Group P consisted of the youngest patients with the largest number of health care workers (47%) and the mildest disease on admission, as evidenced by the lowest median CXR score, normal respiratory status and absence of ARDS. Group MP had the highest median CXR score on admission. The two groups with the highest prevalence of ARDS on admission (8.3% and 8.2% for Groups Pulse and No Steroid, respectively) also had the highest mortality rates (30% and 28.3%, respectively). Overall, crude death rates were lowest for Group P and Group MP. Table 3aec shows the details of 1188 patients who had received corticosteroids. Table 3a shows that general characteristics were significantly different amongst the groups. Steroid commencement was earliest in Group HC and latest in Group Pulse [median Days 4 (IQR 3e6) and 6 (IQR 4e8), respectively, after symptom onset]. Among the groups, Group MP had the lowest proportion of patients requiring pulsed corticosteroid rescue (41% compared to 53e100% in the other groups), which was also given at the latest time point (median Day 9 after symptom onset, compared to Days 6e8 in the other groups). The total cumulative corticosteroid dosage was highest in Group Pulse, while duration of steroid treatment was shortest in Group P (median 15 days) and longest in Group MP (median 21 days), the latter of which was dictated by protocol. 3 Table 3b shows the patients' clinical parameters at corticosteroid commencement. Group P still had the mildest disease. Comparatively, Group MP and Group Pulse had the worst clinical status as evidenced by the highest percentages of patients with ARDS (9.4% and 18.1%, respectively) and the highest median CXR score [4 (IQR 2e7) and 5 (IQR 2e9), respectively]. Table 3c shows the clinical parameters at pulsed corticosteroid commencement. Group P consistently had the mildest disease, with the lowest median CXR score and only 12.4% of patients in either ALI or ARDS. In contrast, patients in Group MP had the worst clinical status with the highest median CXR score, with 45.9% having either ALI or ARDS.To remove possible confounding effects due to ribavirin, 68 patients not having been treated with ribavirin (50 from Group No Steroid, 11 from Group HC, 1 from Group MP, 5 from Group P and 1 from Group Pulse) were excluded from further analyses of the final outcomes. Among the 99 patients in Group No Steroid, comparison between the 50 patients who had not and the 49 who had received ribavirin by univariate analysis failed to show any significant difference in demographics and all other characteristics including co-morbidity, percentage with laboratory confirmation and percentage of health care workers, admission parameters (respiratory status, white cell count, neutrophils, LDH, CXR scores), as well as major outcomes (data not shown). Univariate comparisons of the characteristics between survivors and fatal cases among 1219 patients (Table 4 ) indicated that age, sex, comorbidity, worst respiratory status at Days 8 to 10, worst X-ray score, LDH ratio, WBC and neutrophil counts on admission and corticosteroid treatment reached statistical significance (P < 0.05).In 1032 patients with complete data for multivariate analysis, the aggregate effect of corticosteroid usage compared with Group No steroid on survival was insignificant after controlling for age, sex, co-morbidity, highest CXR score, worst respiratory status at Days 8e10 and WBC on admission. Fig. 1 shows that Group P had the lowest percentage of survivors who had positive bacterial cultures throughout hospitalisation. Group MP, which had received the highest total dosage of corticosteroid (Table 3a) , showed slightly higher rates after Days 1e7, and both these groups also had the highest survival rates. Groups HC, No Steroid and Pulse had comparatively higher culture rates after Day 22 and higher mortality rates. Group HC had the highest positive culture and antifungal treatment rates while Groups P and MP had similar low rates. New cases of tuberculosis were uncommon, and again the rate was highest for Group HC.  Discussion  The present study is the largest comprehensive review to date of the use of corticosteroids in SARS treatment. On multivariate analysis, corticosteroid use as a whole did not show survival benefit compared with no steroid use. However, when individual corticosteroid types were analysed, Group MP (intravenous methylprednisolone) conferred lower mortality compared with Group No Steroid, which is statistically significant. Among the corticosteroid groups, Group MP and Group P (oral prednisolone) showed similar survival outcome.These results should be interpreted with caution in the light of its limitations of being a retrospective study without control groups. Disparities of baseline characteristics could have been secondary to selection bias, i.e. the choice of corticosteroid use and dosage might have been related to severity of illness or the treatment protocols adopted by individual hospitals. We thus observed that steroid types and dosages had varied from protocol-driven low-dose prednisolone, 4 high-dose MP, 3 and even pulsed corticosteroid on commencement of treatment. 5 Although corticosteroids and ribavirin were usually given together, the effect of the latter was likely small, if any. 18e20 Predominant corticosteroid type was classified according to their use in the first four days, but subsequent use including rescue pulsed doses and the total dose and duration administered could also have confounded the final conclusion. We believe that the cytokine storm in the initial days of the SARS illness has the most critical effect on the manifestations of the disease 8, 21 and that an appropriate level of immunomodulation at this stage may have the most impact on the subsequent course of the illness. 8, 22 We have therefore arbitrarily classified our patients as described, which was also the most reasonable since the majority of patients given corticosteroid (1188, or 97.9%) could be classified. Also, PaO 2 and FiO 2 could only be estimated in most instances based on assumptions, nevertheless, the same rules were applied to every patient. Finally, while we have already excluded patients with experimental therapy (especially antivirals like lopinavir/ritonavir which may have beneficial effects 23 ) and those with 'do not resuscitate' orders, it is still possible for the outcome to be affected by different modes of subsequent management, including the choice of ventilatory strategy. Our results suggest that SARS patients given prednisolone and methylprednisolone had fared better than those given hydrocortisone. We speculate that this may be related to the comparatively higher anti-inflammatory potency of the former two drugs as demonstrated in in vitro studies. 24, 25 We observed that corticosteroid dosages employed for SARS in Hong Kong had been diverse, ranging from low dose regimens 4, 26 through dosages commonly employed in treating acute asthmatic attacks 1,6,27 and higher dosages triggered by surrogate markers of clinical deterioration, 3, 28 to pulsed MP dosages for treatment of acute autoimmune pulmonary vasculitis. 5 At first sight, it does appear intriguing that both lowdose (P) and high-dose (MP) groups should result in similarly low mortality rates in our study. On detailed analysis, however, it appeared that dosages had been tailored in accordance with disease severity: Group P (prednisolone) with the mildest clinical and radiographic parameters had received lower dosages of corticosteroid on steroid commencement, whereas Group MP with worse clinical status received higher initial dosages. The relative good outcomes of MP and P groups could be related to their lower cumulative doses compared to Groups HC and Pulse and hence more modest immunosuppressive effects. However, it must be pointed out that Group P had the mildest disease throughout hospital stay while Group MP had much more severe illness. Hence low cumulative dosages should not be the major reason for the better outcomes of these two groups. We speculate, therefore, that corticosteroid administered at dosages commensurate to disease severity may be conducive to effectively controlling immunopathological lung damage. In addition, our data do not support the contention that higher corticosteroids dosages as treatment for SARS would necessarily lead to an infection-prone immunocompromised state, because the high-dose protocol-driven 3 Group MP (methylprednisolone) had higher (worse) median CXR score on corticosteroid commencement but displayed low mortality rate and the lowest proportionate requirement for pulsed MP rescue. It also turned out to have consistently lower rates of positive bacterial and fungal cultures as well as anti-fungal treatment. That high dose methylprednisolone was more beneficial than no or lower dosages of corticosteroid has also been shown in a comparative study from mainland China. 29 As only two hospitals had used specific treatment protocols throughout the outbreak, while the other 12 had applied different regimens to different patients at different phases of the outbreak, definite conclusions about the effects of corticosteroids are difficult even though we have adjusted for most baseline differences using multivariate analysis.In most reported series in the literature, corticosteroids had been started to treat SARS at variable but usually much earlier time points. These included: as soon as the diagnosis of SARS was made and without response to antibiotics treatment within 48 h; 1 on confirming an epidemiological link or contact history; 5, 30 or on finding lung involvement on high-resolution CT thorax alone despite clear chest radiographs. 5, 6, 30 Such early corticosteroid administration strategies might have led to the drug being given too early in the viral replicative phase, which may result in aggravation and/or prolongation of viral replication and thus less satisfactory outcome. 5,6,30e32 We therefore submit that the low mortality and morbidity in Group MP may have resulted from effective control of severe disease by appropriately high dosages of corticosteroid with high anti-inflammatory activity given at a strategic timing as per protocol 3 to coincide with the period of high SARS-related immunopathological activity. This strategy would allow the smooth tailing down of corticosteroid dosages to avoid disease rebound as well as the risk of secondary infections during the subsequent phase of immunoparesis. 3, 28 In contrast, Group HC, which also received high cumulative corticosteroid dosages and had high proportions of patients requiring pulsed MP rescue, displayed the highest positivity for bacterial, fungal and tuberculosis infections. We postulate that comparatively weaker anti-inflammatory effects of hydrocortisone 24, 25 in these groups might have resulted in incomplete control of SARS and thus persistent elevation of cytokines at an earlier stage, which in turn may promote bacterial proliferation. 7, 33 In the same context, high cumulative corticosteroid dosages in the later stages of hospitalisation resulting from increased need for rescue dosages could also have contributed to excessive secondary infections among patients receiving hydrocortisone. Cytokine assays have not been specifically performed for the purpose of this study.Although definitive answers to the best timing, dosage and duration of corticosteroid administration can only be obtained in large-scale randomised placebo-controlled trial, in which a potentially effective antiviral agent is supplemented with corticosteroids as secondary or rescue treatment, our analyses do suggest that appropriate severityadjusted corticosteroid dosages, especially highdose methylprednisolone commenced only on overt respiratory deterioration in the more severe cases, were associated with better outcome in the management of severe acute respiratory syndrome.  			1		1			
31472768	Acute Illness in the Athlete	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126929/	Athletes are susceptible to many acute illnesses that can interfere with their ability to train and compete as well as potentially affecting teammates and coaching staff. A solid understanding of the preventive measures, diagnosis, and management of such diseases is paramount in the care of an athletic population.	Acute Illness in the Athlete  Carrie A. Jaworski, MD a,b, *, Valerie Rygiel, DO c Acute illnesses contracted by athletes typically mirror the type and timing of those seen in the general population; however, in athletes they can present as a significant health burden. When caring for acutely ill athletes, sports medicine providers need to consider how the illness can affect the athlete's training, performance, and competition schedule; the risk of transmission of the illness to other team members; and the necessary precautions and contraindications related to treatment of the athletes and their return to participation. In addition, it is necessary to recognize that athletes training at an elite level, or for more prolonged periods of time, may be more susceptible to illness as a facet of an overtraining syndrome. This article focuses on the impact of acute illness on athletes as well as highlighting special considerations of specific acute illnesses as they relate to athletes.  THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXERCISE AND IMMUNE FUNCTION  The proposed effects of exercise on immune function have typically been poorly understood. The literature supports both the positive and negative effects that exercise can have on immune function and risk of illness. [1] [2] [3] The risk of illness has been found to increase in situations of prolonged and/or intense training, especially in athletes who are already immunocompromised, have high levels of intrinsic or extrinsic stressors, or have had a recent infection. 4 However, most athletes training at a moderate level benefit from improved immune function and lower infection rates compared with people who do not exercise.Several theories have been proposed in the literature with regard to exercise and immune function, with the 2 most widely accepted being the J-curve model and the open-window theory. The J-curve model is based on evidence that moderate exercise enhances immune function compared with that of sedentary individuals, whereas excessive, intense exercise may paradoxically impair immune function. 2 This theory is generally accepted as true except in the case of elite, international-level, and medal-winning athletes, in whom high training levels do not impart a negative effect on performance. [5] [6] [7] The reasons for this are unclear, but are thought to be related to self-selection, whereby this group of athletes possess immune systems able to withstand the highest levels of physiologic and psychological stressors, which results in what is referred to as an S-curve phenomenon 8 (Fig. 1) .The open-window theory proposes that the immune system is temporarily downregulated for a period of time after strenuous exercise, leading to a window in which the risk of infection increases. The depressive effect on immune function can last between 3 and 24 hours after exercise, depending on intensity and duration of the exercise, with greater suppression seen with more intense and prolonged bouts of exercise 9 (Fig. 2) .Despite these theories, there is limited evidence that showing a direct correlation between exercise-induced impaired immune function and an increased incidence of clinically confirmed infection. 1  ILLNESS AND PERFORMANCE  Acute illnesses in athletes stand to affect performance through a variety of mechanisms. Infections occurring during the peak of an athlete's season can impair the athlete's competitive performance because of being limited by symptoms, such as with a persistent cough, as well as via deconditioning from lost training time. In contrast, an infection early in the season is less likely to impart significant consequences because any decline in performance can typically be regained quickly once the illness resolves. Respiratory symptoms such as cough and bronchospasm can directly affect ventilation and aerobic capacity as well as incite anxiety in the athlete because of either a real A B or perceived inability to oxygenate properly. Fever impairs the ability to regulate body temperature, which increases fluid losses and can affect both stroke volume and cardiac output, affecting maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2max ). Muscle wasting, impaired coordination, and decreased strength that results from an acute illness can also affect performance as well as increase risk of injury. Studies have also shown that deconditioning of the cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, and metabolic systems can occur in athletes with less than 4 weeks off from training. 10 The effects are greatest, and occur most quickly, in the most highly trained athletes, sometimes beginning after only 4 to 5 days. 11 VO 2max can decline between 6% and 20% with deconditioning in highly trained athletes, affecting ventilatory efficiency and endurance. 12 Such decreases in exercise performance can last for 2 to 4 days beyond the complete resolution of an upper respiratory illness in athletes. 13 Research has shown that maintenance of low-level activity, when appropriate, can be used to fend off some of the physiologic changes associated with complete cessation of activity and should be considered in select cases. 12 Overtraining and Risk of IllnessThe concept of overtraining cannot be ignored because it relates to risk of illness in athletes. Training philosophy centers on the idea of functional overreaching, whereby athletes push beyond normal limits in order to adapt to these higher loads and achieve gains in their sports. In order for this overreaching to benefit the athlete, adequate recovery needs to be factored into the equation. In situations in which there is not enough recovery, the athletes fail to improve and may see detrimental effects on their performance either in the form of nonfunctional overreaching or, in more extreme cases, overtraining syndrome. It is here that they are more susceptible to associated rates of increased illness and injury.Experts have also acknowledged that the congested training and competition schedules of athletes, along with frequent travel, can lend themselves to both psychological and physiologic stress. These stressors can negatively affect health by increasing the risk of both overtraining syndrome as well as of contracting an acute illness. 14 The International Olympic Committee convened an expert consensus group in 2015 that examined these constructs and concluded that the relationship between athletes' health and the loads placed on them should be seen as a well-being continuum along which load and recovery are mutual counteragents. 14, 15 The amount of external and internal loads in the form of both sports-related and non-sports-related stressors places the athletes along a spectrum of health from homeostasis to acute fatigue, overreaching, overtraining syndromes and eventual immune changes, illness, and/or injury. With proper recognition of this disruption of the athlete's homeostasis, usually caused by having to stop for an illness or injury, rest can be initiated, resulting in recovery and return to homeostasis. If symptoms are ignored, this homeostasis remains out of balance and the athlete remains at risk for decreased performance and further illness/injury.  RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS Upper Respiratory Tract Infection  Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are the most common illnesses to affect both athletic and nonathletic populations alike. It has been reported that a typical adult is afflicted with a URTI 1 to 6 times per year. 9 Research indicates that more than 50% of acute illnesses reported during athletic competitions affect the upper respiratory tract. 14 Most URTIs are self-limited viral illnesses and their evaluation and treatment in athletes are typically the same as those of nonathletes. There are special considerations in athletes with regard to medication choices as well as appropriate timing of return to play.  Cause  Most URTIs are in the category of the common cold and are caused by rhinoviruses. However, there are several other causative agents to consider because URTIs can also include the following illnesses: bronchitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, influenza, infectious mononucleosis, and pertussis. Infections tend to occur in early autumn through early spring, with the greatest frequency occurring in the winter months. Athletes may be more at risk if they frequently travel for their sports, compete indoors, or have close contact with teammates and/or opponents. Rates of URTIs in athletes increase in the winter months, most likely because of crowding indoors, seasonal variations in pathogens, and physiologic changes that occur because of the cold. [16] [17] [18] In addition, athletes may be more susceptible to URTIs if they are under increased psychosocial stress, are undergoing a personal crisis, or are experiencing any type of sleep disturbance. 19, 20 Diagnosis and treatment URTIs are generally self-limited viral illnesses with the symptoms of rhinorrhea, sore throat, fatigue, nasal congestion, mildly increased temperature, and cough resolving within 7 to 10 days. The diagnosis is typically a clinical one that does not require testing, unless symptoms are prolonged or worsening and other pathogens are being considered.Treatments often include over-the-counter medications, such as analgesics, antipyretics, and decongestants to aid in relief of symptoms, but these should be used judiciously ( Table 1) . Expectorants are generally considered safe and can help to thin mucus production. Antipyretics are also appropriate but should not be used solely to control a fever in order to allow participation. Caution should be used with firstgeneration antihistamines because they exert an anticholinergic effect that can result in fatigue, dehydration, and/or heat issues. Care should also be taken when using oral decongestants in athletes because of risk of dehydration and hyperthermia, as well as restrictions on their use by certain sport governing bodies. Bronchodilators may be used short term to help with URTI-associated bronchospasm but are prohibited for use in some sports. Practitioners should always refer to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Web site for the most up-to-date list of prohibited substances if they are treating an Olympic sport athlete. 21Viruses are the causative agent in acute bronchitis 90% of the time, 9, 22 and include influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, and metapneumovirus. Bacterial causes include Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Testing seldom needs to be performed to confirm the diagnosis because the diagnosis is made clinically from cough. Fever is unusual in most cases, but can be seen with influenza and pneumonia. Coughs of greater than 3 weeks should prompt investigation for pertussis, keeping in mind that a persistent cough can also be caused by asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, and postnasal drip. 23 Treatment Treatment of acute bronchitis is directed at symptom relief in most cases. Evidence does not support the routine use of antibiotics. 23 Many athletes, and their coaches, expect antibiotics and it is important to educate them on the rationale for not doing so, which includes the avoidance of both antibiotic-associated diarrhea and antibiotic resistance. 23Pertussis is an infection caused by the bacterium B pertussis. It is typically spread person to person through aerosolized respiratory droplets. Infections in adults are usually mild and self-limited; nonetheless, a persistent cough can have a significant impact on an athlete's performance in most sports.Influenza subtypes A and B can be identified by rapid nasal swabs. Type B viruses only infect humans and mutate 2 to 3 times slower, resulting in a classically weaker strain that does not cause rapid spread. However, type A viruses are more virulent and can have many different animal hosts. The 2009 pandemic of H1N1 was credited with up to 403,000 hospitalizations, compared with the 200,000 seen in a typical flu season, and highlighted the challenges of not having an available vaccine against this influenza A strain. 29 Despite this, the concerted efforts of the US health care system to guide strong educational initiatives on hand washing, adherence to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) isolation guidelines, and the early reporting of symptoms helped to create awareness and contained many H1N1 outbreaks at the high school, collegiate, and professional sports levels. 30 In 2017, the CDC reported that nearly 2.3 million cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis were diagnosed in the United States, marking the fourth consecutive year of sharp increases in these diseases. 52 Regardless, human papillomavirus (HPV) is still the most common sexually transmitted disease despite vaccine availability.  Prophylaxis  There is little in terms of preventive treatments against a URTI other than educating the athlete on maintenance of healthy lifestyle habits, such as consuming a nutritious diet, getting adequate sleep, not sharing water bottles, avoiding contact with infected individuals, and the practice of consistent hand washing and good coughing etiquette. Research is ongoing in terms of methods to monitor athletes for subclinical warning signs related to impending illness. At present, coaches and sports medicine staff should ensure adequate recovery is built into training programs, monitor for early signs of overload/overtraining such as fatigue and decreased performance, educate athletes on and encourage healthy habits/hygiene, and provide adequate time for administration of influenza vaccines and other needed immunizations related to travel (Fig. 3) .As with most URTIs, there are no known preventive measures other than maintaining a healthy immune system and reducing the spread of infection, as described in Fig. 3 .Vaccination against influenza is the most important prevention strategy. ACIP recommends universal vaccination for those greater than 6 months of age. 34 Athletes and associated coaching staff members should be highly encouraged to obtain an influenza vaccine early because development of immunoprotection can take up to 5 weeks. In addition, vaccines should generally be scheduled in the off season, or as far away from important competitions as is possible.Several studies have suggested that drinking cranberry juice may decrease the incidence of UTIs. A recent meta-analysis from 2017 found that cranberry reduced the risk for UTI by 26% in otherwise healthy nonpregnant women with a history of UTIs.Studies reviewed were small in sample size, most with fewer than 300 participants. A larger, higher-quality study is needed for further investigation. 51The USPSTF recommends behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and adults with safe sex practices as a preventive measure for sexually transmitted diseases. In addition, there is currently a vaccine available for both men and women to protect against HPV. Gardasil is recommended starting at age 9 years, and recent change in US Food and Drug Administration regulations allow it to be administered up to age 45 years. Although the vaccine does not protect against all strains of the HPV virus, it offers protection against several of the high-risk strains. 52  Acute bronchitis  Acute bronchitis refers to a cough of infectious origin that lasts for more than 10 days but less than 3 weeks. A persistent cough can wreak havoc on an athlete's performance and training so there is often pressure on the medical team to find a solution.  Pertussis  As previously mentioned, athletes with a cough lasting greater than 3 weeks warrant further evaluation. Although there are many potential causes of chronic cough, one highly infectious source that needs to be considered is pertussis.  Diagnosis  It can be difficult for clinicians to distinguish pertussis from other causes of chronic cough. Classic pertussis infection is described as having 3 phases of illness: catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent. The catarrhal phase lasts 1 to 2 weeks and is characterized by a mild, intermittent cough, low-grade fevers, and coryza. In the paroxysmal phase, infected individuals experience a spasmodic cough, posttussive emesis, and an inspiratory whoop. This phase can range from 1 to 6 weeks in duration. The convalescent phase is when the symptoms begin to subside, typically over 7 to 10 days, but they can last for months. 24 The classic symptoms of posttussive emesis and whoop are rarely seen in clinical practice and, although their presence increases the specificity of pertussis, it is not enough to definitively diagnose pertussis. 25 Confirmatory testing for pertussis is via a nasopharyngeal swab, which can be sent for either culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results from culture have poor sensitivity and specificity and can take several days to obtain. PCR is costlier, but much quicker, with results available in 1 to 2 days. Because of such limitations, most suspected cases are treated based on patient presentation and ideally include known recent exposure to a confirmed index case. 25, 26 TreatmentThe earlier treatment of pertussis is started, the better. If the patient is able to start treatment in the first 1 to 2 weeks, before the onset of the coughing paroxysms, symptoms may be lessened. For this reason, clinicians should strongly consider treating based on clinical suspicion rather than waiting for confirmatory testing. B pertussis is considered contagious from the start of the catarrhal stage through the third week, after the onset of the paroxysmal phase, or until 5 days after the start of appropriate antibiotic treatment. 25 Antibiotic treatment that is started late does not alter the course of the illness and is unnecessary because pertussis is no longer considered infectious after w21 days.Macrolides are first-line agents for the treatment of pertussis, with trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole being used when macrolides are contraindicated. Erythromycin was traditionally prescribed for 14 days, but, because of significant side effects and the lack of most people's ability to comply with a 4-times-per-day medication, azithromycin is more often chosen for treatment. In confirmed cases of pertussis, teammates and coaches should receive postexposure prophylaxis with the same macrolide treatment course. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) states that once treatment of pertussis is initiated, the individual needs to be isolated for the first 5 days of antibiotic treatment. Therefore, athletes with pertussis need to be removed from contact with teammates and staff. Health care providers are mandated to report any confirmed cases. 25, 27 Prophylaxis There continue to be high rates of pertussis cases among teens and young adults despite improved immunization rates. These high rates are thought to be in part caused by a change from a live pertussis vaccine to an acellular version of the vaccine in the 1990s. 24 Based on these continued high rates of infection, the Advisory Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends a booster vaccine for adolescents and adults. 27,28 ACIP recommends a single Tdap dose for persons aged 11 to 18 years who have completed the primary series and for adults 19 to 64 years regardless of their last vaccine tetanus or diphtheria toxoid. In addition, pregnant women should receive a booster with each pregnancy, preferably between 27 and 36 weeks' gestation. 28 In the athletic setting, providers should be educating their athletes and staff about the importance of this vaccination.Classic influenza patients present with fever, dry cough, headache, and myalgias. Additional complaints can include a sore throat, rhinorrhea, and congestion. Diagnostic testing for influenza is typically not required in the care of the general Jaworski & Rygiel population; however, confirming the diagnosis in athletes can be invaluable in prevention of a larger outbreak within an athletic program. Nasal washings or a pharyngeal swab should be obtained in an athlete presenting with the presumed index case during the influenza season. Once the index case is confirmed, any additional athletes with influenzalike symptoms can be presumed to also have influenza.The diagnosis of TD is typically made clinically and the pathogen is rarely isolated before symptoms resolve on their own. The diagnosis and approach to treatment used to be based on the number of unformed stools but now is based on a functional classification scheme (Fig. 5) . Stool cultures should be obtained if the TD lasts greater than 7 days or the patient has fever or colitis symptoms (fever, tenesmus, urgency, cramping, or bloody diarrhea). 37, 38 TreatmentThe mainstay of treatment of TD is fluid replacement. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for athletes that develop moderate to severe diarrhea, which is clinically classified by the International Society of Travel Medicine as distressing and interfering with planned activities; fever; or blood, pus, or mucus in the stool. Self-treatment with antibiotics for milder cases has been shown to increase microbial resistance. 39 In general, fluoroquinolones are avoided for treatment of TD in the athletic setting, because of potential effects on the musculoskeletal system, including the rare but worrisome risk of tendon rupture in athletes. Azithromycin has been shown to be as effective for TD as fluoroquinolones and is now the preferred agent. 40 Azithromycin is given as a 1000-mg single dose or as 500 mg daily for 3 days. In TD caused by E coli, rifaximin has been shown to be effective; however, it is not for use with any febrile diarrhea or dysentery. 41 If a parasitic cause is suspected, metronidazole 500 mg 3 times daily for 5 days is the preferred regimen. The use of antimotility agents such as loperamide and diphenoxylate has been considered controversial in the past, but it is now generally accepted as safe when taken with an antibiotic. 9 More conservative recommendations for use in athletes suggest reserving it for use only preceding a competition or during a long trip. 42 A summary of the recommendations for TD treatment can be found in Table 2 .The diagnosis of UTI can often be accomplished by patient history alone. Female athletes presenting with symptoms of dysuria and frequency have a 90% probability of UTI and may be treated empirically without further testing. Cystitis in male athletes and atypical/vague symptoms in either gender warrant laboratory testing with urinalysis and urine culture to confirm the diagnosis. 46Symptomatic athletes or those exposed to sexually transmitted diseases should be tested. For routine health maintenance, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for sexually transmitted diseases in asymptomatic individuals according to Table 3 . All sexually active women up to the age of 24 years, or older women that are at increased risk, should be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea. However, for asymptomatic men, there is insufficient evidence to screen. Syphilis is tested for in any individual deemed to be at increased risk, including suspected exposure, decreased immune system, or pregnancy. HPV is only screened for in women between the ages of 30 and 65 years in the form of cotesting during pap smears. Before the age of 30 years, most women can clear HPV infections, therefore it is not recommended to routinely test. 53  Influenza  Influenza is an extremely contagious viral respiratory illness that can spread quickly through an athletic program. The virus is easily transmitted via respiratory droplets, causing athletes to be at increased risk based on their close proximity to others during practice, competitions, and travel.  Treatment  Otherwise healthy individuals infected with influenza usually have complete resolution with only symptomatic treatment. 31 Symptom improvement is seen between days 3 and 7, although cough and malaise can last days longer. Neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) can be used to treat influenza A and B, but in order to provide maximum effectiveness these medications need to be started within 48 hours of symptom onset. 32, 33 Resistance to these medications is variable and changes over time.Neuraminidase inhibitors are often considered for chemoprophylaxis in high-risk household contacts. In the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, athletes did not qualify for chemoprophylaxis based on CDC guidelines because they were not considered high-risk contacts, mainly because of a fear of antiviral shortages during the pandemic. In situations in which medication shortages are not a concern, clinicians should consider prophylaxis of an in-season sports team and their close contacts if a team member has confirmed influenza.First-line antimicrobial agents include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and nitrofurantoin. Choice of agent often comes down to factors such as patient allergies, tolerance of the medication, or local resistance patterns. Of note, TMP-SMX has seen a large increase in the rate of resistance in the past 30 years. 47 Resistance rates vary based on geography, but TMP-SMX is still considered a first-line choice when rates are less than 20%. 47 Women with uncomplicated infection are treated with a 3-day course of antibiotics. 48, 49 Men with cystitis require both a urinalysis and urine culture for their work-up, along with a 7-day course of therapy. 50The CDC recommendations for treatments for sexually transmitted diseases are listed in Table 4 . Treatment of gonorrhea now includes dual-antibiotic therapy with the addition of azithromycin because of emerging antibiotic resistance to ceftriaxone alone. In the treatment of syphilis, the only approved therapy is penicillin by intramuscular injection. For individuals allergic to penicillin, the recommendation is to undergo desensitization because there is no alternative medication. HPV is managed with lesion destruction, including cryotherapy and topical erosive agents. 53  Respiratory Tract Infections and General Guidelines For Return To Play  Athletes with mild viral URTI can often continue to train and compete as tolerated provided that the severity and symptoms of the illness do not worsen with exercise. 19 Absolute contraindications to participation include fever, hypoxia, and dehydration. Practitioners should also take note of any athlete with unexplained sinus tachycardia because this is frequently the only sign of a viral-induced myocarditis after URTI. 35 The so-called neck check has long been used as a guideline for when athletes may return to sport. If the symptoms are all above the neck, such as with rhinorrhea, sore throat, and nasal congestion, the athlete can attempt a return to activity. The athlete should start with a brief attempt at light exercise for 10 to 15 minutes, which can then be increased as tolerated assuming there is no worsening of the athlete's symptoms. If symptoms exist that are below the neck, such as fever, malaise, and gastrointestinal symptoms, the athlete should be kept from participation until symptoms have resolved. 20 Fever is a particularly concerning symptom that should not be masked with medication to allow participation. Athletes should be afebrile for at least 24 hours off any antipyretics before consideration for return to play.When treating a bacterial infection such as sinusitis or pharyngitis, the athlete should be afebrile and on antibiotics for at least 24 hours before considering return to participation. 35 After this, a short trial of light activity can be undertaken and, if there is no effect on symptoms, then participation may be continued. However, if there is aggravation of significant symptoms, activity should be halted. Progression back to activity should be tailored to match the degree of illness that the athlete experienced. A good general rule of thumb is that for every day missed of training, the athlete should allow 2 to 3 days of graded return. The progression should also increase in small increments along the lines of 10% at a time, with frequency being increased first, followed by duration, and then intensity 35 (Fig. 4) .  Traveler's Diarrhea  Traveler's diarrhea (TD) is an illness that affects up to 40% of travelers to resourcelimited countries or regions. This risk includes athletes who travel to compete at the national or international level. Although TD is usually self-limited, the risk of secondary dehydration can adversely affect the athlete's ability to train and compete. Classically, TD presents with 3 or more unformed stools, nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal cramping, or bloody stools. Most cases occur within the first 4 to 14 days of travel and last between 1 and 5 days. 36 Cause Acute TD can be caused by 3 different infectious agents: bacteria, viruses, or parasites. About 90% of cases are bacterial, with most of those being caused by enterotoxic Escherichia coli. 37 Additional bacterial pathogens to consider include Salmonella species, Shigella species, Vibrio species, and Campylobacter species. Viruses cause up to 10% of TD cases, with Norovirus being the most frequent cause in adults. Parasitic organisms should also be considered in athletes with symptoms lasting longer than 7 days. Although only accounting for a small percentage of TD overall, common parasites include Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Cyclospora cayetanensis. 9  Prophylaxis and special considerations  Although antibiotics can be used effectively as prophylaxis in TD, they should not be used routinely. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be reserved for athletes that have underlying health conditions, such as severe inflammatory bowel disease, advanced human immunodeficiency virus, or complicated organ transplant, that would put them at high risk of morbidity if they developed TD. If prophylaxis is needed for an athlete, rifaximin is the antibiotic currently recommended at either 200 mg daily, twice daily, or 3 times daily because of a much lower side effect profile than the fluoroquinolones. 43 Before travel to high-risk regions, athletes should be educated on prudent selection of food and drinks. Selecting only bottled water or carbonated canned drinks, both consumed from the bottle with a straw rather than from a glass, as well as only eating fully cooked hot food and fruit that is peeled by the eater can minimize risk. Avoidance of buffets, condiments, ice, and food provided on international return flights are additional measures that should be taken while athletes are traveling. Of course, proper handwashing and avoidance of sharing utensils or glassware are also necessary to minimize risk.  Return to play  The return-to-play plan can be initiated once an athlete is afebrile, rehydrated, and back to tolerating solid foods with no residual gastrointestinal symptoms. Care should be taken to progress slowly through conditioning and then more intense training to allow for any possible deconditioning that occurred, following the same guidelines as outlined for URTIs.Athletes should be restricted from participation until they are afebrile, hydration is restored, and urinary symptoms have resolved. Uncomplicated UTI in female athletes should not significantly hamper training if treatment is started at the onset of symptoms. More serious cases require the athletes to have completed their antibiotic treatment and may warrant a graduated return to participation to account for possible deconditioning.  Urinary Tract Infections  Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequently seen condition that affects women much more often than men. One-third of all women experience at least 1 UTI before the age of 24 years, and is therefore a common reason for female high school and college athletes to seek medical attention. 44 Cause E coli is the most common cause of UTI in both men and women and accounts for 75% to 95% of cases in women. Less common pathogens include other Enterobacteriaceae, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. In athletes with recent hospitalizations or antimicrobial use, organisms such as Pseudomonas, enterococci, and staphylococci should be considered as well. 45   Sexually transmitted infections  Sexually transmitted infections continue to plague society, with individuals 15 to 24 years old accounting for half of all new infections. Because many athletes are within this age range, educational initiatives are paramount in preventing spread of disease. 52   Return to Play  Return-to-play guidelines are based on the cause and severity of infection. Uncomplicated infections, such as chlamydial or gonorrheal urethritis/cervicitis/rectal disease, rarely warrant exclusion from participation. Any complications, such as epididymitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, or disseminated gonococcal disease, should result in the athlete being held from competition until all symptoms have resolved. Once symptoms are resolved, the athlete can partake in a graduated return-to-play progression. 52  SUMMARY  Understanding the impact that an acute illness can impart on an athlete's training and performance, as well as the caveats in creating a treatment and return-to-play plan, is essential when providing care to athletes. The general principles of returning an athlete to training should center on ensuring a gradual progression that takes into account any deconditioning that occurred over the course of the illness. Staying up to date on the best treatment approaches as well as monitoring for any signs or symptoms of overtraining helps to keep athletes in the game.   							1	
22634277	Molecular and phylogenetic analysis of bovine coronavirus based on the spike glycoprotein gene	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7106151/	Abstract Bovine coronavirus has been associated with diarrhoea in newborn calves, winter dysentery in adult cattle and respiratory tract infections in calves and feedlot cattle. In Cuba, the presence of BCoV was first reported in 2006. Since then, sporadic outbreaks have continued to occur. This study was aimed at deepening the knowledge of the evolution, molecular markers of virulence and epidemiology of BCoV in Cuba. A total of 30 samples collected between 2009 and 2011 were used for PCR amplification and direct sequencing of partial or full S gene. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic studies were conducted using partial or complete S gene sequences as phylogenetic markers. All Cuban bovine coronavirus sequences were located in a single cluster supported by 100% bootstrap and 1.00 posterior probability values. The Cuban bovine coronavirus sequences were also clustered with the USA BCoV strains corresponding to the GenBank accession numbers EF424621 and EF424623, suggesting a common origin for these viruses. This phylogenetic cluster was also the only group of sequences in which no recombination events were detected. Of the 45 amino acid changes found in the Cuban strains, four were unique.	Introduction  Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) was first identified in association with diarrhoea in newborn calves (Mebus et al., 1973) and later associated with winter dysentery (WD) in adult cattle (Saif et al., 1991) and respiratory tract infections in calves and feedlot cattle (Storz et al., 2000) . Although the affected animals rarely die, coronavirus infection causes dramatic reductions in milk production in dairy herds and loss of body condition in both calves and adults (Saif et al., 1998) , resulting in severe economic losses. Thus, BCoV is currently considered an important pathogen that causes enteric disease, often in combination with clinical respiratory signs.BCoV is included in the genus Betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae, which, together with the families Arteriviridae and Roniviridae, constitute the order Nidovirales (International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV): http://talk.ictvonline.org/cfsfilesystemfile.ashx/key/CommunityServer.Components.PostAttachments/00.00.00.06.26/2008.085_2D00_122V.01.Coronaviridae. pdf). The BCoV genome consists of a single molecule of linear, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of 31 kb in length that is transcribed into a nested set of several 3 0 -coterminal subgenomic mRNAs that produce both non-structural and structural proteins (Chouljenko et al., 2001) . The virion contains five structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the transmembrane (M) protein, the small envelope (E) protein, the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein and the spike (S) protein (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) .The S glycoprotein is important for viral entry and pathogenesis, forms large petal-shaped spikes on the surface of the virion and is cleaved into S1 (N-terminus) and S2 (C-terminus) subunits (Abraham et al., 1990) . The S1 is the globular subunit and is responsible for virus binding to host-cell receptors (Kubo et al., 1994) , the induction of neutralising antibody expression (Yoo and Deregt, 2001) and haemagglutinin activity (Schultze et al., 1991) . It's sequences are variable, and mutations in this region have been associated with changes in antigenicity and viral pathogenicity (Ballesteros et al., 1997) . On the other hand, the S2 is the transmembrane subunit and is required to mediate the fusion of viral and cellular membranes (Luo and Weiss, 1998) .Variations in the host range and tissue tropism of the coronaviruses have been largely attributable to variations in the S glycoprotein (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001) . Therefore, to identify biological, antigenic and genetic characteristics that are distinct between respiratory and enteric BCoV strains, several studies based on partial or complete S gene sequences have been conducted Decaro et al., 2008; Hasoksuz et al., 2002; Kanno et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2006) . Although no clear markers have been established, comparative nucleotide sequence analyses have been useful for investigating the molecular phylogeny of BCoV Decaro et al., 2008; Kanno et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2006) .In Cuba, the presence of BCoV was first reported in 2006 ( Barrera et al., 2006) , and sporadic outbreaks have continued to occur since that time (Martínez et al., 2010) .In this study, sequence comparisons and phylogenetic studies based on S gene sequences were performed to deepen the knowledge of the evolution, potential molecular markers of virulence and epidemiology of BCoV in Cuba.  Samples collection  A total of 30 faecal samples from dairy and beef cows that were affected with enteric manifestations resembling WD were selected from a total of 136 samples that were sent to the Animal Virology Group of the CENSA for BCoV diagnosis. The samples for this study were selected based on the geographic region of origin and the year of the collection (Fig. 1 ).  Laboratory procedure  To inactivate potential RT-PCR inhibitors contained in the faecal samples, the faeces were diluted in nuclease-free water (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at a ratio of 3:1 (v/v). The final suspensions were centrifuged at 5000g for 10 min at 4°C. RNA was extracted from 250 lL of supernatant recovered using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen™/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the RNA pellet was diluted in 30 lL of nuclease-free water (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).First-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesised using Moloney-Murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase (M-MLV RT) (Invitrogen) and random primers (50 ng/lL) (Invitrogen) in a 20 lL final reaction volume. The cDNA of each sample was screened for the BCoV genome using the PCR method described by Tsunemitsu et al. (1999) .  Sequencing  In the first approach, the hypervariable region of the S1 gene (approx. 488 bp) was amplified from BCoV-positive samples using the primer pairs reported by Souza et al. (2010) and the reaction conditions described by Brandão et al. (2006) . The full S gene was then amplified from four positive samples (see samples marked with asterisk in Fig. 1 ) using several primer pairs (Table 1) . Each fragment of the S gene was amplified in a reaction volume of 50 lL containing 10 lL cDNA, 2.5 U Platinum Ò Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 200 lM of each dNTP, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 and 0.5 lM of each primer.The resulting amplicons were purified from agarose gels using a GFX PCR DNA and GEL BAND Purification Kit Ò (GE Healthcare) and submitted to bi-directional DNA sequencing using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit following the manufacturer's directions (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing products were read on an ABI PRISM-3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The sense and antisense sequences obtained from each amplicon were assembled, and a consensus sequence for each gene was generated using the ChromasPro V1.5 program (Technelysium Pvt. Ltd., 2009). Nucleotide BLAST analysis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/ Blast.cgi) was initially used to verify the identity of each fragment sequence obtained. The sequences were submitted to the Gen-Bank database under accession numbers HE616734-HE616737 for the hypervariable region and HE616738-HE616741 for the full S gene.   Model selection  ModelTest V.3.0.6 (Posada and Crandall, 1998 ) was used to estimate the best-fit model using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The best-fit model for each phylogenetic marker was selected and used for phylogenetic analysis.  Likelihood mapping  The phylogenetic signal of each sequence dataset was investigated by the likelihood mapping analysis of 100,000 random quartets generated using TreePuzzle (Strimmer and von Haeseler, 1997) . In this strategy, if more than 30% of the dots fall into the centre of the triangle, the data are considered unreliable for the purposes of phylogenetic inference.The phylogenetic noise in each data set was investigated by means of likelihood mapping. The percentage of dots falling in the central area of the triangles ranged from 0.3% for the full S gene to 13.1% for the hypervariable S1 region. None of the datasets showed more than 30% noise, which enabled the use of the hypervariable S1 region, S1 region or full S gene to deduce the phylogenetic signal.  Phylogenetic trees  Phylogenetic relationships among partial or complete S gene sequences of unique BCoV isolates were analysed using the Bayesian Inference (BI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) methodologies. Bayesian inference analyses were performed with the software MrBayes 3.1 (Huelsenbeck et al., 2001; Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003) . The MCMC searches were run with four chains for 5 million generations, with sampling of the Markov chain every 100 generations. At the end of each run, the convergence of the chains was inspected through the average standard deviation of split frequencies and the first 15% of the trees were discarded. After burn-in, the convergence was again assessed based on the effective sampling size (ESS) using Tracer software version 1.4 (http://tree. bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/). Only ESS values of >250 were accepted. Bayesian trees with clade credibility for each marker were constructed using the posterior probability distribution. The trees were rooted using the Human-OC43 strain sequence (accession number NC005147). Finally, ML trees were computed using the PHYML v3.0 (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003) , and confidence levels were estimated by 1000 bootstrap replicates.  Comparison of topologies  The topologies were tested by the Kishino and Hasegawa test (K-H) (Kishino and Hasegawa, 1989 ) and the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (S-H) (Shimodaira and Hasegawa, 1999) , which computed the log-likelihoods per site for each tree and compare the total log-likelihoods for each proposed topology, using the PAM-Lv4.3 program (Yang, 2007) . Ten thousand replicates were performed using the K-H and S-H topologies test by re-sampling the estimated log-likelihoods for each site (RELL model) (Kishino et al., 1990) .  Recombination analyses  Searches for recombinant sequences and crossover regions in the BCoV S gene were performed using Geneconv (Padidam et al., 1999) , RDP (Martin and Rybicki, 2000) , MaxChi (Maynard Smith, 1992; Posada and Crandall, 2001) , Chimera (Posada and Crandall, 2001) , BootScan (Martin et al., 2005) , SiScan (Gibbs et al., 2000) , 3Seq (Boni et al., 2007) and LARD (Holmes et al., 1999) , all implemented in RDP3 Beta 41 (Heath et al., 2006) . All unique full S gene sequences available in the GenBank database were downloaded on December 1st, 2011 and tested. Programs were executed with modified parameter settings determined according to the guidelines in the RDP3 manual for the analysis of divergent sequences (available upon request). Recombinant sequences were tested by examining the S genes with a highest acceptable p value of 0.05, and Bonferroni's multiple comparison correction was used. Analyses were conducted twice to ensure the repeatability of results.A recombination analysis of the complete S gene was performed from the dataset used. The recombination breakpoints were determined using the RDP3 program. The sequences representing recombinant mosaic and major recombinant parental types are listed in Supplementary Table S1 . Surprisingly, the Cuban BCoV strain sequences and a group of USA BCoV strain sequences with GenBank accession numbers AF391542, DQ915164, FJ938064, EF424621, EF424623, EF424615 and EF424616 were the only sequences in which no recombination events were detected (Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. 2c ). All remaining BCoV strains whose complete S gene sequences are available in the GenBank database have at least one recombination event for this gene.  Multiple amino acid alignment  The full S gene sequences of each Cuban isolate were aligned with sequences available from the GenBank database, including S gene sequences from respiratory and enteric strains, sequences that showed closer phylogenetic relationships and the reference strain Mebus. The alignment was performed using the ClustalW method in the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor (Hall, 1999) . In addition, the amino acid sequences for each gene of the Cuban isolates were obtained and compared using the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor (Hall, 1999) .The N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted with the N-Gly-coSite web-based utility (http://hcv.lanl.gov/content/hcv-db/GLY-COSITE/glycosite.html), and the hydrophobicity profile was generated using the software package DAMBE v5.1.1 (http:// web.hku.hk/_xxia/software/software.html) according to the Kyte and Doolittle method.  Sequence identity analysis  The nucleotide sequence identities of the S1 hypervariable region among the eight Cuban BCoV sequences obtained ranged from 99.4% to 100% and the deduced amino acid deduced ranged from 99.2% to 100%. Meanwhile, the four S complete gene sequences shared sequence identities ranging from 99.7% to 100% and 99.5% to 100% for nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences, respectively. The BLASTn analysis for both the S1 hypervariable region and complete S gene showed the highest nucleotide sequence identities, 98% and 99%, respectively, with the BCoV strain identified as US/OH1/2003 (accession number EF424621), which was detected in a wild animal park in Ohio, USA.  Phylogenetic analyses  The phylogenetic relationships among the BCoV strains were reconstructed by ML and BI analyses. The Bayesian tree was the best (S-H test ÀLn = 12018.922⁄) when S complete sequences were used as phylogenetic markers, but the support for this tree was not significantly different for the ML tree, with ÀLn values ranging from 12018.922 to 12021.478. The ML tree was the best (S-H test ÀLn = 7286.532 ⁄ ) when S1 sequences were used as phylogenetic markers, but the support for this tree was not significantly different for the Bayesian tree, with ÀLn values ranging from 7286.532 to 7309.785. Therefore, regardless of the phylogenetic method used or phylogenetic marker employed, all tree topologies were identical (Fig. 2a-c) and were supported by moderate to high confidence values.The phylogenetic relationships constructed based on the hypervariable region of the S1 gene (approx. 488 bp), revealed that the eight Cuban BCoV strains were closely related (Fig. 2a) . All Cuban BCoV strains were located in a same cluster along with the USA BCoV strains with GenBank accession numbers EF424621 and EF424624, suggesting a common origin. These phylogenetic relationships were supported by moderate to high confidence values (Fig. 2a) .The phylogenetic trees based on the complete S gene and the S1 region yielded the same phylogenetic relationships for the Cuban BCoV strains, which were similar to the phylogenetic trees obtained from the hypervariable region of the S1 gene. Thus, all Cuban BCoV strains were located in a same cluster, supported by 100% bootstrap values and 1.00 posterior probability values ( Fig. 2b and c) . In addition, the Cuban BCoV strains were located in the same cluster as the USA BCoV strains EF424621 and EF424623, suggesting a common origin.  Molecular characterisation  The deduced amino acid sequences of the full S genes of the four Cuban BCoV field strains were aligned and compared with the full S genes of other strains used as reference sequences (Fig. 3) . Thus, no deletions or insertions were observed in the full S genes of the four Cuban BCoV field strains. The deduced amino acid sequences showed a total of 45 amino acid changes compared with the Mebus reference strain and contained 20 potential N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 3) .Several of the amino acid changes found in the Cuban strains were unique, such as: (i) A369T in the strain VB16/10/CIENFU-EGOS/2010, which was located in immuno-reactive domain S1A; (ii) a non-conservative substitution in the hypervariable region, G492D, was found in the strains VB7/09/MAYABEQUE/2009 and VB16/10/CIENFUEGOS/2010; (iii) the replacement I1237T was found in the strains VB24/11/CIEGO DE AVILA/2011 and VB68/ 11/CAMAGUEY/2011; and (iv) the substitution N1285K was observed in all of the Cuban sequences assessed. This substitution was located in the heptad repeat region (HR) (HR-C). However, the proteolytic cleavage site (KRRSRR) of the S protein at residue 768 in subunits S1 and S2 was conserved in all Cuban strains (Fig. 3) .In addition, specific amino acid signatures that have been linked with either respiratory or enteric tropism were found in the Cuban strains (see Fig. 3 ). Seven amino acid signatures that have been suggested to be possible virulence factors (Zhang et al., 1991) were also observed in the Cuban strains. Notably, several of the amino acid changes found were located in regions of functional importance for virus-cell interactions. Thus, residue changes were observed in the signal peptide, the hypervariable region, the immuno-reactive domain S1B and the first hydrophobic region of S2 (Fig. 3) . Conversely, the amino acid replacements E965V, W984L and A988V in the first hydrophobic region of S2 increased the protein hydrophilicity (data not shown).  Discussion  Novel data on the diversity and ecology of BCoV are of interest for the scientific community, not only because this virus is considered an important veterinary pathogen but also because several coronavirus cross-species transmission events, as well as changes in virus tropism, have been described in the recent past (Zhang et al., 2007) .Sequence analyses suggest the potential for zoonotic transmission of a BCoV to humans (Vijgen et al., 2005) , and researchers have previously confirmed the isolation of a bovine-like CoV from a human child with diarrhoea.In the present study, a molecular analysis of Cuban BCoV field sequences from samples collected between 2009 and 2011 was conducted by comparison with all of the BCoV S gene sequences that were available in the GenBank database. In addition, phylogenetic comparisons based on partial or complete S gene sequences used as phylogenetic markers were conducted.The entire or partial BCoV S gene sequences have been widely used for molecular and phylogenetic analyses of this viral agent (Liu et al., 2006; Park et al., 2006) . The phylogenetic noise, investigated by likelihood mapping, revealed that although the analysis (a) Fig. 3 . Molecular analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences for the entire S genes of the Cuban field and reference strains. Regions important for virus-cell interactions were highlighted: the signal peptide region (red), the hypervariable region (orange), the proteolytic cleavage region (pink), the first hydrophobic region of the S2 subunit (grey), the HR-N domain (greenish-blue) and the HR-C domain (dark green). The immuno-reactive domains S1A and S1B were outlined in red and blue, respectively; the transmembrane region was outlined in black. The particular signatures linked either with a respiratory (blue arrow) or enteric (red arrow) tropism and virulence factors (black arrow) were also indicated. The potential N-glycosylation sites were marked with black triangles. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) using the entire S gene yielded a better tree resolution with bettersupported tree topologies, the partial S gene could still be useful as phylogenetic marker; less than 30.0% of the phylogenetic information is lost in comparison with the entire S gene.The high sequence identity shown by the Cuban BCoV strains demonstrates the low divergence between these strains. On the other hand, the results of the phylogenetic analyses were well supported by different phylogenetic inference methods and high confidence values. Thus, all topologies obtained from each phylogenetic marker were reliable. The fact that all the Cuban BCoV strains were located in a single cluster supports the hypothesis that the BCoV strains currently circulating among Cuban bovine herds share a common origin and are closely genetically related (Fig. 2c) .The Cuban BCoV strains clustered with the USA BCoV strains, and this cluster was the only one to contain strains with a non-recombinant origin, indicating an epidemiological link between Cuban and USA BCoVs. Considering the insular condition of the country, the fact that BCoV is only transmitted by direct contact between animals and that the first evidence of BCoV infection in Cuba was obtained in 2004 (Barrera et al., 2006) suggest that a USA BCoV strain(s) is the most likely origin of the Cuban BCoV strains. Alekseev et al. (2008) reported that Coronaviruses from wild ruminants cluster with BCoV strains according to the year of (b) Fig. 3. (continued) isolation/circulation, suggesting an epidemiological link among these strains. Therefore, there may be a connection between Cuban and US BCoV circulating in cattle during these years. However, how the virus was transmitted remains unclear.The multiple amino acid alignment performed showed that the Cuban BCoV strains exhibited particular amino acid signatures that might be linked either with respiratory or enteric tropism. This has been supported by the idea that the respiratory strains could undergo an initial extensive replication in the nasal mucosa and subsequently spread to the gastrointestinal tract through the swallowing of large quantities of virus coated in mucous secretions. This initial respiratory amplification of BCoV and its protective coating by mucus may allow larger amounts of the labile, enveloped, but infectious virus to transit to the gut after swallowing, resulting in intestinal infection and faecal shedding (Saif, 2010) . Moreover, the animals' nostrils could also be contaminated with enteric viruses by direct contact with and inhalation of faeces, allowing the infection of the respiratory tract with enteric strains (Zhang et al., 2007) .The unique Cuban BCoV polymorphism N1285K situated in the heptad repeat region (HR-C) could be involved in changes in the replication of the virus. HR-C is a critical element in the conformational change of the coiled-coil structure that is required for the interaction of the viral and host cell membranes, promoting the fusion of the lipid bilayers and the introduction of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm (Baker, 2008) . Thus, the drastic change of a charged residue to a polar residue in the HR-C could influence the interaction between the coiled-coil structure and the host cell receptor.On the other hand, it has been speculated that mutations in and around the heptad repeats of Coronavirus represent a pathway for virus cross-species transmission (Graham and Baric, 2010) . Nonetheless, the role of the N1285K mutation in viral replication or virus cross-species transmission should be studied further.It is also important to highlight that WD, which is the most severe clinical form of BCoV infection, occurs in adult cattle in the winter due to predisposing events such as cold temperatures and drinking cold water (White et al., 1989) . However, the tropical weather conditions in Cuba are far from ''cold temperatures in the winter season''. Similarly, some WD outbreaks associated with BCoV infections during warmer seasons have been reported (Decaro et al., 2008; Park et al., 2006) . These issues suggest that molecular changes in the currently circulating BCoV strains could have occurred to facilitate viral adaptation to the warmer environment. The molecular analysis of the S entire gene in the present work did not reveal any genetic markers linked to viral adaptation to hot weather. This suggests that the viral adaptation to temperature changes could be linked to others structural or non-structural genes.Finally, the present study highlights the need for more in depth epidemiological and molecular investigations on BCoV infection based on the entire viral genome, to identify genetic markers linked to viral tropism and adaption to a warmer climate, which remain unknown by the scientific community.  		1			1			
21917363	Branched-chain C-cyano pyranonucleosides: Synthesis of 3′-C-cyano & 3′-C-cyano-3′-deoxy pyrimidine pyranonucleosides as novel cytotoxic agents	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115479/	This report describes the total and facile synthesis of 3′-C-cyano & 3′-C-cyano-3′-deoxy pyrimidine pyranonucleosides. Reaction of 3-keto glucoside 1 with sodium cyanide gave the desired precursor 3-C-cyano-1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-α-D-glucofuranose (2). Hydrolysis followed by acetylation led to the 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-acetyl-3-C-cyano-D-glucopyranose (4). Compound 4 was condensed with silylated 5-fluorouracil, uracil, thymine and N(4)-benzoylcytosine, respectively and deacetylated to afford the target 1-(3′-C-cyano-β-D-glucopyranosyl)nucleosides 6a–d. Routine deoxygenation at position 3′ of cyanohydrin 2, followed by hydrolysis and acetylation led to the 3-C-cyano-3-deoxy-1,2,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-D-allopyranose (10). Coupling of sugar 10 with silylated pyrimidines and subsequent deacetylation yielded the target 1-(3′-C-cyano-3′-deoxy-β-D-allopyranosyl)nucleosides 12a–d. The new analogues were evaluated for their antiviral and cytostatic activities. It was found that 6a was endowed with a pronounced anti-proliferative activity that was only 2- to 8-fold less potent than that shown for the parental base 5-fluorouracil. None of the compounds showed activity against a broad panel of DNA and RNA viruses.	Introduction  Modified nucleosides constitute a major class of biologically active compounds, especially as antitumor and antiviral agents [1e4] . Cytotoxic nucleoside analogues were among the first chemotherapeutic agents to be introduced for the medical treatment of cancer [5] . Nucleoside chemistry has also evolved to facilitate efficient routes to effective agents for the treatment of viral diseases caused by HIV [6] and herpes viruses [7] . Subsequently, nucleosides, which are frequently altered in the carbohydrate or base moiety, became the focus for the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents.During the last decades, several branched-chain sugar nucleosides have been extensively studied for their potential antitumor or antiviral properties [8e11] . Attachment of the cyano group to the sugar moiety has been an attractive object for nucleoside chemists due to its small size and its great electron withdrawing character. Thus, cyano ribofuranose nucleosides have been reported as interesting antiviral agents [12e14] , while replacement of the hydroxyl group of 1-b-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) by the cyano group led to a new biologically active compound [15, 16] , with a novel mechanism of anticancer action [17] .Lately, nucleosides bearing pyranosyl rings have been evaluated for their potential antiviral [18e20], antioxidant [21] and antibiotic [22] properties and as building blocks in nucleic acid synthesis [23, 24] . As part of our efforts to develop novel biologically active agents, we recently reported that new classes of uncommon 3 0 -fluorinated pyranonucleosides have a promising potential in combating the rotaviral infections and in the treatment of colon cancer, and are efficient as antitumor growth inhibitors [25e29] . Experimental data also revealed that human poly(A)-specific ribonuclease [30] and glycogen phosphorylase [31] are among the molecular targets of these compounds.In view of the interesting biological activity of the fluorinated pyranonucleosides, we decided to extend our studies to the synthesis of novel molecules in which an electron withdrawing cyano group replaces the fluorine atom. Therefore, we report the stereocontrolled synthesis of novel branched-chain C-cyano pyrimidine pyranonucleosides, i.e. 3 0 -C-cyano-b-D-glucopyranonucleosides and 3 0 -C-cyano-3 0 -deoxy-b-D-allopyranonucleosides, bearing 5-fluorouracil, uracil, thymine and cytosine as heterocyclic bases, in order to assess their biological activity. The chemical synthesis and biological activity of these compounds are presented herein.  Chemistry  3 0 -C-Cyano-b-D-glucopyranonucleosides 6aed were prepared according to the synthetic route outlined in Scheme 1. Treatment of the 1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-a-D-ribo-hexofuranos-3-ulose (1) [32] with sodium cyanide in a two-phase ethylether/H 2 O system, in the presence of sodium bicarbonate, afforded the thermodynamically more stable gluco cyanohydrin epimer 2, in a virtually quantitative yield [33, 34] . The assignment of its configuration was further supported by NOE measurements, as depicted in Fig. 1 . A 5% NOE enhancement of H-2 and a 7% NOE enhancement of H-5 on irradiation of the proton of the free OH group show that these protons are on the same side of the ring system. Hydrolysis of 2 using Amberlite IR 120 (H þ ) resin in methanol followed by acetylation using acetic anhydride (Ac 2 O) in pyridine [32] led to the 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-acetyl-3-C-cyano-Dglucopyranose (4). The protected, 1-(2 0 ,3 0 ,4 0 ,6 0 -tetra-O-acetyl-3 0 -Ccyano-b-D-glucopyranosyl) pyrimidine nucleosides 5aed were obtained upon coupling of the precursor material 4 with silylated 5-fluorouracil, uracil, thymine and N 4 -benzoylcytosine, respectively, in the presence of trimethylsilyl trifluomethane-sulfonate (Me 3 SiOSO 2 CF 3 ), in refluxing acetonitrile [35] . The 1 H NMR spectra obtained for the protected nucleosides 5aed, showed large coupling constants between protons H-1 0 and H-2 0 (J 1 0 ,2 0 ¼ 9.4e9.6 Hz), indicating an axial orientation of both protons and equatorially oriented base rings. Fully deprotection of 5aed, performed by saturated methanolic ammonia [36] , gave the desired nucleosides 6aed.Compound 2 was the starting material for the synthesis of 3 0 -Ccyano-b-D-allopyranonucleosides 12aed (Scheme 1). Phenoxythiocarbonylation of 2 under a commonly used condition, phenyl chlorothionoformate, 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) and triethylamine (Et 3 N) in CH 3 CN [16] , afforded the 3 0 -O-phenoxythiocarbonyl derivative 7, which proved to be unstable during the purification process. Therefore, crude 7 was directly submitted to deoxygenation with Bu 3 SnH in the presence of 2,2 0 -azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN), to give the 3 0 -deoxy derivative sugar 8, in 76% overall yield. In order to elucidate the structure of the newly synthesized 8, NOE measurements were performed, as depicted in Hydrolysis of 8 using Amberlite IR 120 (H þ ) resin in methanol followed by direct standard acetylation led to the 1,2,4,6-tetra-Oacetyl-3-C-cyano-3-deoxy-D-allopyranose (10) . Condensation of cyano sugar 10 with per-O-silylated 5-fluorouracil, uracil, thymine and N 4 -benzoylcytosine using Me 3 SiOSO 2 CF 3 as activator, afforded the 1-(2 0 ,4 0 ,6 0 -tri-O-acetyl-3 0 -C-cyano-3 0 -deoxy-b-D-allopyranosyl) pyrimidine nucleosides 11aed, respectively [35] . 1 H NMR data obtained for the newly synthesized nucleosides 11aed (J 1 0 ,2 0 ¼ 9.4e9.7 Hz, J 2 0 ,3 0 ¼ 5.0e5.2 Hz), revealed the b-configuration of the sugar moiety and an axial oriented cyano group, respectively.Finally, treatment of 11aed with hydrazine hydrate in buffered acetic acid (AcOH)epyridine gave the fully deprotected nucleosides 12aed, in yields that varied from 55% to 75%. Interestingly, attempts to deprotect 11aed by NH 3 /methanol (MeOH) under the subsequent basic conditions produced complex mixtures, containing b-elimination products, probably due to the acidity of H-3 0 and the presence of two leaving groups (OAc) at the 2 0 -and 4 0positions of the sugar moiety.Melting points were recorded in a Mel-Temp apparatus and are uncorrected. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Merck precoated 60F 254 plates. Reactions were monitored by TLC on silica gel, with detection by UV light (254 nm) or by charring with sulfuric acid. Flash column chromatography was performed using silica gel (240e400 mesh, Merck). 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were obtained at room temperature with a Bruker 400 spectrometer at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively, using CDCl 3 and methanold 4 (CD 3 OD) with internal tetramethylsilane (TMS).UVeVis spectra were recorded on a PG T70 UVeVIS spectrometer and mass spectra were obtained with a Micromass Platform LC (ESI-MS). Optical rotations were measured using an Autopol I polarimeter. Infrared spectra were obtained with a Thermo Scientific Nicolet IR100 FT-IR spectrometer. Acetonitrile and toluene were distilled from calcium hydride and stored over 3E molecular sieves.A mixture of 1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-a-D-ribo-hexofuranos-3-ulose (1) (4 g, 15.5 mmol), H 2 O (62 mL), ethylether (124 mL), sodium bicarbonate (2.6 g, 15.5 mmol) and sodium cyanide (0.76 g, 7.75 mmol) was stirred vigorously at room temperature overnight. The organic phase was separated, and the aqueous phase was washed with ethylether (2 x 124 mL). The combined ether phases were dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified by flash chromatography [(ethylacetate) EtOAc/hexane, 3:7)] to give compound 2 (4.28 g, 97%, Rf ¼ 0.40 in EtOAc/hexane, 3:7) as a white solid, mp 98e100 C [34] .   Biological activity  The cytostatic activity of 6aed and 12aed was determined against murine leukemia L1210, human lymphocyte CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cell cultures. The test compounds showed poor, if any cytostatic activity against the three cell lines, except the 3 0 -C-cyano-5-fluorouracil pyranonucleoside 6a that showed pronounced antiproliferative activity against all three cell lines. Its cytostatic activity spectrum was similar to that of the parent base 5-fluorouracil. It is currently unclear whether 6a is biologically active as such, or, alternatively, acts as a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil, from which the free base may be released by the action of phosphorolytic enzymes and/or by a spontaneous release ( Table 1) .None of the compounds was endowed with activity against a broad panel of DNA and RNA viruses in cell culture at 100 mM.  Conclusion  In conclusion, the stereocontrolled synthesis of the 3 0 -C-cyano & 3 0 -C-cyano-3 0 -deoxy pyranonucleoside analogues bearing 5-fluorouracil, uracil, thymine and cytosine, respectively was undertaken. The target nucleosides were tested for their inhibitory effects on the proliferation of murine leukemia L1210, human lymphocyte CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cell cultures. 3 0 -C-Cyano-5-fluorouracil pyranonucleoside 6a showed a similar cytostatic activity spectrum as the free base 5-fluorouracil.

Antiviral and cytostatic assays  The antiviral assays [except anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) assays] were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity in HEL [herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2 (G), vaccinia virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus], Vero (parainfluenza-3, reovirus-1, Coxsackie B4, and Punta Toro virus), HeLa (vesicular stomatitis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, and respiratory syncytial virus), MDCK (influenza A (H1N1; H3N2) and B virus) and CrFK (feline corona virus (FIPV) and feline herpes virus) cell cultures. Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 cell culture inhibitory dose-50 (CCID 50 ) of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) in the presence of varying concentrations (5,000, 1,000, 200 . nM) of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virusinfected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds.The anti-HIV activity and anti-proliferative activity were evaluated against HIV-1 strain IIIB and HIV-2 strain ROD in human T-lymphocyte CEM cell cultures. Briefly, virus stocks were titrated in CEM cells and expressed as the 50% cell culture infective dose (CCID 50 ). CEM cells were suspended in culture medium at w3 Â 10 5 cells/ml and infected with HIV at w100 CCID 50 . Immediately after viral exposure, 100 ml of the cell suspension was placed in each well of a flat-bottomed microtiter tray containing various concentrations of the test compounds. After a 4-day incubation period at 37 C, the giant cell formation was microscopically determined. Compounds were tested in parallel for cytostatic effects in uninfected CEM cells.  					1			
12493490	Natural bovine lentiviral type 1 infection in Holstein dairy cattle. I. Clinical, serological, and pathological observations	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134018/	Abstract Clinical, serological, and pathological abnormalities observed in Holstein cows naturally infected with bovine lentivirus 1 bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) and other infections were progressive and most commonly associated with weight loss, lymphoid system deficiency, and behavioral changes. Clinical evidence of meningoencephalitis was dullness, stupor, and occasional head or nose pressing postures. The polymerase chain reactions associated the BIV provirus with the lesions in the central nervous system and lymphoid tissues. Multiple concurrent infections developed in retrovirally infected cows undergoing normal stresses associated with parturition and lactation. A major functional correlate of the lymphoreticular alterations was the development of multiple secondary infections which failed to resolve after appropriate antibacterial therapy. The chronic disease syndrome in dairy cows associated with BIV may be useful as a model system for investigation of the pathogenesis of the nervous system lesions and lymphoid organ changes that occur in humans with lentiviral infection.	Introduction  In 1969, a Louisiana dairy cow (R-29) was found to be infected with a virus that was identified as a retrovirus. It was subsequently named bovine immunodeficiency virus, also known as bovine lentivirus-1 (BIV) [1 -4] . The cow had persistent lymphocytosis, became severely weak and emaciated following parturition and was euthanized. The lymph nodes (LN) were enlarged; although, evidence of lymphosarcoma was not detected. The LN had generalized hyperplasia and the brain had mild lymphocytic perivascular cuffing [1] . Subsequent experimental infection of cattle with this isolated agent (BIV isolate R-29) produced lesions in the lymphoid system, ranging from lymphocytosis to lymphoid hyperplasia of the LN and hemal lymph nodes (HLN). Studies of BIV were discontinued until the value of investigating the comparative features of this agent with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was recognized [5 -8] .Serological studies in Louisiana have demonstrated substantial prevalence (11%) of BIV infection in dairy cattle [9] . Endemic BIV infection of 48-77% has been documented [10] . During an adverse winter and spring of 1991, more than 30% of the cows in a production herd died or were culled for multiple primary and secondary disease processes [10] . The cows had multiple disease conditions including abscesses (non-responsive to treatment), laminitis and infectious pododermatitis, and mastitis. A cosmopolitan distribution of BIV has been demonstrated by detection of immunologic and molecular methods [3, 4, 11] .Until recently, studies of cattle maintained under non-stressful experimental conditions and inoculated with BIV isolates have demonstrated subclinical effects in lymphoid tissues and relatively minor alterations of in vivo immunological function [3, 12] . Experimental BIV infection of cattle has been associated with immune dysfunction which included a decreased CD4/CD8 ratio with delayed and lower antibody responses to bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and bovine herpesvirus 1 [13] . Viral replication was identified by detection of BIV provirus or by virus isolation in a variety of tissues, including brain [14 -17] . Lymphadenopathy and non-suppurative meningoencephalitis have been identified in calves experimentally infected with BIV strain FL112 isolated from a dairy cow in Florida, USA [18 -21] . Two of six calves inoculated with BIV had clinical ataxia [21] , suggestive of the bovine paraplegic syndrome (BPS) observed in Venezuelan cattle [22] .During a 17 month period, 16 cows were removed from a dairy herd with endemic BIV infection and euthanized due to one or more disease conditions. Efforts were made to: (1) identify all the infectious disease processes and the etiologic agents in each cow, (2) document the presence of BIV provirus in the brain and lymphoid organs, and (3) characterize the lymphoid tissue and brain lesions. This report documents clinical, serological, and pathological observations in Holstein dairy cattle associated with natural infections of bovine lentivirus-1 (BIV).  Animals and analyses  Fifteen adult Holstein cows and one juvenile adult, ages 14 months to 6 years (mean ¼ 2.9 years) were obtained from a dairy herd ðn ¼ 90Þ; with endemic retroviral infection, humanely euthanized and necropsied during a 17 month period ( Table 1 ). The dairy herd was a well managed, producing herd used for teaching and research activities at the Baton Rouge, Louisiana unit of the Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station. Cows were fed a total mixed ration and had rolling herd average milk of 8816 kg (19,395 lb) per year. Veterinary examinations and treatments were provided, as needed, through the Large Animal Clinical Service of the LSU Veterinary Teaching Hospital and Clinics. There were no unusual environmental stresses such as exposure to inclement weather. Clinical disease problems, weights, and body condition scores [23] were recorded, at the time of parturition, before the onset of clinical disease, and at euthanasia (Tables 1 and 2) . Immediately prior to euthanasia, whole blood was collected for hematological and serological analyses. A prompt necropsy was conducted beginning with the collection of the brain and completed for all tissues within 2 h following death.Tissues were submitted to the Louisiana Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory for immunofluorescence examination and/or culture for the following pathogens: BVDV, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV), parainfluenza virus-3 (PI3), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parvovirus (BPV), bovine rotavirus (BRV), bovine coronavirus (BCV), and Chlamydia psittaci. Serum samples were tested for antibody to bovine leukosis virus (BLV) (ELISA kit, IDEXX Herd Chek BLV Antibody Test Kit). Detection of BIV antibody by ELISA was performed as previously described [10] . Bacteriologic cultures were performed on all gross tissue lesions suspected to have a bacterial etiology. Intestine and liver were submitted for Salmonella culture. Colon contents and bile were collected for parasitological examination. Routine sections of all major organs were collected, fixed in 10% zinc formalin, and processed by routine methods for staining and histology.  Detection of BIV in tissues  The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify BIV proviral sequences was completed on DNA recovered from various brain regions and from selected lymphoid organs, using standard methods [24 -27] . The left hemisphere of the brain was sectioned for the collection of regions identified as cerebral cortex, hippocampus, medial geniculate body, brainstem, cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar folia, and medulla oblongata at the level of the cerebellar vermis. Tissues were frozen at 2 20 8C and stored at 2 70 8C for 1 -52 weeks prior to shipment to Mississippi State for BIV-PCR analysis. Brain tissues from 14 of 16 cows, and lymphoid organs from 15 of 16 cows, were tested for the presence of BIV proviral DNA ( Table 3) .Purification of DNA from tissue was accomplished with the Puregene kit (Gentra Systems). The DNA from BIV-R29-infected, and uninfected, fetal bovine lung (FBL) cells was purified by the same method and served as positive and negative controls, respectively. The purified DNA was probed for BIV proviral DNA sequences by targeting a 495 bp region of the reverse transcriptase domain of the BIV pol gene [27] . The positive sense primer sequence was 5 0 ATGCTAATGGATTTTAGGGA3 0 and the negative primer sequence was 5 0 AACGCCATTTCTTGGGTGTG3 0 . The PCR reaction mixture consisted of 0.1 mM of each primer, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , PCR reaction buffer, and 5 -10 mg template DNA. The reaction mixture was heated from 93 to 100 8C for 10 min. The mixture was cooled on ice for 5 min, then 200 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dCTP, dGTP, and 1 ml of 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) was added. The final reaction volume was 100 ml. The reaction mixture was overlaid with mineral oil, then subjected to 33 cycles of the following cycling scheme, using the Delta Cycler II thermocycler (Ericomp): 94 8C for 45 s, 45 8C for 30 s, and 72 8C for 2 min. The PCR reaction products were electrophoresed in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels; the gels were stained with ethidium bromide, and the DNA products were visualized using a UV transilluminator. Tissues that yielded indeterminate PCR reactions had product of inappropriate size, compared to the positive controls.  Clinical observations  Eleven of the 16 cows had between 7.1 and 39.3% weight loss after the onset of clinical problems and the majority had more than one active disease process at the time of euthanasia (Tables 1 and 2 ). Body condition scores fell from a preclinical disease level of 2.5 -3.5 (mean 2.9) to 1.5 -3.5 (mean 2.4). Twelve of 15 postpartum cows were in the first The secondary disease processes, and their incidence included: metritis (12.5%), subcutaneous abscesses (18.75%), purulent arthritis (18.75%), laminitis and infectious pododermatitis (37.5%), distomiasis (50%), and mastitis (56.25%) ( Table 2 ). In addition to weight loss, clinical signs included reduced vitality, torpidity, dullness, and stupor.  Microbiologic and serologic findings  Eleven of 15 cows had positive BIV ELISA reactions, four were negative and the juvenile adult, animal 13, was not tested. Antibody to BLV was demonstrated in 11 of 16 cows; however, three of the BLV negative cows had previously tested positive for BLV, yielding 14 of 16 (87.5%) serologically positive animals ( Table 2 ). Four cows (animals 6, 7, 8, and 9) tested positive by tissue culture for non-cytopathic BVDV (NC-BVDV), although the tissues had initially tested negative using the fluorescent antibody method. Cow 12 yielded cytopathic BVDV (C-BVDV) from the buffy coat cells of a fresh blood sample collected prior to euthanasia. No cow had clinical or morphologic changes diagnostic for acute or chronic BVDV infection. Tests for IBRV, PI3, BRSV, BPV, BRV, and BCV were negative.Tissue from the brain and small intestine of each cow tested negative for C. psittaci using the fluorescent antibody method and cell culture inoculation. Cow 15 aborted 2 months prior to euthanasia and had uterine lymphosarcoma as well as a positive serological response for C. psittaci.Bacteriologic culture of abscesses, mastitic glands, and regional LN yielded the following pathogens (Table 2) : Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, E. coli, Nocardia sp., and Corynebacterium sp. Normal liver tissue from cow 11 yielded a Salmonella sp. although no signs or lesions of salmonellosis were detected histologically.Generalized Demodex folliculorum infestation was present in cow 14. Hepatic distomiasis due to Fasciola hepatica was identified in 8 of 16 cows by the presence of ova in the bile or feces or enlarged fibrotic bile ducts (Table 2) . Occasional cows had low numbers of Trichostrongylid ova in the feces; however, no parasite-induced abomasal or intestinal lesions were observed.  Lesions observed  Thirteen cows had moderate to marked enlargement of the HLN. These were evident as slightly movable subcutaneous nodules, most commonly in the neck and flank. Enlarged HLN were also noted in the sublumbar regions and in association with LN. Morphology of LN varied from hyperplastic to normal to atrophic with changes in architecture which were correlated with immunologic deficiencies [28] . All 16 cows had morphologic evidence of central nervous system (CNS) disease with variable lesion development. Encephalitis with mononuclear cell infiltration was present in 15 of 16 cows. The pituitary of some cows had multifocal and perivascular accumulations of lymphocytes similar to the infiltration pattern observed in the brain.  PCR analysis  Brain tissues from 6 of 14 cows and lymphoid tissues from 5 of 15 cows were positive for BIV provirus using PCR to amplify a region of the BIV pol gene (Table 3 ). Brain tissue of 3 of 14 cows and lymphoid tissue of 1 of 15 cows yielded indeterminate PCR reactions. Only 5 of 16 cows were negative for BIV provirus in all the tissues examined. In the brain tissue, BIV provirus was detected in the medial geniculate body ðn ¼ 3Þ; brainstem ðn ¼ 2Þ; hippocampus ðn ¼ 3Þ; and cerebral cortex ðn ¼ 5Þ (Table 3 ). In the lymphoid tissues, BIV provirus was detected in the thymus ðn ¼ 3Þ; mesenteric LN ðn ¼ 2Þ; prescapular LN ðn ¼ 1Þ; HLN ðn ¼ 2Þ; and spleen ðn ¼ 3Þ (Table 3) . Brainstem ðn ¼ 2Þ; hippocampus, medial geniculate body, spleen, and mesenteric lymph node of three cows yielded indeterminate PCR product. Four of the five PCR negative cows were positive by ELISA for serum BIV antibody, and all five had histologic encephalitis.  Discussion  Detection of BIV provirus in lymphoid and brain tissue was consistent with the endemic occurrence of BIV in the herd. Storage of tissues for prolonged periods (8-12 months) may have resulted in a higher incidence of negative results. The frequent development of concurrent infections in BIV-infected animals, especially those associated with abscesses, mastitis, and laminitis, suggested that persistent BIV infection had a role in reducing functional immune competence. Lentiviral infection of cells of the reticuloendothelial system, such as the follicular dendritic cells (FDC) can interfere with immunological recognition at several levels and may be implicated in the generation of abnormal immunological reactions [29] . In the animals infected with the bovine lentivirus 1, FDC infection and functional alteration of these cells and/or the lymphoid tissue microenvironment [30] may allow the perpetuation of a chronic infection independent of on-going viral effects on the lymphocytes of the immune system. Under some circumstances the presence of parasitic and other antigenic sources has produced an accelerated onset and clinical course of HIV disease and may be a factor for precipitation of the BIV-associated clinical disease [31, 32] . Concurrent endemic BLV and co-infection with BIV may have influenced disease manifestation. In the United States, BLV herd infection rates were 89% for all US dairy operations and 99% for those in the southeast region which included Louisiana [33] .The recovery of four isolates of NC-BVDV and one C-BVDV isolate suggests that BVDV may be a primary or secondary disease agent in BIV-infected cows. The standard of veterinary care for the dairy included calfhood vaccination for BVD using killed BVDV vaccine. A reduced level of antiviral protection may have been related to the BIV infection as a lower antibody titer for BVDV has been demonstrated following experimental BIV infection [13] . There were no mucosal lesions of BVDV recognized in the cows.The failure to associate Chlamydial infection with the lesions suggests two possibilities. The initial reports of Chlamydial-associated sporadic bovine encephalomyelitis (SBE) may have been instances where Chlamydia sp. occurred as a concurrent pathogen and the BIV retroviral infection was not recognized. Another possibility is that the nervous system lesions of SBE and BIV are closely similar or identical at the light microscopic level [34] . Months after completion of this investigation, a cow aborted with a pigeon strain of C. psittaci which was isolated from the placenta and fetus [35] . Several weeks later this cow (which was serologically positive for BIV) died with metritis and brain lesions of non-suppurative lymphocytic encephalitis. At the time of death the cow was negative for Chlamydia antibody [35] , suggestive of anergy, possibly similar to that reported for BIV as a loss of BIV Gag-specific antibody during the course of infection [36] . Another potential explanation for the encephalitis, other than primary lentiviral infection, is activation of latent vaccinal IBRV. The animals; however, had received calfhood vaccinations and no evidence of IBRV infection or recrudescence was found.In most of the cows with debilitation and weight loss, the LN were normal or reduced in size with reduction or absence of follicular hyperplasia. In cows that had weight loss of approximately 40%, the HLN were not enlarged. Muscle wasting, which occurred while the cows had free-choice access to feed, raised the possibility of a central depression in appetite, suggestive of a clinical neurogenic anorexia which was observed in BIV-infected calves [31] . Weight loss is a component of the recognized progressive changes of initial symptomatic disease in humans with AIDS [37, 38] .Localization of BIV provirus in brain and lymphoid tissues was consistent with the observations of others [14] [15] [16] 39] . Torpidity, stupor, dullness and reduced vitality were observed and clinically attributed to the systemic effect of the multiple subcutaneous abscesses and laminitis, but were possibly the result of lentiviral-induced CNS lesions [10, 40] . Longterm multiyear investigations of dairy cows under modern production stresses are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of cellular infection, viral proliferation, and transmission of BIV.  				1	1			
20537553	Validation of the safety of MDCK cells as a substrate for the production of a cell-derived influenza vaccine	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129197/	Cell culture-based production methods may assist in meeting increasing demand for seasonal influenza vaccines and developing production flexibility required for addressing influenza pandemics. MDCK-33016PF cells are used in propagation of a cell-based seasonal influenza vaccine (Optaflu(®)); but, like most continuous cell lines, can grow in immunocompromised mice to produce tumors. It is, therefore, essential that no residual cells remain within the vaccine, that cell lysates or DNA are not oncogenic, and that the cell substrate does not contain oncogenic viruses or oncogenic DNA. Multiple, redundant processes ensure the safety of influenza vaccines produced in MDCK-33016PF cells. The probability of a residual cell being present in a dose of vaccine is approximately 1 in 10(34). Residual MDCK-DNA is ≤10 ng per dose and the ß-propiolactone used to inactivate influenza virus results in reduction of detectable DNA to less than 200 base pairs (bp). Degenerate PCR and specific PCR confirm exclusion of oncogenic viruses. The manufacturing process has been validated for its capacity to remove and inactivate viruses. We conclude that the theoretical risks arising from manufacturing seasonal influenza vaccine using MDCK-33016PF cells are reduced to levels that are effectively zero by the multiple, orthogonal processes used during production.	Introduction  Influenza virus infections are the major cause of respiratory illness and an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly, very young, and those with intercurrent disease [1, 2] . Vaccination remains the principal means of control for seasonal infections and is the core strategy in pandemic influenza virus preparedness. The vast majority of influenza vaccines are produced in embryonated hens' eggs, using decades-old technology, with one egg resulting in approximately one trivalent vaccine dose. While egg produced vaccines have a long history of safety there are issues of bioburden using this production system and a very small proportion of vaccines have an allergic reaction to egg protein [3, 4] . The logistics of egg production require a 6 month lead time before vaccine production can begin. This lengthy lead time results in a manufacturing inflexibility and can result in vaccine shortages as occurred in the 2004e05 influenza season.To provide for the increasing demand for seasonal influenza vaccines and to develop the production flexibility required for addressing an influenza pandemic, the attention of both industry and government has turned to cell based production methods. These production systems have several potential advantages including being permissive for a wider range of strains than eggs [5] , rapid scalability, and a greater antigenic fidelity of the vaccine virus to field strains [6, 7] . Furthermore, the closed nature of cell based manufacturing and the ability to exhaustively test cell banks for contaminating adventitious agents prior to production significantly reduces the risk of microbial contamination.Several criteria are of importance in selecting a cell line for the production of inactivated influenza vaccines. The cell line must be permissive for a wide range of influenza viruses and permit their replication to high titer. The Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line (MDCK) which has been used in public health surveillance programs, because of its sensitivity and productivity for influenza virus detection, fulfils these requirements [8, 9] . The public health requirement for hundreds of millions of doses of influenza vaccine is facilitated by the use of cells selected for suspension growth in large capacity fermentors [10] . Additional selection of the cells for growth in animal origin free (AOF) media excludes a significant potential source for the introduction of viruses, like those that may be present in bovine serum, during the manufacturing process.While MDCK cells provide significant advantages in vaccine production, the safety of vaccines derived from these cells is of paramount importance. MDCK cells were derived in the late 1950s from the kidney of a normal Cocker Spaniel. Similar to many continuous cell lines, MDCK cells display a variable capacity to produce tumors when injected into immunocompromised animals [11e15] . Tumorigenicity is the ability of injected cells to produce tumors consisting of the same cell type in an immunocompromised animal. Oncogenicity is the ability of cellular elements to transform the cells of the injected animal into neoplastic cells that then grow into host animal-derived tumors [16] . The MDCK-33016PF cells used in the manufacture the Novartis cell-based seasonal influenza vaccine Optaflu Ò are tumorigenic in immunocompromised (Nude) mice. It is, therefore, essential to ensure that no residual cells are present within a vaccine, that cell lysates or DNA are not oncogenic, and that procedures are in place to ensure that the cell substrate does not contain oncogenic viruses. Additional steps in the manufacturing process have been introduced to inactivate viruses and to remove or inactivate functional and potentially oncogenic DNA. We report here on the studies conducted and the multiple and redundant processes used to ensure the safety of an MDCK-33016PF cell-derived influenza vaccine with respect to issues of tumorigenicity and oncogenicity.  Analysis of potential oncogenicity of MDCK cell lysates and DNA  Studies with cell lysates and high molecular weight DNA prepared from end-of-production MDCK-33016PF cells were performed in accordance with EC Directive 86/609/EEC and current international guidelines for the testing of novel cell substrates [16] . These studies evaluated the potential oncogenicity of cell-free MDCK cell components (such as chromatin, host cell proteins, etc.) and purified DNA in neonatal nude mice, rats, and hamsters. 14e16 animals per sex per group (<4 days old) were used in each study. Treatment was by subcutaneous injection of 0.1e0.2 mL per animal. Evaluations included mortality and clinical signs, palpation of injection sites, macroscopic examinations (liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs, brain, lymph nodes and site of inoculation), and microscopic evaluation of selected tissues (muscle from the site of inoculation, lungs, and any lesions from all test article-treated animals and one animal per sex from the control groups).In the studies with lysates, the control material was ß-propiolactone (BPL)-treated Tris buffer and test materials were an MDCK cell-free lysate prepared by freeze-thawing and a lysate of BPLtreated MDCK cells. The volumes of cell lysate administered to the animals, 0.2 mL to neonatal rats and hamsters and 0.1 mL to neonatal nude mice due to their small size, were the equivalents of 1 Â10 7 and 5 Â 10 6 cells, respectively. 1 Â10 7 cells is the average number of cells needed to produce a single clinical dose of trivalent vaccine. The number of treated animals that survived to study termination (w150 days) and the incidence of tumors are summarized in Table 1 .Studies were also performed to test the potential oncogenicity of DNA prepared from MDCK-33016PF cells, influenza-infected MDCK-33016PF cells, and influenza-infected BPL-treated MDCK-33016PF cells. Neonatal Nude mice, rats, and hamsters were tested as described above. The control material used in the studies was mouse DNA. The concentration of DNA per 200 mL dose was w70 mg and is approximately equivalent to 1 Â10 7 MDCK-33016PF cells, the average number of cells needed to produce a single clinical dose of trivalent vaccine. The number of treated animals surviving to scheduled necropsy (w150 days) and the incidence of tumors are summarized in Table 2 .Mortality in neonatal mice during the first two weeks following dosing across all groups, including controls was w50%. The deaths were not treatment-related and were attributable to cannibalism by BALB/c dams provoked by interference with the nests for sexing, sorting, and dosing of pups. No tumors occurred in any tissues in any species. These studies demonstrate that the destruction of intact cells by lysis (freeze-thaw cycles or BPL treatment) abrogates the tumorigenic potential of intact MDCK-33016PF cells, and that DNA or lysates prepared from MDCK-33016PF cells are not oncogenic.  Clearance of cells in the manufacturing process  Viable MDCK-33016PF cells are removed by multiple processes. An initial centrifugation step effects the removal of approximately 99% of cells. A subsequent ultracentrifugation step also removes any intact cells that might remain that stage of the manufacturing process. The ultracentrifugation step was not, however, validated for its cell removal effect and, as a result, this step is not included in deriving an overall clearance factor.There are several filtration steps in the manufacturing process, namely, an initial filtration through 0.45 mm filters followed by two filtrations through 0.2 mm filters, and a final sterile filtration through an 0.2 mm filter; these steps have been validated to effect The cell reduction capacities of the chemical compounds that are used to purify, split and inactivate of the influenza virus were investigated. The effects of BPL, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) were studied to formally document the effects of each chemical on inactivation and depletion of cells. The results of these studies, which mimic the manufacturing process, indicate that in a worst-case challenge, BPL and polysorbate-80 are each capable of reducing the number of viable cells at least 10-fold. The cationic detergent, CTAB, had the strongest effect on cells with a complete destruction of cell cultures within 5 min. The extent of depletion of living cells by CTAB was shown to be !4 log 10 . However, the toxic effect of the reagents on cell viability during processing would likely be much higher than observed in the experimental approach, since the retention period of cells with each reagent would be much longer during the processing than in the experimental approach. Considered from this point of view the reduction capacity of the chemical moieties is unquestionably underestimated and a much higher depletion rate is anticipated. Taken together, the chemical solutions used for the processing of the vaccine have the capability to decrease the number of viable MDCK-33016PF cells by more than 6 log 10 . The chromatography steps used in the manufacture of the viral vaccine are also likely to be effective in cell removal. However, as with the ultracentrifugation step, the chromatographic steps have not been specifically validated for cell removal and were therefore not counted in the overall viral clearance factor. The cumulative cell removal potential of the manufacturing process e centrifugations, filtrations, and chemical treatments e when combined, can effect a greater than 41 log 10 reduction in cell number. Assuming that approximately 10 million cells are needed to produce each dose of vaccine, intact cells are removed by the manufacturing process to the point that there will be less than one cell in 10 34 doses of vaccine. For all practical purposes, the probability of an intact MDCK-33016PF cell being in the influenza vaccine is zero.  DNA removal and inactivation by the manufacturing process  The specified DNA content of the final trivalent bulk and of the dose-adjusted final drug product is less than 10 ng/vaccine dose.This value is consistent with WHO guidelines and FDA Draft Guidance for the DNA content of vaccines produced from continuous cell lines. The FDA Draft Guidance does, however, note that for vaccines produced from continuous cell lines that are tumorigenic, additional considerations may apply, such as the requirement to degrade the DNA below certain sizes [16] .In the manufacture of Optaflu Ò , there are several steps that eliminate DNA. These steps include cellulose sulfate ion-exchange chromatography that binds the influenza virus and allows DNA to pass through and a subsequent CTAB precipitation step that, inter alia, precipitates the DNA. The DNA content of the vaccine is monitored throughout the production process by the ThresholdÔ total DNA assay system (MDS Analytical technologies, CA). The average, residual DNA content, from 18 manufacturing runs, with 3 different vaccine strains was 0.7 ng per dose.During the Optaflu Ò manufacture, the viral harvest is inactivated with BPL. BPL is an alkylating agent that reacts, inter alia, with DNA (primarily guanine residues). BPL also reduces DNA size by inducing strand breaks and cross-links DNA with other DNA chains and with proteins. In addition to reducing the size of the DNA, BPL markedly reduces its ability to serve as a template for DNA polymerases [17e19]. It was noted by these later authors that, under specific conditions, BPL treatment abolishes all traces of DNA activity when evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).No DNA greater than 200 base pairs (bps) in length was detected in final monovalent vaccine bulks by capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE). There is, undoubtedly, DNA greater than ca. 200 bps, but the amount is below the level of detection of the CGE method, and there may be some DNA approaching 1000 bps in length, which is sufficient to potentially encode for an oncogenic protein. Therefore, a mathematical (statistical) modeling approach was used to estimate the potential amount of long DNA sequences. Using this approach, the distribution of DNA lengths before BPL treatment was estimated, as was the relative number of breaks induced by the BPL treatment. The distribution of DNA lengths following BPL treatment was then evaluated by a mathematical model similar to that of Bose and Git [20] . The results of this evaluation provide an estimate of the relative amounts of DNA greater than a chosen length, e.g., 500 bps or 1000 bps, that were below the level of detection of the CGE methodology. The model indicated that, for each of the three production runs evaluated, >99.99% of the residual DNA is below 300 bps in length and that the amount of DNA >500 bps approaches zero.  Induction assays for oncogenic viruses and analysis or the presence of latent DNA viruses  To detect oncogenic DNA viruses a two stage process was implemented (Fig. 2) . Stage 1: Treatment of the cells with sodium butyrate and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for 5 days to induce viral DNA amplification and lytic replication. Stage 2: Examination of the cell pellet by transmission electron microscopy and by PCR for adenoviruses and canine papillomaviruses. Furthermore, to detect the presence of unknown herpesviruses or polyomaviruses, degenerate PCRs, capable of detecting a wide range of herpesviruses and polyomaviruses, were undertaken.On day 0 test article MDCK-33016PF cells were seeded at a density of 5 Â 10 4 cells/mL into 60 Â 150 cm 2 flasks, in 50 mL of culture medium (2.5 Â 10 6 cells/flask). On day 1, once the cells had formed a monolayer, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 0.3 mM sodium butyrate plus 20 ng/mL of TPA (30 bottles) or with fresh medium alone to act as a control for the induction step (30 bottles). The levels of inducing agents were determined following preliminary cytotoxicity experiments on MDCK-33016PF cells and are in line with levels shown to induce maximum induction of HHV-8 in BCBL-1 cells [21] . Induced and uninduced test article cells and BCBL-1 cells were monitored throughout the induction period for viability. As a further negative control MDCK cells derived directly from the ATCC stock (ATCC CCL-34) were seeded and treated like the untreated test article cells. Supernatant material and cell pellets were prepared from day 2 and day 5 samples. Total DNA from pellets of 1 Â10 7 cells were extracted using Qiagen DNA extraction kits.BLCB-1 cells harboring latent HHV-8 were used as a positive control for the induction step. BCBL-1 cells were seeded on day 1 into 24 Â 150 cm 2 culture flasks in 50 mL of medium (1 Â10 7 cells flask) in the presence or absence of inducing agents. Preliminary studies had shown that peak induction occurred on day 5 of treatment. Induction was measured by analysis of cells with a specific, validated real-time PCR for HHV-8 genome copy number, normalized against the copy number of a cellular b-actin gene.To exclude the presence of canine papillomaviruses, a specific, validated, real-time PCR was conducted on the cell pellets of the induced and uninduced cells. Test article and control samples were tested in triplicate. The internal positive control consisted samples of negative nucleic acid spiked with a positive sample 10-fold above the detection limit of the assay. Exogenous internal positive controls were included in all PCR master mixes to establish that all negative reactions were truly negative and not due to failed amplification. Negative controls consisted of the appropriate PCR mix to which negative control, human placental DNA was added. Sentinel extraction controls are designed to detect airborne PCR contamination and consisted of all extraction kit reagents processed alongside the test article. For a valid assay each of the triplicate negative controls were required to be negative and each of the positive controls including the internal positive control had to demonstrate amplification of their target sequences.Specific PCRs for canine adenovirus had been conducted on the MCB and found to be negative. In this induction experiment, the interest was in excluding the presence of heterologous, potentially transforming, adenoviruses. A conventional PCR using primers targeted to the capsid hexon gene was employed on the induced and uninduced MDCK-33016PF cells. This PCR detects human adenoviruses Ad1, Ad2, Ad5 and Ad6 but in addition has a broader specificity for non-human adenoviruses [22, 23] . Degenerate PCR assays for herpesviruses and polyomaviruses were conducted, as previously described [24, 25] , on cells from duplicate bottles of induced and uninduced MDCK-33016PF cells and on control MDCK e ATCC CCL-34 cells. DNA samples were quantified using a NanoDrop Ò ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Labtech UK) and 1 mg DNA used per reaction.Samples were analyzed for herpesvirus genomes using primers derived from viral polymerase gene sequences. Two outer PCRs were performed and then 1 ml of reaction products from each of these assays was amplified in each of two semi-nested PCRs as shown in Fig. 3 .Reactions included control or test DNA template, PCR primers (4 mM) and hotstart Taq mastermix kit (Qiagen) in a total volume of 50 ml. Thermal cycling was performed on a GenAmp PCR system 2400 (Applied Biosystems) using the following cycling parameters: 95 C for 15 min followed by 5 cycles of 94 C for 60 s; 44 C for 2 min, 72 C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles as above but with an annealing temperature of 55 C and a final extension at 72 C for 7 min. Reaction products from both the outer and semi-nested reactions were purified using QuickStepÔ 2 PCR purification kits (VH Bio Ltd, UK). Purified PCR products were subjected to capillary electrophoresis on an ABI PRISM Ò 31310 genetic Analyzer and evaluated using GeneScan software (Applied Biosystems). Three positive control samples, HCMV pol plasmid, HHV-6 pol plasmid and EBV positive Raji cell DNA were used at spike levels of 50 000, 5000 and 500 copies. A no template negative control consisting of water was included after every two samples and after the final sample. The MDCK e ATCC CCL-34 was used as a control for nonspecific amplification products. Degenerate PCR for polyomaviruses was conducted similarly using primers derived from sequences of the large T antigen as shown in Fig. 4 . Positive control plasmids containing T-antigen sequences of JCV and BPyV were used at 50 000 and 5000 copies. Negative controls were as described for the degenerate herpesvirus assay. Analysis of the induced BCLB-1 cells indicated a 44-fold increase in HHV-8 sequences in the induced cells compared to the uninduced cells after normalization for the amount of b-actin DNA in the samples. Examination of 200 cell profiles of duplicate treatments of uninduced and induced BCBL-1 cells indicated the presence of herpesvirus virions in 3% and 0.5% of the TPA plus sodium butyrate treated cells whereas, no virions were detected in the untreated BCBL-1 cells or in the duplicate samples of induced and uninduced MDCK-33016PF cells. For the PCR reactions all the controls met the appropriate validity criteria. The real time CCR for canine oral papillomavirus and canine papillomaviruses 1 and 2 were negative down to the limit of detection (LOD) of 10 2 copies per reaction, equivalent to 1 copy in 1 Â10 5 cells. Similarly the conventional PCR for adenoviruses was negative to the same LOD. In the degenerate PCR for herpesviruses all the positive controls were clearly positive in the semi-nested analysis at 500 copies per reaction. In addition EBV sequences were detectable with primer set 6 and HHV-6 sequences were detectable with primer set 5; emphasizing that some mismatches in the primer sequences are tolerated within these conserved regions of the viral genomes. The induced and uninduced test article MDCK-33016PF cells and the control MDCK cells did not give rise to amplified fragments in the expected size range of herpesvirus products. For the polyomavirus degenerate PCRs the positive controls had the expected specificities and all controls gave positive results at the 5000 copy level. No amplified products of the expected size for a polyomavirus were detected in the induced or uninduced test article cells or the control MDCK cells.  Analysis for the presence of retroviruses  All vertebrate cells contain defective or non-defective retroviral sequences which may be expressed as mRNA. In the cells of some species, virions are spontaneously produced or may be induced to do so after treatment with agents including mutagens like 5-iodo-2 0 -deoxyuridine (IdU) or 5-azacytidine (AzaC), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases [26] . The capacity of MDCK-33016PF cells to produce retroviruses was evaluated by combined treatment with these agents followed by detection of viruses using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and a highly sensitive F-PERT assay for reverse transcriptase [27] . In addition, induced cells were co-cultivated with cells permissive for a wide range of retroviruses to amplify potentially low levels of virus.Duplicate 150 cm 2 flasks were seeded with 1 Â10 6 MDCK-33016PF test article cells on day 0. On day one the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 2 mg/mL AzaC and 30 mg/mL IDU. Similar MDCK-33016PF cultures were established without inducing agents to evaluate the toxicity of the inducing drugs. Duplicate cultures of human 293 HEK cells (ATCC CRL-1573) infected with feline leukemia virus were used as positive controls and duplicate cultures of murine K-Balb cells (ATCC CCL163.3) acted as a positive control for the induction of retrovirus expression. On day two, 24 h after treatment with the inducing agent, the medium was removed from test and control cultures, and the cells re-fed with medium without inducing agent.On days 3, 4 and 5 (1, 2 and 3 days after removing the inducing agent), the supernatants were harvested for analysis by PERT, and fresh medium added. The PERT assays were conduced as previously described using a real-time PCR to detect cDNAs reverse transcribed from a plant virus target [27] . On day 5, cells from the induced and uninduced test article MDCK-33016PF cells were prepared for TEM by fixation in glutaraldehyde and paraformaldehyde in a cacodylate buffer. The cells were then post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h, stained en bloc with uranyl acetate, rinsed, dehydrated in an ethanol series and embedded in Araldite. On day three, 3.3 Â 10 5 cells removed from induced test article MDCK-33016PF cells were co-cultivated in the presence of 2 mg/mL of polybrene with 1 Â10 6 human HEK 293 cells or with control MDCK cells (ATCC CCL-34). The co-cultivations were maintained for 42 days and cells were passaged at least once a week. Test article cells were also passaged without indicator cells to test for any residual reverse transcriptase activity. As a further control, indicator cells were grown and passaged without test article cells to evaluate background reverse transcriptase activity. As a positive control, HEK 293 cells were infected with 100 infectious units of Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) then cultured and passaged in the same way as the test article co-cultures. At least 200 median profiles (i.e. those where a nuclear profile is visible) of the induced and uninduced MDCK cells were examined. Observation of the membrane for budding virions and the cytoplasm for intracellular virions was undertaken but no retroviruses or, other adventitious agents were detected.  Quantitative virus safety risk assessments  In order to quantitatively assess potential risks represented by adventitious viruses, data were collected about growth properties of various relevant viruses in MDCK-33016PF cells, about the virus inactivating and virus clearance of the vaccine manufacturing process, and about the detection limits of applied PCR methods to detect adventitious viruses.Virus growth was studied by inoculating representative viruses into MDCK-33016PF suspension cells followed by extended cultivation in the production medium. The DNA viruses studied were Parvovirus (Minute virus of mice), circovirus (porcine circovirus), polyomaviruses (SV-40, BK virus, avian polyomavirus), herpesviruses (herpes simplex virus, human cytomegalovirus, EpsteineBarr virus), and adenoviruses (human adenoviruses type 1, 5 and 6). The RNA viruses studied were reoviruses (mammalian reovirus 3, two avian reovirus strains), enteroviruses (echovirus, Coxsackie A and B virus), rhinoviruses (rhinovirus 1B, 37, Neth.8501841), coronavirus (229E), paramyxoviruses (parainfluenza 3, two human metapneumoviruses, two human respiratory syncytial viruses), Rous sarcoma virus and avian birnavirus.At least 10 4 infectious units of virus were inoculated into 100 mL suspension cultures with 10 6 cells/mL. The cultures were kept in spinner flasks and were incubated at 33 C for 14 days. Samples of cells and medium were taken directly after inoculation and at intervals thereafter (day 3, 5, 7, 10, 14) to monitor growth of the inoculated agent. By each sampling about 20% of the culture volume and cells were removed and the volume was replaced by fresh medium to maintain a growing culture. The culture samples, including cells, were frozen without separation or removal of cells. At the end of the studies, all samples, including inoculum virus samples were titered together on the same day.Essentially the same viruses and agents that were used for growth studies were also used to assess the capacity of the BPL inactivation process. Inactivation was studied with maximum impurities present, i.e. with unpurified harvests, applying 0.05% BPL and incubating the inactivation at the shortest specified inactivation time periods. Standard micro titer plate virus titrations were used to measure starting tires and end titers after inactivation. If end titers were expected to be significantly below the detection limit of microtitrations ( 1.5 log 10 TCID50/mL), larger volumes (up to 10 mL undiluted sample) were inoculated in culture flasks to test for residual virus at lower detection limits. Starting and end titers were compared and used to calculate the log reduction for each virus.Selected model viruses were used to study virus inactivation and or removal by selected purification process steps. Infectious virus was spiked into process material before the process step, passed through the respective purification procedure at small scale, and samples after the process step were titered in comparison with the spiked starting material. When necessary, cytotoxic samples were diluted before testing. Residual virus below the detection limit of standard microtitration tests was assayed by plating larger volumes. Two enveloped viruses (herpes simplex virus and murine leukemia virus) and three non-enveloped viruses (reovirus3, simian virus 40, and porcine parvovirus) were used for virus removal studies. Study conditions reflected worst-case conditions such as lowest expected detergent concentrations used to detach surface antigens or shortest processing times during separation steps. These validation studies (altogether 14 studies with 5 model viruses) were conducted in collaboration with Analysis GmbH, now part of Newlab BioQuality AG, Erkrath, Germany.Combining all data on the virus growth in MDCK-33016PF cells, on the inactivation or process removal of various model viruses, and with consideration of applicable detection limits for virus exclusion tests, a process-specific risk assessment was made using quantitative data relative to infectious doses. The methodology of these quantitative risk assessments has been described elsewhere [28] . It should be noted that further virus removal studies and robustness studies were done after publication, thus results presented here partly vary from those published earlier (Table 3) .Realistic worst-case assumptions were made to adequately cover variables, such as potential contaminating virus titers, virus passage numbers, dilutions, or inactivation results with different types of the same virus family. Starting with a co-isolated contaminant during isolation of an influenza virus strain from a human throat sample plus further contamination by avian viruses assumed to occur during egg-passage, the virus titers were estimated for all subsequent steps of the vaccine strain selection and passaging to the working seed for vaccine manufacturing. At this level a further contamination by aerosol or droplet infection from the human operator was assumed for all human viruses. The calculation was then continued through the entire manufacturing process, including fermentation, purification, and formulation of a final, trivalent vaccine. Considering also the results obtained during worst-case robustness studies, the end results of the risk assessments in terms of human infectious doses per vaccine dose, were between 10 À7.1 (avian polyomavirus) and 10 À14.9 (respiratory syncytial virus). The according end result for influenza virus would be 10 À16 (Table 3) .  Discussion  Multiple, independent, tests and processes, implemented under GMP ensure the safety of Optaflu Ò with regard to tumorigenic and oncogenic risks. The theoretical risk associated with tumorigenicity relates to the possibility of inoculation of a viable MDCK-33016PF cell into a recipient of the vaccine followed by the growth of that cell in the recipient. The risk of this occurrence is, for all practical purposes, zero. MDCK-33016PF cells are partly killed during the replication of influenza virus and multiple specific steps in the manufacturing process remove or inactivate remaining cells. These processes include centrifugation, filtration, chemical inactivation and membrane disruption (viral splitting). The filtration steps, BPL virus inactivating stages, and viral splitting activities have been specifically investigated to determine their ability to remove or inactivate cells and each operates through orthogonal mechanisms. Collectively, the evaluated steps have the capacity to reduce cellular concentration by !41 log 10 (validated data !35.6 log 10 ). Given that up to approximately 10 million cells are required to produce one dose of vaccine, the risk of an MDCK-33016PF cell being in one vial is less than w10 À34 .In any continuous cell line e indeed, any cell substrate e the possibility that a latent oncogenic virus might be present needs detailed consideration. In the case of DNA viruses, certain members of the herpesvirus, polyomavirus and papillomavirus families can induce tumors in their hosts and other species, while some adenoviruses have been shown to be oncogenic in heterologous hosts. Viruses from these families may also establish latent infections or, become integrated into chromosomal DNA following abortive replication. In addition, viruses might be introduced into the cells from the virus seed, through human contamination or via raw materials. These viral risks were countered by two independent approaches. First a rigorous analysis of the MDCK-33016PF cells was undertaken to exclude the presence of infectious oncogenic viruses or infectious oncogenic viral genomes; secondly the manufacturing process was shown to be capable of inactivating potential virus contaminants at very high levels.Neonatal animals are highly susceptible to the presence of oncogenic viruses [29] but no tumors were induced in neonatal nude mice, rats or hamsters by cell lysates or high molecular weight DNA extracted from MDCK-33016PF cells, therefore, neither infectious virions nor infectious genomes capable of inducing tumors were present. A more definitive analysis for the presence of oncogenic DNA viruses is provided by degenerate PCR capable of broad detection of herpesviruses and polyomaviruses. These methods have been shown to be capable of detecting new viruses [24] emphasizing their utility in this role. The possibility of detecting oncogenic herpesviruses is enhanced by induction procedures that can result in genome amplification and recrudescence from latency. None of the assays involving, degenerate PCRs for herpesviruses and polyomaviruses, broad PCR for adenoviruses and the specific PCRs for papillomaviruses, revealed the presence of oncogenic DNA virus sequences.Dogs are not known to be infected by an exogenous retrovirus nor known to possess proviruses encoding an infective endogenous retrovirus. Although claims for canine retroviruses have been made from time to time, none have been independently confirmed. In some species, infectious, endogenous, retroviruses may be expressed after induction with mutagens or inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases. Since these experiments were conducted, Khan and colleagues have formulated a specific algorithmic approach for the exclusion of retroviruses in vaccine cell substrates [30] ; the studies conducted here are in accord with that approach. The PERT assay for retroviruses is a highly sensitive method for the detection of this family of viruses and does not rely on specific genome information. No retrovirus production was detected following induction or, after co-culture with cells known to be permissive for a range of retroviruses.Our growth studies, as well as systematic literature studies, have shown that MDCK cells only support the growth of a very limited spectrum of viruses (herpes simplex virus , parainfluenza virus, and reovirus), which is almost identical to those viruses that grow in embryonated eggs. In contrast to eggs, however, MDCK cells do not support growth of avian viruses. Compared to existing egg-derived vaccines, the MDCK cells used to produce vaccine virus from influenza virus strains isolated in eggs do not introduce new or higher virus-associated risk, as the host spectrum of MDCK cells is similar to that of embryonated eggs. Using a simple risk scoring algorithm to estimate and compare the risks of adventitious agents when different cell substrates are used for virus isolation and vaccine manufacturing, MDCK cells used to produce vaccines from egg-derived isolates gave either the same or lower risk scores than embryonated eggs used for isolation and production [31] .Modern virus production methods as described here have more in common with recombinant protein or, monoclonal antibody, production than with traditional vaccine manufacturing. The downstream manufacturing steps have the capacity to remove and inactivate viruses particularly through the action of BPL. Processspecific and quantitative risk assessments were made for a wide range of potential process contaminants including latent or oncogenic viruses, such as polyomaviruses, adenoviruses, retroviruses, herpesviruses, and parvoviruses. These model calculations showed that even under worst-case conditions and in the unlikely case of a contamination, the process is able to reduce such contaminants to levels which are million-fold below infectious levels. Even if the calculated worst case contaminant levels are considered, the final vaccine product would still be unable to transmit infectious viruses.Although there are several theoretical ways in which exogenous DNA could contribute to oncogenesis, including insertional inactivation of tumor suppressor genes or transcription of regulatory microRNAs [32] , the principal risk relates to dominant oncogenes. For an oncogene to result in transformation it would have to be present as a full-length copy, be transfected into recipient cells and become integrated in a chromosomal region favorable for expression. Burns reported in 1991 that DNA could be directly oncogenic in experiments using high levels of plasmid containing the activated HRAS gene [33] . More recently, scientists at the FDA have made important contributions by demonstrating the quantitative limits to direct DNA oncogenicity [34, 35] . In their initial studies, 12.5 mg of a plasmid capable of expressing both ras and myc were required to induce tumors in mice [35] . More recently, they have lowered this oncogenic level for a dual oncogene plasmid to 1 ng [36] . These recent data have reduced the safety margin estimate for 10 ng of high molecular weight DNA but methods to reduce the size or functional activity of DNA, like BPL treatment, can increase the safety factor (i.e. inverse of risk) by 10 7 [36] .The conclusions on safety margins are based on intact high molecular weight DNA, but the treatment with BPL radically reduces the functional size of DNA. It should be noted that, even if sequences >1000 bps were present, relatively few 1000-mers will encompass the correct sequence for encoding an oncogene. Our methodology did not enable us to differentiate fragments with still intact structure and BPL-crosslinked and otherwise impaired DNA fragments. However, the residual DNA does not approach that size.Of the maximum amount of 10 ng per dose of DNA present in Optaflu Ò , less than 0.01% is calculated to be above 300 bps, i.e. less than 1 pg, with an even lower percentage above 500 bps.The use of cell based vaccines has the potential to transform the strategies for prophylaxis of seasonal and pandemic influenza, but demonstrating the safety of these vaccines is an essential prerequisite. We conclude that the multiple, orthogonal processes used during production that the theoretical risks arising from manufacturing Optaflu Ò using MDCK-33016PF cells are reduced to levels that are effectively zero.  					1		1	
18468699	Loop-mediated isothermal amplification establishment for detection of pseudorabies virus	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112783/	Abstract A rapid, convenient and reliable pseudorabies virus (PRV) detection system was developed by using the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method. Six special primers were designed successfully based on the PRV DNA-binding protein (DBP) gene. The assay was optimized to amplify PRV DNA by incubation at 63°C for 1h. The LAMP products had a ladder-like pattern of bands from 188bp when electrophoresed on an agarose gel and its specificity was confirmed by digestion with Hinc II enzyme. Two naked-eye detection methods were developed for use in the field. The detection limit of the LAMP assay was found to be 10fg DNA sample which was 100–1000-fold higher than that of PCR. By using DNA (or cDNA) samples extracted from three different PRV strains and six other viruses known to be related genetically to PRV or to cause similar clinical signals in pig, the system was identified to amplify only the PRV DNA. A comparison between the LAMP and PCR assay using five clinical samples showed good correlation.	Introduction  Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a member of the herpesviridae family, which infects pigs with high mortality. This virus disease causes serious reduction to the pig industry and leads to severe financial loss, which requires a better detection system for improving the virus surveillance (Pejsak and Truszczyński, 2006) . Traditionally, PRV detection is based on direct virus isolation (Pensaert and Kluge, 1989) or detection of antigens by an immunohistological method (Ducatelle et al., 1982) . However, both methods are time-consuming, requiring at least 2-3 days. PCR has allowed detection of the virus rapidly, but requiring precise instruments and an elaborate method for detection the amplified product (Osorio, 1991; Balasch et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2007) .Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a nucleic acid amplification method, which amplifies DNA with high specificity, sensitivity and rapidity under isothermal condition using a set of six specially designed primers and a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity (Notomi et al., 2000) . It has been used widely for infectious diseases diagnosis, such as detection of H5N1 avian influenza virus (Imai et al., 2007) , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Hong et al., 2004) al., 2005), foot-and-mouth disease virus (Dukes et al., 2006) , Taura syndrome virus (Kiatpathomchai et al., 2007) and swine vesicular disease virus (Blomström et al., 2007) . In this study, LAMP was applied in PRV detection and its specificity and sensitivity were assessed.  Samples  PRV (strain Fa) was obtained from China Institute of Veterinary Drug Control (CIVDC); PRV (strain SA215, Bartha), porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), swine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) and swine fever virus (SFV) were all derived from their passage in cell culture which were provided by Shanghai Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau (SHCIQ) ( Table 1 ). The clinical samples of porcine brain tissue were collected from suspect cases of pseudorabies.  DNA extraction  Total genomic DNA was extracted using the QlAamp ® DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Germany). After elution in 20 l nucleasefree H 2 O, DNA samples were stored at −70 • C until used.   LAMP primers designing  The DNA-binding protein (DBP) gene (GenBank Accession number U80909) was chosen as the suitable target for designing the LAMP primers, as it provides a relatively conserved nucleic acid fragment of 188 bp. Primers were designed using Primer Explorer V3 software (http://primerexplorer.jp/e/).  LAMP-based detection  The basic LAMP reaction was carried out in a volume of 25 l containing 1× ThermoPol buffer (New England Biolabs Inc., USA), 6.0 mM MgSO 4 , 1.0 M betaine (Sigma, Germany), 1.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 M each of outer primer, 1.6 M each of inner primer and 0.4 M each of loop primer, 8 U of Bst polymerase (Large Fragment; New England Biolabs Inc., USA) with 1 l total DNA as template. The amplification was performed at 65 • C in a laboratory water bath (Kangle, China, 25-99 • C, ±0.3 • C) for 1 h. Initial experiments were performed to optimize the assay by varying the concentration of MgSO 4 , dNTPs, primers, amplification temperature and reaction time.The amplified products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE buffer with the voltage of 120 V for 1 h and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The result could also be visualized directly with the naked eye according to the white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate generated in the reaction or the green color produced by the intercalating dye Picogreen ® (Invitrogen, USA). To confirm the specificity of amplification products, 2 l of the reaction mixture was digested with Hinc II at 37 • C for 4 h.   Sensitivity and specificity of LAMP for PRV detection  The sensitivity of LAMP was demonstrated and compared with PCR (Balasch et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2007) using various PRV DNA dilutions (10 −1 to 10 −9 ) as templates (original concentration of DNA sample was 10 ng/l).The specificity of LAMP was examined by the use of DNA (or cDNA) extracted from three different PRV strains and six other viruses known to be related genetically to PRV or to cause similar clinical signals in pig.  Evaluation of the LAMP assay using clinical samples  The evaluation of the LAMP assay was carried out using DNA extracted from clinical samples with PCR running in parallel.The evaluation of the LAMP assay was carried out using DNA extracted from five clinical samples with PCR running in parallel. The results of LAMP assay correlated well with the PCR, meanwhile, sample 2 was positive by LMAP, but not amplified by PCR (Table 3) .   Designing the LAMP primers  LAMP primers were designed using the Primer Explorer V3 software based on a conserved fragment of the DBP gene (Fig. 1) . After screening according to the end stability of the primers (the free energy of the 3 ends of F2/B2, F3/B3, LF/LB and the 5 -end of F1c/B1c should be −4 kcal/mol or less), one set of primers was chosen ( Table 2 ). The outer primers (F3 and B3) help to displace the primary strand. The inner primers (FIP and BIP) each have two distinct sequences corresponding to the sense and anti-sense sequence of the target. FIP comprises F1c and F2 while BIP comprises B1c and B2. The forward loop primer (LF) is designed using the complementary strand corresponding to the region between F1 and F2 while reverse loop primer (LB) was designed using the complementary strand corresponding to the region between B1 and B2.  Optimizing LAMP assay conditions for PRV detection  The LAMP reaction conditions were optimized by varying the concentration of MgSO 4 , dNTPs, primers, amplification temperature and reaction time. The results indicated that the reaction could be carried out when the Mg 2+ concentration is higher than 4 mM and the optimal amplification was got at 8 mM ( Fig. 2(A) ). As shown in Fig. 2(B) , the ladder-like bands could be obtained with dNTPs ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 mM while 1.0 mM is the best. Fig. 2 (C) demonstrates that the target gene was amplified in the primer ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:10 while the ratio at 1:8 gave the best amplification. As shown in Fig. 2(D and E) , the amplification could be detected initially at 0.5 h and reached maximal at 1 h while the most clear pattern could be obtained at 63 • C.On the basis of the above results, the LAMP assay conditions were optimized in a 25 l reaction volume as follows: 1× Ther-moPol buffer, 8.0 mM MgSO 4 , 1.0 M betaine, 1.0 mM dNTPs, 0.2 M each of outer primer, 1.6 M each of inner primer and 0.4 M each of loop primer, 8 U of Bst polymerase with 1 l total DNA as template. The amplification was carried out at 63 • C for 1 h.  Interpretation of the LAMP products  Amplification products of LAMP were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and visual inspection. As shown in Fig. 3(A) , the target DNA sequence was amplified at 63 • C with a ladder-like pattern on the gel. The positive reaction was also indicated clearly by the white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate in Fig. 3(B) and the green color produced by the intercalating dye Picogreen ® shown in Fig. 3(C) . The specificity of the amplification product was confirmed by Hinc II digestion as indicated in Fig. 3(A, lane 2) . Products of pre-dictable sizes of the 80 and 108-bp motifs were resolved on the gel.  Sensitivity of LAMP for PRV detection  The sensitivity of LAMP was demonstrated and compared with PCR tests by using various PRV DNA dilutions (10 −1 to 10 −9 ) as templates. As shown in Fig. 4 , LAMP was able to detect template at 10 −6 dilution (about 10 fg DNA), whereas PCR could only amplify the 10 −3 to 10 −4 dilution DNA sample. Therefore, the detection sensitivity of LAMP was 100-1000-fold higher than the PCR. Chen et al. (2002) , Balasch et al. (1998) and Lee et al. (2007) , respectively. 1-9, DNA sample located at 10 −1 , 10 −2 , . . ., 10 −9 dilutions, respectively; 10, negative control.   Specificity of LAMP for PRV detection  Three different PRV strains and six other viruses were investigated to confirm the specificity of the LAMP for PRV detection. The results showed that only the PRV is amplified while no amplification is performed in all other tested viruses (Fig. 5) .  Discussion  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of LAMP applied successfully to establish the PRV detection system. Initial experiments were performed to optimize the assay conditions by using different concentration of MgSO 4 , dNTPs, primers, amplification temperature and reaction time. Among all factors analyzed, Mg 2+ had the greatest affect on LAMP; it is possible that Mg 2+ affects DNA polymerase activity and primer annealing (Saiki et al., 1998 ). The LAMP system developed in this study worked well during 60-65 • C, which would be useful for PRV detection in field practice when using a regular laboratory water bath. The results demonstrated that LAMP amplification products could be detected in 0.5 h, faster than PCR, so that diagnosis, including DNA extraction, amplification and product detection could be completed within 1 h after arrival of the samples. It could make the technique far more suitable for practice in the field.It was observed that a large amount of pyrophosphate ion was produced when nucleic acid was amplified by LAMP, yielding white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate in the reaction mixture which allowed naked-eye detection (Mori et al., 2001) . Alternatively, LAMP products could also be detected by adding intercalating dye Picogreen ® . Positive amplification exhibited a green color while a negative reaction corresponded to an orange color (Dukes et al., 2006) . The two visual inspection of LAMP product (Fig. 3(B and C) ) are better detection methods as there is no need for gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide. Furthermore, it was found that all samples which tested positive/negative by visual inspection were also positive/negative when analyzed by electrophoresis. It may facilitate the application of LAMP, especially as a field test.As a test for virus, the sensitivity is essential in cases where low concentration of virus is expected. The detection limit of the LAMP system established was about 10 fg DNA, much more sensitive than the PCR for PRV detection. Six other viruses were used in the study to confirm the specificity of LAMP; the results showed no DNA amplification in all viruses used, which makes LAMP more attractive for PRV detection in the field. The high specificity of LAMP is most probably attributable to recognition of the target sequence by six independent sequences in the initial stage and by four independent sequences during the second reaction stage (Notomi et al., 2000) . A good correlation was obtained between the LAMP and PCR results when using five clinical samples collected from suspect cases of pseudorabies, which demonstrated the value in practice of LAMP. The LAMP assay could detect all the samples shown positive by PCR as well as sample 2.  				1	1			
12711056	Recombinant M protein-based ELISA test for detection of antibodies to canine coronavirus	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119567/	Abstract The membrane (M) protein of canine coronavirus (CCoV) was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The purified recombinant protein was then evaluated for its antigenicity and reliability in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of CCoV antibodies in dog sera. Fifty serum samples, screened previously by whole virus ELISA and Western blotting, were tested. When the performance of the new test was compared with those of whole virus ELISA and Western blotting, an excellent correlation was found with the latter two assays. The ELISA based on recombinant M protein represents an alternative and valid test for detection of antibodies to CCoV in dog sera.	Introduction  Canine coronavirus (CCoV) belongs to one of the major antigenic group of coronaviruses (Siddell et al., 1983; Spaan et al., 1988) and is related closely to transmissible gastroenteritis virus of pigs, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, feline coronaviruses and human coronavirus 229E (Sanchez et al., 1990; Horsburgh et al., 1992; Wesseling et al., 1994) . CCoV may cause sporadic outbreaks of vomiting and diarrhoeal disease in dogs and the feces are the primary source of infection. CCoV infection is usually asymptomatic and disease signs vary greatly, but they occur most commonly in young pups (Carmichael and Binn, 1981) .The coronavirus genome consists of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA molecule that is 20Á/30 kb in size (Murphy, 1996; Siddell, 1995) . Virions are enveloped, pleomorphic, 80 Á/220 nm in diameter and they have club-shaped peplomers. According to the generally accepted model of coronavirus structure, viral genomic RNA is complexed with a phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein, N protein, in a helical configuration. The surrounding envelope contains three viral proteins. The trimeric spike (S) protein, the major inducer of virus-neutralizing antibodies (Gebauer et al., 1991) , forms characteristic viral peplomers which are involved in virus attachment on the cell receptors and in virus cell fusion (de Hann et al., 2000) . The small membrane protein (E), recognized recently as a structural component of the coronavirus, has been found to be important for assembly of the viral envelope (Raamsman et al., 2000) . The membrane (M) glycoprotein is the most abundant structural protein; it spans the membrane bilayer three times, leaving a short NH 2 -terminal domain outside the virus and a long COOH terminus inside the virion (Rottier, 1995) . The M protein induces antibody-dependent complement-mediated virus neutralization (Woods et al., 1987) . Although its function is not completely clear, M seems to play a key role in virus assembly and budding.In this report, cloning and expression of the recombinant M protein (rMP) of CCoV in E. coli system and its use in an ELISA to detect CCoV antibodies are described.  Construction of the expression plasmid  The coding region for the M protein was amplified by 30 cycles of PCR using 10 ng of random-primed reversetranscribed RNA isolated from a CCoV strain of a dog with enteritis (Buonavoglia et al., 1994) . The sequences of the primers employed in the PCR reaction were 5?-TTCGGATCCAAGATTTTGTTAATACTAGC-3? (forward primer) and 5?-ACCAAGCTTTTATAC-CATGTGTAATAATTTTTCT-3? (reverse primer), which carried a BamHI and an HindIII restriction site, respectively. The amplified products, 0.8 kb in length, were gel purified and cloned into the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen), and the constructs transformed into E. coli TOP10F cells (Invitrogen). Transformants selected on 2 )/TY plates containing ampicillin (100 mg/ml) were screened by direct colony PCR, and by restriction digestion of purified plasmids. The sequence of inserts was verified. The sequence data obtained were compared with the sequence of the M gene of CCoV strain Insavc (accession number D13096). The alignment performed by CUSTAL W software revealed more than 90% of nucleotide identity between the two sequences.The encoded protein had an additional N-terminal tail of arg Á/gly Á/ser Á/his Á/his Á/his Á/his Á/his encoded by the expression vector followed by a glycine and serine residue encoded by the BamHI restriction site sequence.  Expression and purification of the recombinant protein  The expression of M protein in the bacterial cytosol was accomplished in E. coli M15[pREP4] (Qiagen). A colony of cells of E. coli M15[pREP4] transformed recently was inoculated into 1 l of 2)/TY in presence of ampicillin, at 100 mg/ml and kanamycin, at 25 mg/ml, and culture was grown at 30 8C until the optical density of the culture at 600 nm reached 1.2. Then isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 1.5 mM to induce the expression of rMP, and the incubation was continued for further 8 h. Control cultures containing the empty pQE30 vector were processed in parallel. The rMP accumulated in the bacteria as inclusion bodies. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and used for the preparation of inclusion bodies (Fiermonte et al., 1993) . Cells from a liter of culture were resuspended in 20 ml of a buffer containing Hepes-NaOH 10 mM and 50 mM NaCl, pH 7, disrupted in a French press and centrifuged at 4 8C at 27 000)/g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and fractionated by centrifugation at 131 000)/g for 4.5 h at 4 8C through a step gradient, 10 ml of 40%, 15 ml of 53% and 4 ml of 72% (w/v) solutions of sucrose dissolved in the buffer. The inclusion bodies gathered as a grey band at the interface between the 53 and 72% layers. They were recovered and washed with 20 ml of buffer containing 3% of Triton-X114 and centrifuged at 27 000)/g for 15 min at 4 8C. The pellet was resuspended in a further 2 ml of buffer without detergent. Inclusion bodies, membrane fractions and samples taken from cultures at various point of growth were examined by PAGE in the presence of SDS on 17.5% gels (Laemmli, 1970) . The proteins either were stained with Coomassie Blue dye or were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF Immobilon P, pore size 0.45 mm) to determine the Nterminal sequence of the recombinant M protein. To eliminate few bacterial contaminants present in the inclusion bodies, the rMP was gel purified by electroelution.  Dog sera  Fifty canine serum samples were used in this study. The serum samples had been already determined to be as either positive (n.34) or negative (n.16) to CCoV antibodies by routine ELISA and Western blotting .  Western blotting  The immunoblotting was carried out as described previously . Briefly, purified rMP was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 8C using a 5% solution of non-fat dry milk (NFDM) (Blotting Grade Blocker, Biorad), then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a monoclonal antibody directed against CCoV M protein and with both a CCoV positive and a CCoV negative dog serum. After washing in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS; Tris 25 mM, NaCl 200 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-TM), the membranes were incubated with peroxidase labeled goat anti-mouse IgG and with peroxidase labeled goat anti dog IgG. 3,3?-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB, Sigma) was used to visualize the reaction.  ELISA  ELISA was carried out as described previously except for the antigen preparation . Initial assays were carried out to determine the optimal rMP and serum working dilutions. Plates were coated with serial dilutions of rMP (5 Á/200 ng/well) and tested with 2-fold dilutions (from 1:50 to 1:400) of a positive or negative dog sera. In subsequent assays, to determine sensitivity and specificity, plates were coated with the predetermined antigen concentration and serum dilutions.Briefly, ELISA plates were coated at 4 8C overnight with rMP (100 ng/well) suspended in Carbonate buffer (15 mM Na 2 CO 3 , 35 mM NaHCO 3 , [pH 9.6]). Then each well of the plate was incubated with blocking solution (0.2% gelatin in Carbonate buffer) for 90 min at 37 8C. The wells were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T). One hundred microliters of the primary antibody (dog sera) diluted 1:50 in PBS-T was added in duplicate and the plates were incubated for 90 min at 37 8C. After four washes with PBS-T, plates were then incubated with goat antidog IgG antibody labeled with peroxidase for 1 h at 37 8C. ABTS [2,2?-Azino-di-(3ethylbenzothiazoline sulfonate)] substrate (100 ml/well) was added after four washes with PBS-T and the wells were incubated for 25 min at room temperature. Fifty microliters of stop buffer (SDS 1%) was added to each well and the optical density (OD) was read at 405 nm. The cutoff value was defined as the mean OD plus three standard deviations calculated from the 16 negative samples used as control.  Results  The coding sequence for the M protein of CCoV was cloned in the pQE30 expression vector and the recombinant protein with a polyhistidine tag at the Nterminus was produced as inclusion bodies in the bacterial cytosol.After SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining, a protein band corresponding to the expected molecular mass of 30 kDa was revealed in IPTG-induced culture (Fig. 1, lane 2) and in the inclusion bodies fraction (not shown), which was not present either in the culture before the induction (Fig. 1, lanes 1) or in the control culture before and after the induction (not shown). The recombinant-tagged protein was detected by Western blotting using anti His tag monoclonal antibody. It was purified by electroelution and the purity was confirmed by single banding in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, lane 3) . The Nterminal sequence arg Á/gly Á/ser Á/his Á/his Á/his Á/his Á/his Á/ gly Á/ser Á/lys Á/ile Á/leu Á/leu Á/ile Á/leu Á/ala Á/cysÁ/ala also confirmed the authenticity of the rMP.In order to test the reactivity of rMP, Western blotting was carried out using a monoclonal antibody against the M protein of CCoV and both a CCoV positive and a CCoV negative dog serum. The protein band of 30 kDa showed a strong and specific reaction with the monoclonal antibody as well as with the CCoV positive serum whereas it was not recognized by the CCoV negative serum.To test the use of a rMP-based ELISA test, 34 positive dog sera and 16 negative sera were used. The mean and the standard deviation obtained using 16 CCoV negative sera were 0.017 and 0.00325, respectively. Therefore, the cutoff value of ODs was determined as 0.027. Thirty-four canine sera which tested positive by whole CCoV ELISA and Western blotting were determined to be also positive by rMP ELISA. Since the results of rMP-ELISA correlated with the results of the reference tests (whole virus ELISA and Western blotting), the relative sensitivity and specificity resulted unchanged.  Discussion  For detection of CCoV antibodies, several tests have been employed.The neutralization test is tedious to carry out and, as reported previously , it may fail to detect antibodies in some dog sera positive to CCoV. ELISA with whole virus was found more sensitive than the neutralization test, but the antigen prepared from CCoV infected cells may yield variable results depending on the method of antigen preparation.In this study, the rMp of CCoV was evaluated for its antigenicity and reliability in an ELISA for CCoV antibodies detection. Previous studies had demonstrated that, after CCoV infection, antibodies to the M protein are detected constantly in seropositive dogs . Based on these findings, we cloned and expressed the M protein of CCoV in E. coli . The rMP was similar antigenically to the natural protein as evidenced by its specific reactivity with both monoclonal antibody and dog positive control serum in Western blotting analysis.An ELISA with rMP was developed and then evaluated as an alternative diagnostic method. When the performance of the new test was compared with those using whole virus ELISA and Western blotting, it was found that the rMP-based ELISA correlated very well with the other assays since both gave concordant results.These findings indicate that the rMP may be useful as an ELISA antigen for detecting specific antibodies to CCoV in canine sera and offers several advantages over the cell-prepared CCoV antigen. High levels of M protein expression may be obtained in the E. coli system making the rMP-based ELISA easy to prepare and standardize. Also, the availability of large amounts of CCoV rMP offers an opportunity to better investigate the biological properties of the M protein during CCoV infection as well as its immunological role.  					1			
15109615	ACE2, a new regulator of the renin–angiotensin system	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128798/	Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc metalloproteinase and a key regulator of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). ACE2 is a newly described enzyme identified in rodents and humans with a more restricted distribution than ACE, and is found mainly in heart and kidney. ACE2 cleaves a single residue from angiotensin I (Ang I) to generate Ang 1–9, and degrades Ang II, the main effector of the RAS, to the vasodilator Ang 1–7. The importance of ACE2 in normal physiology and pathophysiological states is largely unknown. ACE2 might act in a counter-regulatory manner to ACE, modulating the balance between vasoconstrictors and vasodilators within the heart and kidney, and playing a significant role in regulating cardiovascular and renal function.	  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc metalloproteinase and a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). ACE2 is a newly described enzyme identified in rodents and humans with a more restricted distribution than ACE, and is found mainly in heart and kidney. ACE2 cleaves a single residue from angiotensin I (Ang I) to generate Ang 1 -9, and degrades Ang II, the main effector of the RAS, to the vasodilator Ang 1-7. The importance of ACE2 in normal physiology and pathophysiological states is largely unknown. ACE2 might act in a counter-regulatory manner to ACE, modulating the balance between vasoconstrictors and vasodilators within the heart and kidney, and playing a significant role in regulating cardiovascular and renal function.Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, is a key enzyme in the renin -angiotensin system (RAS); it converts the inactive decapeptide, angiotensin I (Ang I; or Ang 1-10), to the active octapeptide and potent vasoconstrictor Ang II (or Ang 1-8) (Figure 1 ), and inactivates the vasodilator bradykinin [1] . Ang II is thought to be responsible for most of the physiological and pathophysiological effects of the RAS, and inhibitors of ACE that reduce the formation of Ang II have been highly successful in the management of hypertension, are standard therapy following myocardial infarction to delay the development of heart failure, and reduce the rate of progression of renal disease [2, 3] .Recently, however, the classical view of the RAS has been challenged by the discovery of the enzyme ACE2 [4, 5] , in addition to the increasing awareness that many angiotensin peptides other than Ang II have biological activity and physiological importance [6] . The reported vasodilatory actions of Ang 1 -7 [6] , along with the potential involvement of ACE2 in both Ang II degradation and Ang 1-7 production, add another level of complexity to the RAS [7, 8] .It is predicted that cardiovascular disease will be the leading cause of death by 2020, and although current approaches to block the RAS have been of major benefit in this area, it is now clear that other pathways and enzymes within the RAS can modulate its main effector, Ang II. We must question our understanding of the 'classical' RAS, and work towards unravelling the complexity of the 'new' RAS ( Figure 1 ). This should result in alternative strategies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease in the future.ACE2 structure and function ACE2 is the first known human homologue of ACE, and was cloned from a human heart failure cDNA library [4] and a human lymphoma cDNA library [5] . Analysis of the genomic sequence of ACE2 has revealed that the gene contains 18 exons and maps to chromosomal location Xp22 [5] . The full-length, human ACE2 cDNA predicts a protein of 805 amino acids that has 42% homology with the N-terminal catalytic domain of ACE, and a hydrophobic region near the C-terminus, which probably serves as a membrane anchor. Like ACE, ACE2 is predicted to have the topology of a type 1 membrane protein, with the catalytic domain on the extracellular surface.Unlike somatic ACE, ACE2 has only one active enzymatic site and functions as a carboxypeptidase rather Figure 1 . The renin -angiotensin system (RAS) pathway. Schematic diagram of the classical RAS (left), showing the main pathway for angiotensin II (Ang II) generation from Ang I via angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). In the classical view, Ang II mediates all known effects via the AT1 receptor. On the right is the updated view of the RAS, showing the role of ACE2 in degrading Ang I to Ang 1 -9, and Ang II to the vasodilator Ang 1 -7. In this version of the RAS, Ang II also mediates effects via the G-protein-coupled AT2 receptor, whereas Ang 1 -7 acts through the Mas receptor. than a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase. Thus, ACE2 removes a single C-terminal Leu residue from Ang I to generate Ang 1 -9, a peptide with no known function. Although ACE2 was described originally for its ability to generate Ang 1 -9 from Ang I [4] , it also degrades Ang II to the biologically active peptide, Ang 1 -7 [9] ( Figure 1 ). Indeed, in vitro studies indicate that the catalytic efficiency of ACE2 for Ang II is 400-fold greater than for Ang I [9] , indicating that the major role for ACE2 is the conversion of Ang II to Ang 1 -7. The potential role of Ang 1 -7 as a cardioprotective peptide with vasodilator, anti-growth and anti-proliferative actions has been recognized relatively recently [6, 10] . Taken together, the data suggest that ACE2 might function to limit the vasoconstrictor action of Ang II through its inactivation, in addition to counteracting the actions of Ang II through the formation of the agonist, Ang 1 -7. Recent studies [11] have identified the G-protein-coupled receptor encoded by the MAS1 protooncogene, Mas, as the receptor for Ang 1-7 [11] . Genetic deletion of the Mas receptor abolished the binding of Ang 1 -7 to whole mouse kidney, whereas the functional significance of Ang 1 -7 and its receptor was demonstrated by studies showing that Mas-deficient mice could not respond with antidiuresis to Ang 1-7 after a water load, and that the aortas of Mas-deficient mice were unable to relax in response to Ang 1 -7 [11] .In addition, an unexpected function of ACE2 has recently been identified and characterized; ACE2 is a functional receptor for coronaviruses, including the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, and is involved in mediating virus entry and cell fusion [12, 13] . Although not directly relevant to cardiovascular function, this would indicate that the RAS including ACE2 has multiple roles in physiology and various pathophysiological states [13] .ACE2 distribution ACE2 has a much more restricted distribution compared with ACE, and in humans ACE2 transcripts have been identified in the heart, kidney and testis [4, 5] . Like ACE, ACE2 is found in endothelial cells, and is present to a lesser degree in vascular smooth muscle cells. In the kidney, ACE2 is found in the proximal tubular epithelium. Recently, ACE2 has been identified in the gastrointestinal tract, brain and lung [14] , suggesting a more ubiquitous distribution than initially thought.  ACE2 substrates  The precise physiological function of ACE2 is currently under intense investigation. There has been increasing interest in peptides that are either cleaved or generated by this enzyme. In addition to effects on the angiotensin peptides, ACE2 cleaves the C-terminal residue of the peptides des-Arg9-bradykinin, neurotensin 1 -13 and kinetensin [4] , and hydrolyses apelin-13 and dynorphin A 1 -13 with as high a catalytic efficiency as Ang II [9] . ACE2 has no effect on bradykinin, in contrast to ACE, emphasizing the specificity of ACE2 [4, 9] . Many of the in vitro substrates of ACE2 have actions that are relevant to cardiovascular regulation; apelin is a potent cardiac inotrope [15] , dynorphin A is an endogenous opioid neuropeptide and des-Arg9-bradykinin binds to the bradykinin B1 receptor, which is activated by inflammation and tissue injury [16] .It is not yet known whether the in vitro substrates of ACE2 are also physiological in vivo substrates, and further studies are needed that address in vivo changes in the levels of putative substrates or products of ACE2 using Ace2-knockout mice [17] , Ace2 transgenic animals [18] and ACE2 agonists, in addition to potent, selective ACE2 inhibitors [19, 20] . Interestingly, the in vitro enzymatic activity of ACE2 is unaffected by ACE inhibitors [4, 5] , but there are no data as to the effect of angiotensin receptor blockers on ACE2 activity. In the future, it will be of great interest to assess the in vivo effects of ACE2 inhibitors, particularly in light of the interesting findings with regard to cardiac function, which have been seen in both the Ace2knockout and transgenic animals [17, 18] .  ACE2 and hypertension  It has been hypothesized that ACE2 might protect against increases in blood pressure and that ACE2 deficiency leads to hypertension. In several rat models of experimental hypertension, the gene for ACE2 maps to a defined quantitative trait locus on the X chromosome previously identified as a quantitative locus for blood pressure [17] . An association between ACE2 and blood pressure has also been reported; in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and SHR stroke prone rats, renal ACE2 levels are reduced compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) [17] , and we have confirmed that renal Ace2 mRNA is reduced in SHR compared with WKY [21] . It is not clear whether ACE2 deficiency plays a pathophysiological role to cause hypertension or is simply a consequence of increased blood pressure, and the precise role of ACE2 in hypertension requires clarification.ACE2 and the heart Evidence of the biological role of ACE2 in angiotensin peptide degradation comes from studies in Ace2-knockout mice, which lack ACE2 protein [17] . These mice develop abnormal heart function, with severely impaired cardiac contractility, and the decrease in function is both sex and time dependent, with more severe abnormalities in male than in female mice, and a more pronounced phenotype in older animals. The importance of ACE2 in cleaving and/or inactivating Ang II is indicated by the increase in plasma, cardiac and kidney Ang II levels in the Ace2-knockout animals, and confirmed by studies in which genetic ablation of Aceon an Ace2 mutant background completely rescued the cardiac phenotype [17] .Hypoxia markers were also upregulated in the heart of the Ace2-knockout mice, suggesting that loss of ACE2 from the vascular endothelial cells resulted in coronary vessel constriction and reduced oxygen delivery to the myocytes [17] . Certainly, the localization of ACE2 in the rat and human heart to endothelial cells of intramyocardial blood vessels and smooth muscle cells supports a role for ACE2 in the control of local vasodilation. Although it was reported that ACE2 protein synthesis was similar in normal hearts and a failing heart from a single patient with idiopathic cardiomyopathy [4] , in a study of 14 Review subjects with idiopathic cardiomyopathy, there was an increase in functional cardiac ACE2 activity assessed by the ex vivo formation of Ang 1 -7 [22] .To date, there have been no published studies on cardiac ACE2 in the context of ischaemic heart disease. Given that marked stimulation of ACE and Ang II occurs after myocardial infarction [23] , ACE2 probably increases after myocardial infarction; this increase would limit the adverse effects of raised cardiac Ang II by increasing levels of the vasodilator Ang 1 -7. Support for this idea comes from studies in the rat myocardial infarction (MI) model, in which the development of heart failure was associated with increased Ang 1 -7 immunoreactivity [24] . Furthermore, infusion of Ang 1 -7 attenuated the development of heart failure after MI, confirming the functional significance of Ang 1 -7 [25] . It is possible that the relative balance of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator angiotensin peptides is important in the modulation of both haemodynamic and trophic effects of these peptides in the context of ischaemic heart disease.A word of caution is needed with regard to ACE2 and the heart. Although the data presented suggest that ACE2 and Ang 1 -7 might have cardioprotective effects after myocardial injury, in transgenic mice with increased cardiac Ace2 expression [18] , there was a high incidence of sudden death, which correlated with transgene expression levels. Electrophysiology revealed severe, progressive conduction and rhythm disturbances, with sustained ventricular tachycardia, that progressed to fibrillation and death. Clearly, further studies are needed to determine the functional relevance of ACE2 in the heart.  ACE2 and the kidney  Immunohistochemical studies by our group [26] and others [4] have shown that in the kidney, both ACE2 and ACE protein are localized predominantly to epithelial cells of the distal tubule. The RAS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, in particular diabetic nephropathy [27] , and ACE inhibition provides significant renoprotection. We have recently characterized ACE2 in the kidney of a rodent model of type 1 diabetes mellitus and compared and contrasted it with ACE [26] . Previous studies in the kidney using this model of diabetes demonstrated that ACE is downregulated in the renal tubules and upregulated in the glomerulus. In a recent study, we found that both ACE and ACE2 mRNA levels were decreased in diabetic renal tubules by , 50%. We also found that ACE2 protein synthesis is reduced in the diabetic kidney, and this reduction is prevented by ACE inhibitor therapy, suggesting that ACE2 might have a renoprotective role in diabetes [28] . Although there have been no other studies on the expression of ACE2 after renal tissue injury, the synthesis of collectrin, a protein with significant homology to ACE2 is upregulated in a model of progressive renal injury [29] .  Conclusion  The RAS has proved to be an important regulator of cardiovascular and renal structure and function, in addition to salt and water balance. Blockade of the RAS with ACE inhibitors or Ang II type 1 receptor antagonists has clearly established its key role in the pathophysiology of an increasing number of diseases, including hypertension, heart failure, ventricular remodelling, renoprotection and diabetic complications. These beneficial results are thought to result from blocking the vasoconstrictor, hypertrophic and proinflammatory actions of Ang II. The discovery of a new enzyme in the RAS pathway, ACE2, which produces the vasodilatory and antihypertrophic peptide Ang 1 -7, gives rise to the hypothesis that ACE2 provides a counter-regulatory system to Ang II, which might also contribute to the beneficial effects of RAS blockade.The identification of ACE2 in the heart and kidney, its modulation in heart failure and diabetes, and the recent description that this enzyme plays a biological role in the generation and degradation of angiotensin peptides provides a rationale for the further exploration of its role in pathophysiological states, including myocardial ischaemia, renal failure, atherosclerosis, and diabetic complications. Many questions remain to be answered about ACE2 (Box 1), in particular the impact of ACE2 on the generation of bioactive peptides, but clarification of the role of ACE2 in health and disease will be assisted by the development of agents that modulate ACE2 activity. The discovery of ACE2 has opened up an exciting new area of cardiovascular and renal physiology, in addition to providing the possibility of identifying novel therapeutic targets.  					1			
2541532	Development of protein A-gold immunoelectron microscopy for detection of bovine coronavirus in calves: Comparison with ELISA and direct immunofluorescence of nasal epithelial cells	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117413/	Abstract A protein A-colloidal gold immunoelectron microscopy (PAG-IEM) technique was developed for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCV) in the feces and nasal secretions of infected calves. Feces or nasal swab fluids were incubated sequentially with hyperimmune bovine anti-bovine coronavirus serum and protein A-gold, negatively stained, applied to formvar-coated copper grids and viewed using an electron microscope. The PAG-IEM method specifically identified BCV particles and possible subviral particles in feces and nasal-swab fluids from infected calves. The PAG-IEM method did not label other enveloped enteric viruses or morphologically similar fringed particles commonly found in feces. Detection of BCV using PAG-IEM was compared with ELISA and direct immunofluorescence (IF) of nasal epithelial cells by monitoring fecal and respiratory tract shedding of BCV from two experimentally infected and two naturally infected calves from birth to 3 weeks of age. PAG-IEM and ELISA detected shedding of BCV in fecal ( 4 4 animals) and nasal ( 3 4 animals) samples for an average of 5.25 days each. The observed agreement of BCV detection by PAG-IEM and ELISA was 85%. PAG-IEM may be a more sensitive immunoassay for the detection of BCV in diagnostic specimens from infected neonatal calves than ELISA. BCV infection of nasal epithelial cells was detected by immunofluorescence in 4 4 calves, persisted for the duration of the study in 2 4 calves and was sporadic in the other two animals. The observed agreement of BCV detection by PAG-IEM and IF was 57%.	INTRODUCTION  Bovine coronavirus (BVC) is a pneumoenteric virus which causes a mild upper respiratory tract infection and a severe lower intestinal enteritis in 3-30-day-old calves, resulting in diarrhea, dehydration and often death (Stair et al., 1972; Sharpee et al., 1976; Langpap et al., 1979; Phillips and Case, 1980; Thomas et al., 1982; McNulty et al., 1984; Reynolds et al., 1985; Saif et al., 1986; Bosgiraud and Nicolas, 1986; Heckert et al., 1986) . The virion is pleomorphic (65-210 nm) and has 20-25-nm long club-shaped peplomers anchored in a lipid envelope (Sharpee et al., 1976; Roseto et al., 1982) .Diagnosis of BCV enteric infections in live animals is often done by electron microscopy (EM) or immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) of material from diarrheic animals (Stair et al., 1972; England et al., 1976; McNulty et al., 1981 ) . Diagnosis of BCV upper respiratory tract infections is not routinely done but is possible by EM, IEM, virus isolation methods and direct immunofluorescence examination of nasal epithelial cells (Thomas et al., 1982; McNulty et al., 1984; Reynolds et al., 1985; Bosgiraud and Nicolas, 1986; Heckert et al., 1986; Sail et al., 1986) .Diagnosis of BCV infection by EM or IEM is dependent upon morphological identification of virus particles or immune complexes. Diarrheic material often contains particles which resemble BCV in morphology, making the positive identification of the virus difficult. In one study, a number of laboratories were sent known human coronavirus specimens for examination by negative-staining EM. Only 51% made a correct diagnosis; 33% found no virus and 16% reported a wrong virus in the specimen (Almeida, 1983 ) . The majority of these so-called coronaviruses are membrane fragments with a fringed surface. Unfortunately, endoplasmic reticulum, bacteria and mycoplasma, when broken down, yield fragments that assume spherical form and frequently display a fringe of surface projections. Similarly, the disrupted cristae of broken mitochondria have distinctive surface projections and can also appear in the viral size range (Almeida, 1983) .Protein A-colloidal gold immunoelectron microscopy (PAG-IEM) has been used to specifically detect rotavirus and enterovirus antigens in fecal samples (Hopley and Doane, 1985; Doane et al., 1987) . This paper reports the development ofa PAG-IEM method for the rapid and specific identification of BCV in feces and nasal secretions of infected calves. To evaluate its use as a diagnostic test, this method was used to follow the shedding of BCV in fecal and nasal samples from two naturally infected (NI) and two experimentally infected (EI) calves. The PAG-IEM method was compared with ELISA and direct immunofluorescence staining of nasal epithelial cells for the diagnosis of BCV infection in these calves.  Experimental design  Two groups of Holstein calves were used in this study. The first group consisted of two colostrum-deprived bull calves (Nos 213 and 214), procured, housed at birth in isolation facilities and challenged as described by Saif et al., (1983) . At 2 days of age each animal was inoculated with a 20% suspension of virulent DB2 strain of BCV in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 2 ml per nostril and 46 ml orally. The inoeulum consisted of large intestinal contents from a gnotobiotic calf previously infected with the DB2 strain of BCV . The inoculum contained approximately 50 virions per grid square by IEM and was known to cause diarrhea in 100% of challenged animals. Feces and nasal swabs were collected and rectal temperatures recorded daily for the first week of life and then three times per week until 3 weeks of age (EI group ).In the second group, two naturally infected heifer calves (Nos. 4682 and 4609) housed on a commercial diary farm under conventional management conditions, were sampled (as above) three times per week from birth until 3 weeks of age (NI group). The severity of diarrhea was scored on a scale of 0-3, with 0 representing firm feces; 1, pasty feces; 2, semi-liquid; 3, liquid. Upper respiratory tract signs were scored on a similar scale with 0 representing a normal amount and consistency of lacrimal, nasal and salivary secretions; 1, excessive clear secretions; 2, cloudy thick secretions.  PA G-IEM procedures  Fecal and nasal specimens Diarrheic material from calves containing Bredavirus (a Torovirus) (Saif et al., 1981; Woode et al., 1982; Horzinek et al., 1987) , fringed particles or no viruses and pig feces containing transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGE, a coronavirus of swine ) by IEM were examined by PAG-IEM. All fecal samples and nasal swab supernatants from the NI and EI groups of calves were also examined by PAG-IEM.  PAG-IEM  Fecal samples were stored at -20 ° C after collection and processed for PAG-IEM using procedures similar to those described previously (Saif et al., 1977) . Briefly, samples were diluted 1:5, sonicated, clarified at 4 °C and the supernatants passed through 0.45 pm filters (Uniflo, Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH). Nasal swab supernatants were filtered (0.45 pm), concentrated 10-fold by ultracentrifugation (99 000 ×g, 2 h, 4°C) and resuspended in 200 pl PBS. Fecal or nasal samples (200 #1) were incubated overnight at 4°C with appropriately diluted hyperimmune bovine anti-bovine coronavirus serum (800 pl) as described by Saif et al. (1986) . The immune complexes were pelleted twice (69 000 × g, 35 min, 4 ° C ), resuspended in 50 Bl sterile distilled H20 (EM water ) and incubated for 45 min at 37°C with 25/ll of 10 nm protein A-gold (PAG) (AuroProbe, EM protein-A G10, Janssen Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) diluted 1:20 in gold buffer (0.1% BSA in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.2). In select specimens, the PAG binding was blocked by the addition of 25/A (5 mg ml-1 ) of unlabeled protein A in gold buffer, as a control. Further incubations were carried out in microtiter plate wells as described by Hopley and Doane (1985) . The virus-antibody-PAG suspension (50/ll ) was transferred to a formvar carbon-coated copper EM grid (300 mesh) on top of 1% agar in a microtiter well and allowed to diffuse into the agar for 30 min at room temperature. Grids were washed by sequential immersion into two drops of gold buffer and one drop of EM water followed by negative staining with 1.5% phosphotungstic acid containing 0.2% sucrose (pH 7.2) for 30 s. Grids were blotted dry and examined at 80 kV in an electron microscope (Model 201, Philips Norelco, The Netherlands). The viral particles in a specimen were estimated on the basis of the following scale measured in number per grid square: < 1; >~ 1 ~< 10; >t 11 ~< 50; >~51~<100; >~101.  ELISA  All nasal swab supernatants and fecal samples collected were tested for BCV antigen by ELISA using procedures similar to those previously described for detection of bovine rotavirus (Saif et al., 1983) . Briefly, 96-well polystyrene plates (Immulon I, Dynatech Laboratories, Alexandria, VA) were coated with 200/ll hyperimmune (Rows A-F) or pre-immune (Rows G-H) ammonium sulfate-precipitated gnotobiotic calf anti-bovine coronavirus serum (25 /~g ml-1 ) in carbonate coating buffer (pH 9.6 ), at 37 ° C for 1 h and 4 ° C overnight. Plates were rinsed twice in PBS-Tween (Dynawasher II, Dynatech Laboratories, Alexandria, VA) and 100/A of feces [diluted 1:25 and processed as described previously {Saif et al., 1983) ] or undiluted nasal swab supernatants were added, each to four wells of positive capture serum and duplicate wells of negative control serum. Each set of duplicate samples (on positive capture antibody) received a further 100 #l of a 1:100 dilution of hyperimmune or preimmune ammonium sulfate precipitated bovine anti-bovine coronavirus serum, as a blocking test, followed by incubation overnight at 4 ° C. Plates were rinsed and 100/ll hyperimmune guinea pig anti-bovine coronavirus serum (1: 3000) in 2% BSA-PBS-Tween was added and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After rinsing, 100 ~l of rabbit anti-guinea pig alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:400) (ICN ImmunoBiologicals, Lisle, IL ) in 2 % BSA-PBS was added and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 ° C. Plates were rinsed twice, first with PBS-Tween, then with distilled H20, and 200/zl of the substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium, (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO ) in 10% diethanolamine was added. Color development was read at 405 nm (Titerteck Multiskan, Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA) when positive control wells reached an absorbence value of approximately 1.0. Fecal and nasal swab supernatants, previously determined as positive or negative for BCV by IEM, were included on all plates as controls. A cutoff absorbence value for each sample was determined by adding three standard deviations (of all the negative control samples and all samples on negative control serum) to the background absorbence value of the sample on negative control serum. Mean values were determined for each set of duplicate samples tested. A sample was considered positive if it was above the cut-off value for that sample and if its absorbence value was reduced (in the blocking test) by > 50% of the difference between the unblocked absorbence value and the cut-off absorbence value.  Direct immunofluorescence (IF) assay  Nasal epithelial cells were collected with 16.5-cm cotton-tipped swabs ( 1 per nostril) and fixed onto glass slides for immunofluorescence staining as described by Saif et al. (1986) . Nasal swab supernatants and fixed cells were stored at -20 ° C until further testing.Nasal cells were stained using fluorescein-conjugated bovine anti-bovine coronavirus serum, bovine anti-bovine rotavirus serum (control) or PBS as described previously . Wells were considered positive when they contained at least two specific fluorescing cells per well. The percentage of cells a>39.5°C. b0-3 as described in text. cVirus particles per grid square. d0-2 as described in text. +% immunofluorescent nasal cells.  Clinical signs of infected calves  All calves in both the EI and NI groups developed profuse watery diarrhea and became febrile (rectal temperature > 39.5 ° C) following BCV infection during the 3-week study period (Tables 1-4) . The average durations of diarrhea for calves in the EI and NI groups were 4.5 and 5.5 days, respectively.  PA G-IEM evaluation of specimens  The PAG-IEM method specifically labeled BCV viral particles in IEM positive fecal samples or supernatant fluids from IF positive nasal cells (Fig. 1) .

PAG-IEM also contained a variable amount of labeled free viral antigen of undefined morphology (Fig. 2 ) . The specificity of the labeling of this possible subviral material was demonstrated by comparative assays using positive and negative controls. Labeled free antigen of undefined morphology was never seen in PAG-IEM negative samples, but frequently seen in PAG-IEM positive samples. Labeling of the viral and subviral-antibody complexes by PAG was blocked by the addition of protein A, indicating that non-specific PAG aggregates were not occurring.The PAG-IEM method did not label the two enveloped viruses, Bredavirus or transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Fig. 3) , which are antigenically unrelated to BCV. Fringed particles and cellular debris in fecal samples IEM negative for BVC or supernatant fluids from cells IF negative for BCV were also unlabeled (Fig. 3) . The background level of free PAG was low in all specimens examined.  Detection of BCV fecal and nasal shedding by PAG-IEM  Shedding of BCV in feces and nasal swab fluids from the EI group of calves was detected by PAG-IEM. The average duration of BCV shedding in the feces and nasal swab fluids detected by PAG-IEM was 5 and 6 days, respectively, with levels of viral particles ranging from < 1 to > 101 per grid square (Tables  1 and 2 ).In the NI group of calves, fecal shedding of BCV was detected by PAG-IEM, but little or no nasal shedding was evident. The average duration of BCV shedding in the feces detected by PAG-IEM was 4.5 days with numbers of viral particles ranging from < 1 to > 101 per grid square. The average duration of BCV shedding in the nasal swab fluids by PAG-IEM was 0.5 days with numbers of viral particles ranging from 0 to < 1 per grid square (Tables 3 and 4 ).  Detection of BCV fecal and nasal shedding by ELISA  Shedding of BCV in feces and nasal swab fluids was detected by ELISA for an average duration of 4 and 6.5 days, respectively, from the EI group of calves and 2.5 and 0.5 days, respectively, from the NI group (Tables 1-4) .Detection of BCV shedding in feces or nasal swab fluids by PAG-IEM and ELISA were in good agreement (observed agreement of 85% ) for both EI and NI groups. By PAG-IEM and ELISA 23.5% of the fecal and nasal swab samples were positive, 61.2 % were negative, 11.2 % were PAG-IEM positive/ELISA negative and 4.1% PAG-IEM negative/ELISA positive (Table 5 ). This yields a Kappa value of 0.7. Kappa values > 0.75 represent excellent agreement and values < 0.45 represent poor agreement (Sackett et al., 1985) .   Immunofluorescence of nasal epithelial cells  Both EI calves had BCV-infected nasal epithelial cells, as detected by IF, within 24 h of BCV inoculation. The percentage of infected nasal epithelial cells increased rapidly, peaked at 2-3 days post-inoculation in both animals (15-25%), then decreased over the next 6-8 days to a low level (0.1%), which persisted for the duration of the study (3 weeks) in Calf 213 and almost to the end in Calf 214 (Tables 1 and 2 ).In contrast, the age at which BCV-infected nasal epithelial cells were first detected in the NI calves was variable (3 or 7 days of age). The percentage of BCV-infected cells (2-3%) and the period of peak detection (3-5 days) was less than the EI group. The nasal epithelial cell infection again persisted at a very low level (0.1%) for the duration of the study (although sporadic in Calf 4682) (Tables 3 and 4) .Detection of BCV upper respiratory tract infection by PAG-IEM and IF was in poor agreement (observed agreement of 57%) for both EI and NI groups. By PAG-IEM and IF 32.7% of the nasal swab samples were positive, 24.5% were negative, 2% PAG-IEM positive/IF negative and 40.8% PAG-IEM negative/IF positive (Table 6 ). This yields a Kappa value of 0.14, representing very poor agreement.  DISCUSSION  In the present study, protein A-gold immunoelectron microscopy was successfully used to detect bovine coronavirus in the feces and nasal secretions of infected calves. This technique did not specifically label an antigenically unrelated porcine coronavirus (TGE), a morphologically similar, but antigenically unrelated enveloped bovine enteric virus (Bredavirus) or morphologically similar fringed particles commonly found in feces. PAG-IEM clearly labeled only intact BCV or free BCV antigens of undefined morphology in calves infected with BCV but not coronavirus-like particles found in negative control or pre-challenge fecal samples. This ability of PAG-IEM to detect small subviral antigens has also been shown by others (Stannard et al., 1982; Louro and Lesemann, 1984; Hopley and Doane, 1985) . This is a distinct advantage over IEM since coronaviruses are fragile and peplomers easily break off making the identification of the virus difficult. The PAG-IEM method for detecting BCV in feces or nasal secretions compared well to ELISA with a Kappa value of 0.7. This study did not compare the sensitivities of the two assays, although others have shown that PAG-IEM is 1000 times more sensitive than direct electron microscopy and consistently more sensitive than standard IEM methods (Doane et al., 1987) . The increased sensitivity of the PAG-IEM method is probably related to the ability of PAG particles to bridge small antigen-antibody complexes (Hopley and Doane, 1985) . In the light of the re-ports that IEM is at least as efficient as ELISA, PAG-IEM appears to be one of the most sensitive of the immunoassays currently available (Nicolaieff et al., 1980; Obert et al., 1981; Kjeldsberg and Mortensson-Egnund, 1982; Rubenstein and Miller, 1982; Svensson et al., 1983; Hughes et al., 1984; Hopley and Doane, 1985 ) .PAG-IEM did not compare well with IF for the detection of upper respiratory tract infections in the calves studied. This would be expected since IF detects BCV-infected cells and not free BCV virions or antigens, as does PAG-IEM. As seen in Table 2 the majority of discrepant results were IF positive/ PAG-IEM negative, indicating that BCV upper respiratory tract infections do not always result in free virion release in numbers detectable by PAG-IEM.The ability of BCV to replicate in both the enteric and respiratory tracts of neonatal calves was confirmed as reported previously (Reynolds, 1983; Reynolds et al., 1985; Saif et al., 1986) . All animals developed a fever and profuse watery diarrhea, but only mild or no symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. However, the virus did replicate in the upper respiratory tract as indicated by IF positive nasal cells and virus detection from nasal swab supernatants by PAG-IEM and ELISA. It was not clear from this study whether the respiratory tract infection preceded the enteric infection or vice versa. There appeared to be a persistence of viral infection in the upper respiratory tract, as IF positive nasal epithelial cells were detected (at a very low percentage) in three of the animals for at least 2 weeks after viral shedding was first detected. This was a considerably longer period of shedding than reported by Reynolds et al. (1985) , from challenged gnotobiotic calves, but similar to that reported by Sail et al. (1986) .Owing to the high electron density of the (PAG) gold marker it can be detected at relatively low magnifications permitting rapid scanning of grids and improving the feasibility of doing viral diagnosis by EM methods. Although PAG-IEM may not be suited to large-scale screening of specimens, it is however, a highly sensitive and specific assay for the detection of viral particles or antigens in selected or questionable specimens.  				1	1			
15742856	Clinical Features and Outcomes of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Predictive Factors for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129615/	Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease, and indeed, the SARS epidemic in Taiwan from March to July 2003 had a great impact. This study depicts the clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes of patients with SARS treated at Taipei Veterans General Hospital; potential predictive factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are also analyzed. Methods This study retrospectively analyzed data for 67 SARS patients, who were grouped according to whether or not ARDS developed during the clinical course of SARS. Results There were 32 males (mean age, 50.3 years; range, 20–75 years) and 35 females (mean age, 51.1 years; range, 23–86 years). Twenty-five patients (37.3%) were health care workers. At admission, 50 patients (74.6%) had abnormal chest radiographs, and all patients developed pulmonary infiltrates during the following week. During hospitalization, lymphopenia was found in 57 patients (85.1%); and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; n = 55; 83.3%), C-reactive protein (n = 55; 83.3%), aminotransferases (n = 44; 65.7%), and creatine kinase (n = 14; 20.9%) were also noted. ARDS developed in 33 patients (49.3%), who were generally older than the patients in whom ARDS did not develop, male, non-health care workers, and who generally had dyspnea at the time of diagnosis, and a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension or cerebrovascular accident. Patients with, versus those without, ARDS also tended to present with more severe lymphopenia and leukocytosis, and with higher levels of LDH and aspartate aminotransferase. The overall mortality rate was 31.3% (21/67), whereas the rate for patients who developed ARDS was 63.6% (21/33). Multivariate analyses showed that age greater than 65 years (odds ratio, OR, 10.6; 95% confidence interval, CI, 2.1–54.1), pre-existing diabetes mellitus (OR, 13.7; 95% CI, 1.3–146.9), and elevated levels of LDH (OR, 8.4; 95% CI, 1.9–36.9) at admission, were independent predictors of ARDS. Conclusion The clinical manifestations of SARS showed high variability, and were related to the underlying health status of individual patients. Importantly, the development of ARDS was associated with significant mortality, despite aggressive therapy.	Introduction  Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious pulmonary disease that appears to have originated in southern China in the fall of 2002. The disease then spread to other parts of Asia, Europe and North America, with more than 8,000 cases now reported worldwide. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] The first two SARS cases in Taiwan were diagnosed in a couple on March 14, 2003;  6 the man had traveled to Guangdong Province and Hong Kong in February 2003. The couple was treated successfully in an intensive care unit (ICU) at medical center A. Subsequently, most SARS patients were treated at that medical center, until two clusters of cases were noted in late April, 2003, in Taipei. The origin of the outbreak was a laundry worker, aged 42 years, with diabetes mellitus, who was employed at hospital B. 7 As the index patient had been symptomatic for 6 days before SARS was diagnosed, the number of potentially exposed persons was estimated to be 10,000 patients and visitors, and 930 staff. Within less than 2 weeks, another outbreak of SARS clusters occurred in hospital C, which is near hospital B. Taipei Veterans General Hospital undertook the care of critically ill SARS patients, who were mainly transferred from hospital B and hospital C. The cause of SARS is a novel coronavirus. [8] [9] [10] [11] Natural clinical histories have ranged from febrile respiratory symptoms, without hypoxemia, to respiratory distress requiring intubation and, occasionally, resulting in death. [3] [4] Worldwide, the substantial mortality associated with SARS has varied markedly from 15-27%. 5 This paper provides a retrospective review of predictive factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with SARS treated at Taipei Veterans General Hospital.  Clinical diagnostic criteria  The following criteria were used to evaluate the probability of SARS: 1. A history of close contact with a SARS patient, or evidence of traveling to SARS-endemic areas within 10 days before symptom onset. 2. Acute onset of fever > 38 C. 3. Respiratory symptoms, including cough or dyspnea. 4. Chest radiograph showing patchy or spotty pulmonary infiltrates. 5. ARDS without an identifiable cause. 6. Evidence of the transmission of pneumonia.Patients fulfilling criteria 1+2+3 were defined as suspected cases, while those meeting criteria 1+2+3+4, 2+3+5, or 2+3+4+6 were defined as probable cases. A diagnosis of SARS was not made if an alternative diagnosis could fully explain the illness. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), or antibodies for SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), were used to confirm the diagnosis, but were not part of the diagnostic criteria.  Study patients  This study included all patients with SARS admitted to Taipei Veterans General Hospital between March 20 and July 5, 2003, even though 14 cases in our cohort were reported previously by Chiang et al. 12 Thirtythree patients were referred due to evidence of SARS noted at another hospital. These patients were categorized according to the most severe clinical condition, i.e. non-ARDS or ARDS, with ARDS defined according to the American-European consensus conference: 13 1. Non-ARDS: patients with a ratio of partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO 2 )/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO 2 ) > 200 mmHg, and who did not develop ARDS during their stay in the ward. 2. ARDS: patients with PaO 2 /FIO 2 200 mmHg, and with bilateral lung infiltrates at admission or during their stay in the ward.  Treatment  All patients were isolated for treatment, which included antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infection. The choice of antibiotics was based on empirical knowledge of the common atypical pathogens encountered in the community. Other antibiotics were administered to patients with established bacterial infection according to the results of drug-sensitivity testing after bacterial culture. The administration of ribavirin, intravenous immunoglobulin or corticosteroids was determined by physicians. Patients were intubated when respiratory failure developed, i.e. PaO 2 < 90% during the administration of 100% supplemental oxygen with or without a respiratory rate of more than 35 breaths per minute.  Study design  A clinical database was constructed to document patient demographics, including the following: date of onset of initial symptoms; initial abnormal radiographic findings; date of admission to the hospital; tracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation; other comorbid conditions; and treatments for, and short-term outcomes of, the acute illness. The main parameters monitored at, and every 2-3 days after, hospital admission comprised complete blood count (CBC), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and blood gases. Chest films were taken daily during the early hospital stay, and every 2-5 days during convalescence. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV was performed routinely on nasopharyngeal swabs on days 1 and 7 of hospitalization. Assays for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies were performed on day 21 of hospitalization, and 2 weeks after hospital discharge.  Statistical analysis  We compared differences in epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory measures between patients who developed ARDS and those who did not. Square-root transformation was performed, for CBCs and biochemical parameters, for the normality of data. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to check normality. The Student's t test was adapted to normal-distribution data. For continuous variables not fitted to a normal distribution, median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were calculated as summaries of distribution, and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was adapted for comparison. A Chi-squared test was used to compare the category variables. For calculating the odds ratio of ARDS in the logistic regression analysis, each variable was dichotomized using a "normal-limits" value as cutoff (except for CRP [cut-off, 5 mg/L] and age [65 years]). To dichotomize the variable "comorbidities", the study group was divided into patients with (value of 1) or without underlying disease (value of 0). A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were carried out using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 11.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).  Demographics and clinical information  A total of 67 patients with SARS were admitted to our hospital between March 20 and July 5, 2003, which represented 10% (67 of 668) of all documented, probable SARS cases in Taiwan. The patients comprised 32 men and 35 women; mean age standard deviation (SD) was 51.0 21.9 years (range, 23-86 years) ( Table 1) . Twenty-five patients (37.3%) were medical professionals and the others had various occupations. Thirty-three (49.3%) patients required mechanical ventilatory support. Patients without ARDS were significantly younger than patients with ARDS (39.1 16.5 years vs 63.4 20.0 years). All patients received nasopharyngealswab RT-PCR tests routinely on days 1 and 7 of hospitalization, and only 22 patients (32.8%) had positive findings. Thirty-three patients had assays for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies on day 21 of hospitalization; 28 of them (84.8%) had positive findings. The most common initial clinical symptoms were fever (95.5% of patients), cough (65.7%) and dyspnea (49.3%); watery diarrhea was noted in less than 20% of patients. Fortytwo patients (62.7%) had other comorbid conditions, which principally included diabetes mellitus (n = 16), viral hepatitis (n = 12), hypertension (n = 13), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA; n = 8). Levofloxacin was used in a total of 49 patients (73.1%), whereas other antibiotics were used significantly more frequently in patients with ARDS rather than in those without (26 vs 17; p = 0.021). The administration of ribavirin, intravenous immunoglobulin or corticosteroids did not differ significantly between patients with ARDS and those without, although pulse corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone 500 mg intravenously every 12 hours for 2-3 days) was given to four patients with ARDS versus none of the non-ARDS patients (p = 0.053). The mean length of hospital stay was significantly shorter for patients without ARDS than for survivors of ARDS (19.8 days vs 39.3 days; p < 0.001) ( Table 1) .The overall mortality rate was 31.3% (21 of 67 patients), whereas the mortality rate for patients who underwent mechanical ventilation was 63.6% (21 of 33).  Laboratory data  Laboratory indices during hospitalization are summarized in Table 2 . Sixteen patients (23.9%) had a leukocyte count < 3,500/mm 3 , 57 (85.1%) had a lymphocyte count < 1,000/mm 3   Radiographic findings  Chest radiographs revealed changes relating to pneumonia, although 17 patients (25.4%) did not have pulmonary infiltrates at initial radiograph. Combined central and peripheral lesions were evident in most patients, and most had rapid progression from a single localized lesion. The most common locations were the bilateral lower lung regions (Table 3 ). In the 17 patients with an initial normal radiograph, and who subsequently developed consolidation, the average time from fever onset to an abnormal radiograph was 4.6 6.8 days (range, 1-13 days).  Predictive factors for ARDS  We used a logistic multiple regression model to uncover risk factors for the development of ARDS. This model included LDH, CRP, age more than 65 years, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, previous CVA, and male gender, from univariate logistic regression analyses. Odds ratios for ARDS development in the 67 patients with SARS (Table 4 ).  Discussion  Taiwan has had the third largest number of SARS cases, after Hong Kong and China. To date, however, no large, formal analysis of the data from Taiwan can Since our hospital was responsible for the management of critical cases in northern Taiwan, the outcomes shown were more severe than in other medical settings. Initial clinical presentations and laboratory features were similar to those in other series. Symptoms of acute respiratory distress developed in about half of the patients (33/67; 49.3%); 21 of these patients (63.6%) died and the other 12 were discharged from hospital. The risk factors for ARDS were age more than 65 years, diabetes mellitus, and elevated LDH level. Other researchers have also documented independent predictors associated with poor outcomes, e.g. acute illness leading to death; the need for mechanical ventilation; and ICU admission. 2 The diagnosis of SARS was based on a comprehensive contact history and precise laboratory tests. The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for SARS have a reported sensitivity of 26% and specificity of 96%, 14 whereas the sensitivity of laboratory testing for SARS-CoV is less than 80%. 15 Since contact history has not been reliable after SARS cluster cases were noted in some community groups, one needed to be highly suspicious of any transmission of pneumonia. Our inclusion criteria added a component of transmission of pneumonia, and a high degree of clinical diagnostic accuracy was confirmed by laboratory tests. Hematologic abnormalities, especially lymphopenia, were common in our cohort, probably because of ribavirin therapy. Intravenous immunoglobulin was given when more severe hematologic abnormalities occurred. Pancytopenia and hemophagocytosis were noted in 2 patients without ARDS. This pheno-menon has been noted in other viral infections, and the outcome was fair after supportive treatment. 16, 17 In our cohort, elevation of AST was more obvious than that of ALT in the ARDS group. Since carriers of hepatitis B virus did not show profound lung injury, whether SARS-CoV will interact with hepatitis B virusis not yet clear. The location of pulmonary infiltration in SARS patients has been reported to be the peripheral lungs. 18, 19 In our cohort, initial infiltrative lesions were mainly located in the central and peripheral lungs. The best explanation for this is that anterior and posterior peripheral lesions would be projected to a central location on posteroanterior chest radiograph. The efficacy of treatment was difficult to evaluate because patients usually received a combination of medications, including antiviral, broad-spectrum antibacterial and corticosteroid drugs, in addition to supportive therapy. Initially, because the cause of SARS was thought to be an atypical pathogen, 55 patients (82.1%) received empiric antibacterial therapy with a fluoroquinolone. Levofloxacin was the drug of choice in 49 patients (73.1%) because of its broad-spectrum activity against anaerobic and aerobic Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria. In patients who developed ARDS, stronger antibiotics such as fourth-generation cephalosporins, teicoplanin and carbapenems were more often used. There is no proven effective treatment for SARS; hence, there was no difference in the proportion of patients per group who received the antiviral ribavirin, intravenous immunoglobulin, or moderate amounts of corticosteroids. However, pulse corticosteroid therapy was more often used for ARDS than non-ARDS patients.Our study has several limitations. It was retrospective and had no standard medical chart for following clinical courses. Some important information may, therefore, have been lost, which may have led to bias in the comparison. To date, however, this is the largest clinical analysis of SARS in Taiwan.  				1	1			
18539341	Lymphoid chemokines in chronic neuroinflammation	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125843/	Abstract Lymphoid chemokines play an essential role in the establishment and maintenance of lymphoid tissue microarchitecture and have been implicated in the formation of tertiary (or ectopic) lymphoid tissue in chronic inflammatory conditions. Here, we review recent advances in lymphoid chemokine research in central nervous system inflammation, focusing on multiple sclerosis and the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. We also highlight how the study of lymphoid chemokines, particularly CXCL13, has led to the identification of intrameningeal B-cell follicles in the multiple sclerosis brain paving the way to the discovery that these abnormal structures are highly enriched in Epstein–Barr virus-infected B cells and plasma cells.	Introduction  Lymphoid or homeostatic chemokines, including CCL19, CCL21, CXCL12 and CXCL13, are constitutively expressed in lymphoid organs and regulate the migration and compartmentalization of lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells within lymphoid tissues (Yoshie et al., 1997; Zlotnik et al., 1999) . CCL19 and CCL21 are ligands for CCR7 and are produced by stromal cells and dendritic cells in the T cell zone (Cyster, 1999) . CCL21 is also expressed in endothelial cells in high endothelial venules (HEV) and lymphatic vessels (Cyster, 1999) . Genetic and functional studies have established an important role for these chemokines in dendritic cell and T cell trafficking to T cell areas of secondary lymphoid organs (Yoshie et al., 1997; Müller et al., 2003) . CXCL13 is produced by stromal cells in B cell areas (follicles), binds to CXCR5 and regulates homing of B cells and subsets of T cells (follicular B helper T cells) to lymphoid follicles (Förster et al., 1996; Legler et al., 1998; Ansel et al., 2000; Moser et al., 2002; Müller et al., 2003) . CXCL12 is expressed broadly, acts as a potent chemoattractant for different types of immune cells by binding CXCR4, regulates hematopoiesis and, together with CXCL13, mediates germinal center organization in secondary lymphoid organs Allen et al., 2004) . Chemokine expression in T and B cell areas of lymphoid organs is dependent on lymphotoxin (LT) α1β2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling through the LTβR and TNFR1, respectively (Mackay and Browning, 1998; Ngo et al., 1999; Fu and Chaplin, 1999) .Over the past several years it has become evident that, in addition to their role in lymphoid tissue development and maintenance, lymphoid chemokines are also implicated in inflammation. Since the early 70's histopathologists have observed that in chronic inflammatory conditions, like autoimmunity and infections, the immune cells infiltrating the target organs may organize themselves in structures that resemble the T and B cell areas of secondary lymphoid organs, the so called tertiary or ectopic lymphoid organs (Hjelmström, 2001) . The discovery that lymphoid chemokines are involved in the formation of ectopic lymphoid tissue has led to the recognition that this process (also termed lymphoid neogenesis) shares similar mechanisms with lymphoid organogenesis (Cupedo and Mebius, 2003) . Following the initial observation that CXCL13 is expressed in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid structures (Mazzucchelli et al., 1999) and the findings of elegant studies showing that transgenic expression of LT (Kratz et al., 1996; Drayton et al., 2003) or individual lymphoid chemokines (Fan et al., 2000; Luther et al., 2000 Luther et al., , 2002 Chen et al., 2002b; Martin et al., 2004) in non-lymphoid tissues (pancreas, thyroid) leads to formation of lymphoid-like structures, the role of lymphoid chemokines in regulating immune cell trafficking and organization of ectopic lymphoid tissue in inflammatory conditions has received increasing attention (Aloisi and Pujol-Borrell, 2006; Drayton et al., 2006) . Formation of ectopic lymphoid tissue is viewed as part of an adaptive response against infection but may also have the potential to support autoimmunity through expansion and activation of autoreactive B and T lymphocytes (reviewed in Aloisi and Pujol-Borrell, 2006) . In this article, we summarize current knowledge of lymphoid chemokines in neuroinflammation, particularly in multiple sclerosis, the most common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS), and the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), as these are the disease conditions in which lymphoid chemokines have been mostly investigated. We also review how the study of this particular set of molecules has led us to achieve novel and unexpected insights into the elusive aetiopathogenesis of MS.  CCL19 and CCL21  In an early study addressing the role of lymphoid chemokines in the CNS, Sergio Lira's group showed that contrary to what had been observed in the pancreas, transgenic expression of CCL21 in the brain parenchyma was not associated with lymphocyte recruitment or lymphoid neogenesis (Chen et al., 2002a) , suggesting the existence of tissuespecific requirements for the biological activity of CCL21. Concomitantly, Alt et al. (2002) described functional expression of CCL19 and CCL21 in inflamed venules in the brain and spinal cord of mice with EAE and suggested that these chemokines besides regulating lymphocyte trafficking in lymphoid organs were also involved in the migration of encephalitogenic T cells in the CNS. We and others also found upregulation of CCL19, CCL21 and their common receptor CCR7 in CNS inflammatory lesions of mice with EAE, particularly during the chronic phase Bagaeva et al., 2006; Bielecki et al., 2007) .Further support to the idea that CCR7-binding chemokines could play a role in neuroinflammation was provided by analyses of brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with inflammatory neurological diseases. Several studies showed increased amounts of CCL19 in the CSF of patients with MS and with infectious diseases of the CNS as compared to patients with non-inflammatory neurological disease, whereas CCL21 was less consistently detected (Pashenkov et al., 2003; Giunti et al., 2003; Krumbholz et al., 2007) . Krumbholz et al. (2007) also described constitutive gene expression of CCL19 in normal brain tissue and elevation of CCL19 transcripts in MS lesions, suggesting a role for CCL19 both in normal immune surveillance of the CNS and in inflammatory conditions. In the MS CSF, CCL19 levels were found to correlate with intrathecal Ig production, but only weakly with CSF cell counts (Pashenkov et al., 2003; Krumbholz et al., 2007) . The observation that CCL21 mRNA and protein are undetectable in MS inflammatory lesions and meninges (Kivisäkk et al., 2004; Serafini et al., 2004; Krumbholz et al., 2007) is consistent with the absence of markers of HEV and lymphatic vessels in the MS brain Serafini and Aloisi, unpublished data) . These findings are in contrast with data obtained in the EAE model (Cannella et al., 1990; Alt et al., 2002; Columba-Cabezas et al., 2003) , suggesting species differences and/or existence of disease-specific mechanisms in the acquisition of HEV-like features by CNS blood vessels. However, Kivisäkk et al. (2004) reported expression of CCL21 in the human choroid plexus in both non-inflammatory and inflammatory CNS conditions.Interestingly, abundant expression of CCR7 was found in activated, resident microglia and myeloid dendritic cells but not in lymphocytes infiltrating MS lesions (Kivisäkk et al., 2004; Serafini et al., 2006) , whereas CCR7 was consistently found on most CD4+ memory T cells obtained from the CSF of individuals without CNS inflammation and of patients with MS (Giunti et al., 2003; Kivisäkk et al., 2003) . About 30% of the dendritic cells present in the CSF of MS patients were also found to express CCR7 (Kivisäkk et al., 2004) . The latter findings suggest that CCL19 could be involved in the trafficking of CCR7+ T lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells through the ventricular compartment and perhaps from this compartment to CNS-draining lymph nodes. Upregulation of CCR7 on activated microglia is intriguing as it suggests regulation of microglia migratory properties or function by lymphoid chemokines (Dijkstra et al., 2006) .  CXCL12  CXCL12 is a chemokine that is constitutively expressed in the CNS (Lazarini et al., 2003) and is upregulated during inflammation. Increased levels of CXCL12 have been detected in the CSF of patients with MS and other inflammatory neurological diseases (Pashenkov et al., 2003; Giunti et al., 2003; Corcione et al., 2004; Krumbholz et al., 2006) . Cerebrovascular endothelia and astrocytes have been identified as major sources of CXCL12 in inflamed MS lesions (Ambrosini et al., 2005; Krumbholz et al., 2006) . Because CXCR4 is expressed on immature myeloid dendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, T cells, B cells and plasma cells , it is likely that CXCL12 production in the CNS regulates intracerebral homing of different immune cell populations. Using in vitro assays, we demonstrated that human astrocytes release biologically relevant amounts of B-, T-and dendritic cell-attracting chemokines, including CXCL12 (Ambrosini et al., , 2005 . It is interesting to note that some plasma cells infiltrate the parenchyma in chronic MS lesions , where abundant expression of CXCL12 in activated astrocytes is also noted (Ambrosini et al., 2005) . Because plasma blasts can use CXCL12 as a chemoattractant, it is likely that the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis plays a role in creating, together with B-cell survival factors like BAFF (Krumbholz et al., 2005) , a survival niche for antibody-producing cells inside the brain parenchyma.  CXCL13  Because abnormal humoral immune responses characterized by intrathecal accumulation of B cells and plasma cells, B-cell clonal expansions and Ig synthesis are a prominent feature of MS and several infectious diseases of the CNS (reviewed in Uccelli et al., 2005) , several recent studies have addressed the role of the B-cell attracting chemokine CXCL13 in CNS inflammation. In 2004, our group reported induction of CXCL13 mRNA in the CNS of mice with EAE and by using immunohistochemical techniques showed that CXCL13expressing cells were present inside large B-cell aggregates in the inflamed brain meninges . We also provided evidence that such abnormal B-cell aggregates exhibited some features of germinal center organization as they comprised proliferating B cells and a reticulum of stromal/ follicular dendritic cells, which constitutively produce CXCL13 in B-cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs. These observations led us to propose that CNS inflammation, through local production of LTα1β2 and TNF by tissue-infiltrating immune cells (Columba-Cabezas et al., 2006) , induces expression of CXCL13 which in turn attracts B cells and promotes their compartmentalization with formation of germinal centers in the inflamed CNS meninges. In agreement with our findings, Bagaeva et al. (2006) found upregulation of CXCL13 mRNA and protein and infiltration of CXCR5+ cells in the spinal cord of EAE-affected mice.The subsequent step was to find out whether CXCL13 and germinal center-like structures could be detected in the MS brain. In a first immunohistochemical analysis of post-mortem brain tissue from 6 MS cases with relapsing-remitting and progressive clinical courses, we observed the presence of B-cell aggregates containing a well developed network of CXCL13expressing cells, numerous proliferating B cells, plasma cells and T cells in the subarachnoid space (the space lying between the pial and arachnoid membranes and filled with CSF) of 2 of 3 cases with secondary progressive MS . Notably, despite prominent, perivascular accumulation of B cells and plasma cells in chronic white matter lesions, neither CXCL13 nor proliferating B cells were detected at these sites, suggesting that the meninges, but not the Virchow-Robin space surrounding CNS intraparenchymal blood vessels, provide a permissive milieu for lymphoid neogenesis. Because chemokine-producing stromal cells in lymphoid organs are of mesenchymal origin (Parsonage et al., 2005) , we hypothesized that stromal cells involved in the organization of MS ectopic follicles could differentiate from precursors residing in the meninges or migrating there from the blood circulation . The above findings were confirmed in a larger set of brain specimens from cases with primary and secondary progressive MS (n = 36) . Variable numbers of intrameningeal B cell follicles, all containing CXCL13-producing stromal cells, were detected only in the brain of a proportion of cases that had developed secondary progressive MS (12 out of 29 examined), but in none of the 7 cases with primary progressive MS analyzed. In Fig. 1 , an intrameningeal B-cell follicle stained for the pan B-cell marker CD20 and for CXCL13 is shown (panels A and B, respectively).At variance with our findings Magliozzi et al., 2007) , Krumbholz et al. (2006) reported increased CXCL13 immunoreactivity in active MS lesions, both in the perivascular cuffs and inside the parenchyma, and confirmed CXCL13 expression in MS brain tissue by using real time PCR. Since it has been reported that macrophages and dendritic cells can produce CXCL13 under inflammatory conditions (Perrier et al., 2004; Carlsen et al., 2004) , discrepant immunohistochemical findings in the MS brain could be due to technical issues or differences in the inflammatory activity of the lesions analyzed. Krumbholz et al. (2006) also demonstrated increased levels of CXCL13 in the CSF of patients with MS and other inflammatory neurological diseases and found a correlation between CXCL13 concentration and presence of B cells, plasma blasts, T cells and intrathecally produced Ig in the CSF. In addition, the same group detected expression of the CXCL13 receptor CXCR5 on nearly all B cells and on a proportion of T cells isolated from the CSF of MS patients.Taken together, the above studies link CXCL13 expression in the CNS with the degree of inflammation and the development of ectopic lymphoid structures and point to CXCL13 as an attractive target for therapeutic interventions aimed at blocking B-cell recruitment and/or lymphoid neogenesis in the inflamed CNS. In a study performed in the EAE model we found that blocking LTα1β2 signaling with the fusion protein LTβR-Ig, which acts as a decoy receptor (Browning et al., 1997) , reduced EAE severity and prevented induction of CXCL13 and formation of organized B-cell follicles in the meninges, but failed to inhibit intrameningeal B-cell migration and aggregation (Columba-Cabezas et al., 2006) . We interpreted these findings as evidence that CXCL13 may be more important for the development of ectopic lymphoid tissue than for B-cell recruitment in the CNS. Along the same lines, Bagaeva et al. (2006) showed that both CXCL13-deficiency and treatment with anti-CXCL13 neutralizing antibodies reduced clinical severity in EAE and proposed that CXCL13 may coordinate the localization and interactions of immune cells within the CNS rather than attracting CXCR5+ cells from the periphery. Interestingly, CXCL13 expression was not induced in the CNS of mice developing encephalomyelitis after infection with neurotropic coronavirus despite prominent accumulation of virus-specific antibody-secreting cells in the target tissue, a finding that may suggest lack of ectopic B-cell follicle formation (Tschen et al., 2006) . In this model, CXCL9 and CXCL10, both of which act on plasma blasts through CXCR3, have been implicated in the recruitment of antibody-producing cells in the infected CNS (Tschen et al., 2006) .Increased expression of CXCL13 was also found in the brain and CSF of patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis, a chronic infection in which B-cell activation, plasma cell infiltration and enhanced Ig production in the CNS are a prominent feature (Narayan et al., 2005; Rupprecht et al., 2006) . Moreover, CXCL13 has been detected in primary CNS lymphoma where it is produced by malignant B cells and transported on the luminal surface of cerebrovascular endothelial cells (Smith et al., 2003; Brunn et al., 2007) , suggesting that this chemokine may influence tumor development and localization in the CNS.  Pathological relevance of ectopic lymphoid tissue in MS  Because ectopic lymphoid tissue forming in an inflamed tissue could sustain a local immune response against microbial or self antigens, the discovery of B-cell follicles in the MS brain raised a number of questions concerning the possible contribution of these structures to MS immunopathology, particularly to intrathecal Ig synthesis Aloisi and Pujol-Borrell, 2006) .Careful analysis of the cerebral cortex adjacent to ectopic B-cell follicles revealed the presence of demyelinated lesions whose extension and degree of neuronal loss and microglia activation were greater than those observed in the cerebral cortex of MS cases with lower meningeal inflammation . Of importance, such a dramatic pattern of cortical pathology correlated with a more severe disease course in MS cases with follicles compared to those without . These findings suggested the possibility that ectopic B-cell follicles are a source of diffusible factors, such as (auto)antibodies, pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or proteolytic enzymes, that cause injury to neural cells directly or through induction of microglia activation.Further immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ectopic B-cell follicles in MS meninges also contain numerous CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, both of which play an essential role in antiviral responses. This observation prompted us to search for the presence of a viral agent inside these abnormal structures . The most likely candidate appeared to be Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) for two main reasons. The first one stems from the bulk of seroepidemiological data and immunological findings supporting an association between EBV infection and MS (reviewed in Ascherio and Munger, 2007; Lünemann et al., 2007) . The second one was related to the unique ability of EBV to establish a latent infection in B cells and, through expression of viral latency proteins, to drive B-cell proliferation and activation (Thorley-Lawson, 2001) , these features being compatible with the presence of expanded B cell clones and Ig-producing plasma cells in the MS brain (Uccelli et al., 2005) . The prediction turned out to be correct as in situ hybridization for EBV- Fig. 1 . CXCL13 in MS ectopic B-cell follicles and CSF. Immunostainings for the pan B-cell marker CD20 (A) and for the lymphoid chemokine CXCL13 (B) were performed on serial brain sections from a case with secondary progressive MS, as previously described . An intrameningeal B-cell follicle comprising numerous CD20+ B cells (A) aggregated around a network of CXCL13+ stromal cells/follicular dendritic cells (B) is shown. In situ hybridization for EBER (C) and immunostaining for the EBV latent protein LMP1 (D) (see Serafini et al., 2007 for staining protocols) reveal enrichment in EBV-infected cells inside the same B-cell follicle shown in A, B. Original magnifications: 250× in A, C and D, 1000× in B. Panel E shows the levels of CXCL13 protein in post-mortem CSF of MS cases that were classified as EBV-high (n = 7) and EBV-low (n = 9) based on the frequency of EBV-infected cells accumulating in the meninges and in white matter lesions . The levels of CXCL13 are significantly higher in the CSF of MS cases characterized by more prominent deposits of EBV infection in brain tissue. CXCL13 levels were determined with a quantitative sandwich ELISA, in accordance with manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) . Bars indicate median values. Between-group comparison was performed by Mann-Whitney test. encoded small RNAs (EBER) and immunohistochemical stainings for two EBV latency proteins (EBNA-2, LMP1) revealed that ectopic B-cell follicles were highly enriched in EBV-infected cells ) (see Fig. 1C , D for EBER and LMP1 stainings, respectively). EBER+ cells were identified essentially as B cells and plasma cells. Variable numbers of EBV-infected cells were also detected in the meninges and perivascular immune infiltrates of active white matter lesions in nearly 100% of the MS cases analyzed (21 out of 22 with different clinical courses), their frequency being correlated with the degree of inflammation. Expression of markers of the EBV lytic cycle appeared restricted to acute inflammatory lesions in the white matter of MS cases with progressive disease and was abundant in the highly inflamed brain of cases with very severe, fulminant MS. Of note, EBV lytic proteins were consistently found in ectopic B-cell follicles indicating that these structures represent major occult sites of viral reactivation in the MS brain .We also provided evidence that CD8+ T cells accumulating in ectopic follicles and active MS lesions show signs of activation, such as proliferation and IFN-γ production, and display cytotoxic activity toward EBV-infected B cells/plasma cells . These findings led us to propose that a CNS compartmentalized and dysregulated infection with EBV drives MS-associated immunopathology through expansion and activation of latently infected B cells, periodic viral reactivation, and induction of an EBV-specific cytotoxic immune response. Most probably, the latter plays a major role in mediating CNS tissue damage.Interestingly, analysis of post-mortem CSF revealed the presence of significantly higher levels of CXCL13 in the MS cases with ectopic follicles and a higher frequency of CNSinfiltrating EBV-infected cells as compared to the MS cases with less brain inflammation and a lower frequency of EBVinfected cells (Fig. 1E ). This finding suggests that CXCL13 could play a key role in the compartmentalization of EBVinfected B cells within intrameningeal niches, allowing their expansion and organization in germinal center-like structures. Of interest, a recent study has shown that lymphoid chemokines (CCL19, CCL21, CXCL12 and CXCL13), in addition to their chemoattractant properties, are able to enhance the survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells, but not of normal B cells, in vitro (Ticchioni et al., 2007) . The hypothesis that lymphoid chemokines might play a role in promoting the survival of EBVinfected B cells should therefore be tested.  Concluding remarks  The work summarized in this article provides a remarkable example of how the study of lymphoid chemokines as markers of chronic inflammation in a complex neurological disease like MS has helped to direct (or redirect) the focus of neuropathological analyses on a compartment, the meninges, that has received little attention during the past decades (Guseo and Jellinger, 1975; Prineas and Wright, 1978; Lassmann et al., 2007) . Immune surveillance of the CNS routinely occurs across the meningealventricular compartment (Engelhardt and Ransohoff, 2005) and it is therefore plausible that events taking place therein play an important role in MS pathogenesis. Because the analysis of CXCL13 in the MS brain has been the starting point for the identification of intrameningeal B-cell follicles, their characterization as foci of EBV infection, and the recognition of a link between dysregulated EBV infection and inflammatory activity in MS lesions, it is fair to state that research on lymphoid chemokines has played a key role in advancing our comprehension of this complex disease. The challenge for the future is to understand how this knowledge can be exploited for therapeutic purposes.  					1			
16753342	Interfering antiviral immunity: application, subversion, hope?	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7185794/	RNA interference (RNAi), initially recognized as a natural antiviral mechanism in plants, has rapidly emerged as an invaluable tool to suppress gene expression in a sequence-specific manner in all organisms, including mammals. Its potential to inhibit the replication of a variety of viruses has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in mouse and monkey models. These results have generated profound interest in the use of this technology as a potential treatment strategy for viral infections for which vaccines and drugs are unavailable or inadequate. In this review, we discuss the progress made within the past 2–3 years towards harnessing the potential of RNAi for clinical application in viral infections and the hurdles that have yet to be overcome.	Introduction  Conventionally, only specialized cells of the immune system and their secreted products are thought to be involved in protecting the body from foreign invaders such as viruses. However, in recent years, a new type of genomic immunity mediated by RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged and has sparked intense interest as a potential treatment strategy for a variety of diseases, including viral infections, cancer and degenerative diseases [1] [2] [3] [4] . RNAi was first recognized as a naturally occurring anti-viral defense mechanism in plants. In RNAi, long double-stranded (ds) RNA generated during viral infection is cleaved by an enzyme termed Dicer into short, 21-23 nucleotide (nt) dsRNA molecules termed small interfering (si)RNAs that mediate sequence-specific gene silencing [5, 6] . The siRNA associates with a protein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (Figure 1 ), following which the sense strand is cleaved by the enzyme Argonaute 2 (Ago2) [7] . The antisense strand then guides the RISC to the corresponding messenger (m)RNA by sequence homology, and the Ago2 nuclease cuts the mRNA, resulting in specific gene silencing. In the context of RNA viruses, siRNAs can be designed to degrade not only viral mRNA but also the negative sense viral genomic RNA and the complimentary RNA that serves as a template for new genomic RNA synthesis [8] . Although RNAi is a natural phenomenon in plants and worms, long dsRNA induces an interferon response in mammalian cells resulting in non-specific global suppression of protein synthesis and cell death [9] . A landmark development in the field occurred with the discovery that the introduction of 21-nt-long synthetic RNA resembling the Dicer-processed siRNA into mammalian cells induces sequence-specific gene silencing without evoking the interferon response [10] . Since then, RNAi has been widely used as a quick reversegenetics approach for gene-function analysis and for ablating specific genes for therapeutic purposes. The exquisite sequence specificity and high potency of RNAi makes it an attractive gene-silencing approach [6] . RNAi was found to be 1000-fold more effective on a molar basis than antisense oligonucleotides [11] . This is probably owing to the autocatalytic effect of RNAi whereby a single siRNA molecule is reused for cleaving many target mRNA molecules [10, 12] . RNAi can be induced by the introduction of synthetic siRNA or by intracellular generation from vector-driven expression of precursor short hairpin (sh) RNAs (Box 1). The optimal design of siRNA or shRNA is required for the potent induction of RNAi (Box 2).  RNAi for suppressing viral infections  Although RNAi is an integral component of the innate immune response to viruses in plants, whether the same is true in mammals is unclear. However, the recently described virus-encoded counter-defense strategies, such as suppressors of RNAi and microRNAs, suggest a longstanding interaction of viruses with the RNAi machinery (Box 3). Given the natural antiviral role of RNAi in plants and its induction in mammals by introduced siRNA, the phenomenon has generated great enthusiasm as a potential antiviral treatment strategy [1, 2] . Several viruses with widely differing replication cycles have been inhibited in vitro by targeting viral and cellular genes involved in the viral life cycle ( Figure 2 ). These include: the positive-stranded RNA viruses, including polio, West Nile, dengue and foot and mouth disease (FMD) viruses; the negative-stranded RNA viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus; the doublestranded RNA rotavirus; HIV lentivirus; and DNA viruses such as the polyoma virus, papilloma virus and herpes simplex virus (HSV). However, the replicative characteristics of certain viruses can protect them from RNAi. For example, although siRNAs can inhibit progeny virus production, the genomic RNAs of RSV, hepatitis delta virus and rotavirus are resistant to RNAi owing to tight Figure 1 . RNA interference. RNA interference can be initiated in cells by the introduction of synthetic double stranded siRNA or plasmid or viral vectors encoding shRNA. The shRNA is transcribed in the nucleus and exported to the cytoplasm, where it is processed into siRNA by Dicer or, possibly, another ribonuclease. In the cytoplasm, the siRNA associates with the RISC complex consisting of several proteins, which in human cells include Dicer, argonaute 2 (Ago-2), HIV-1 transactivating response RNA-binding protein (TRBP), protein activator of protein kinase R (PACT) and, possibly, other proteins unidentified to date [50] . The sense (passenger) strand of the siRNA is then cleaved by Ago-2 within the active RISC [7] . The passenger strand can also be removed, albeit at a slower rate, by a cleavage-independent 'bypass' mechanism used for microRNA processing [7] . Because the exact sequence of the molecular interactions involved in RISC activation is unknown, the process is shown in a dotted box and the siRNA guide strand is shown as curved to indicate its directional loading into the RISC. The anti-sense (guide) strand associated with the mature RISC guides the complex to the corresponding mRNA because of sequence homology, and the same Ago-2 nuclease then cuts the target mRNA at a position corresponding to nt 10-11 from the 5 0 end of the anti-sense guide strand. The cleaved mRNA is rapidly degraded resulting in gene silencing.  Box 1. Synthetic siRNA versus vector-driven shRNA  RNAi can be induced by synthetic siRNA or by vector-driven expression of shRNA. In the second method, siRNA sequence followed by a w9nt loop and a reverse complement of the siRNA sequence is cloned in DNA or viral vectors to express endogenously the shRNA, which is processed in the cytoplasm to siRNA. Whereas synthetic siRNA is introduced into cells by transfection, shRNA can be introduced by transfection of a DNA vector or transduction through viral vectors. Non-replicating, recombinant viral vectors are commonly used for shRNA expression because of ease of delivery, particularly in difficult-to-transfect primary cells. Adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses have been used as vectors but lentiviral vectors are generally preferred because they infect actively dividing, and resting and differentiated cells such as stem cells, macrophages and neurons. Because the viral DNA is incorporated in the host genome, the main advantage of this method is the long-term expression of shRNAs and gene silencing. In fact, knockdown persisted for at least six months in the mouse brain following transduction with a shRNA-expressing vector [51] . Although viral vectors deliver shRNA efficiently, they have several disadvantages, including the vector-induced immune response and possible toxic effects of long-term RNAi induction. Moreover, retroviral integration into the host genome also enhances the risk of insertional mutagenesis, exemplified by the development of leukemia in patients undergoing retroviral-based gene therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency [49] .By contrast, synthetic siRNA, similarly to drug treatment, provides a way to achieve transient gene silencing without the risks of insertional mutagenesis, immune response induction or the toxic effects of longterm RNAi induction. The major challenge is its delivery to cells in vivo. Also, because siRNA becomes diluted by cell division, the silencing effect generally fades after 4-5 days in dividing cells. However, in non-dividing cells such as macrophages and neurons, siRNA silencing has been observed for at least 3 weeks [38, 52] .Thus, whereas siRNA seems to be ideal for situations such as acute viral infection, shRNA could be useful for treating chronic viral infections and cancer. shRNA might also be useful to generate cells resistant to infection by transducing stem cells with shRNAencoding vectors.Review TRENDS in Immunology Vol. 27 No.7 July 2006 shielding by proteins or sequestration in membranous compartments [13, 14] .Despite success in vitro, many hurdles need to be overcome before using RNAi to counteract virus infections in vivo. One major bottleneck is the delivery of siRNAs and shRNAs to appropriate cell types in vivo but significant progress has been made in the past 2-3 years. Another limitation is the lack of appropriate animal models for many human viruses. Nevertheless, studies in mice have proved invaluable for testing the in vivo efficacy for some viruses. Data obtained from these initial investigations provide a glimpse of the successes and challenges that can be expected in a clinical setting for specific viruses in terms of RNAi design and delivery. In the next subsections, we describe some of the viral diseases for which substantial progress has been made in moving RNAi towards therapy.  Viral hepatitis  Although mice are not susceptible to hepatitis viruses, transfection with plasmids containing the viral genome recapitulates many steps in the viral life cycle, including DNA replication and expression of the core and surface antigens. In one of the first demonstrations of RNAi effectiveness in vivo, McCaffrey et al. injected the pTHBV2 plasmid encoding the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome alone or with a plasmid encoding anti-HBV shRNAs by hydrodynamic intravenous injection (DNA was rapidly injected intravenously in 10-15 seconds in a large volume of O1 ml) [15] . This resulted in a substantial knockdown of HBV transcription in the liver and also resulted in O90% reduction in serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels and viral core antigen expression by liver cells. Hydrodynamic injection is not feasible in humans because it entails the injection of almost the whole blood volume. However, Morrissey et al. showed that regular low-volume intravenous injection of a chemically modified siRNA (containing a phosphorothioate backbone and 2 0fluoro and 2 0 -O-methyl substitutions to render the siRNA nuclease-resistant) can also significantly reduce serum DNA and HBsAg levels in mice [16] . Chemically modified siRNAs have also been encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles for intravenous delivery [17] . This resulted in extending the serum half-life of siRNA from w2 min to 6.5 h and reduced the siRNA amounts required for a comparable reduction in viral DNA and serum HBsAg from 30 Box 2. Recent advances in siRNA and shRNA design Until recently, the design of siRNA was based on selecting a 19-bp unique sequence with w45-55% G:C content immediately following the nucleotides AA or NA (N represents any nucleotide) within the target gene, and incorporating a 5 0 phosphate and 2-nt 3 0 overhangs [10] . The chances of making successful hits in this essentially trial-anderror process required testing multiple target sites for each gene. However, based on analyses of the biochemical properties of a large number of highly effective siRNAs, more-stringent algorithms have now been developed for predicting functional siRNAs [6] . The thermodynamic stability at the 5 0 end of the antisense strand has emerged as a crucial criterion for siRNA effectiveness [53, 54] . A low internal stability at the 5 0 end enables proper directional loading of siRNA to ensure stable incorporation of the antisense instead of the ineffective sense strand into the RISC. This increases the potency of siRNA almost a 100-fold, and, by reducing the amounts of siRNA needed for silencing, it also minimizes off-target silencing. Lower thermostability can also be ensured by incorporating mismatches in the sense strand at nucleotides complementary to positions 2-4 of the 5 0 end in the antisense strand. Because the antisense strand is still unaltered in sequence, target specificity is not compromised. Alternatively, guanosines can be replaced with inosines in the first 4 positions to give I:C base pairs that are similar in energy to A:U base pairs, to increase the propensity of this end to fray. Low thermodynamic stability in the mRNA cleavage region is also important to promote the release of the RISC-antisense complex for multiple rounds of activity. Using a 27-29 nt siRNA instead of the conventional 21-nt siRNA increases the potency by 10-100-fold without inducing an interferon response [55] . This could be because the longer siRNA is processed by Dicer to generate the optimal siRNA endogenously.The Pol III promoters, such as U6, H1 and tRNA, are commonly used to drive shRNA expression because they provide an efficient mechanism to generate small RNA transcripts. However, it has recently been shown that inserting the shRNA sequence into the backbone of a miRNA (e.g. Mir-30) at the stem increases the shRNA potency enormously, even at the level of single-copy integration [56] . Because the Pol II cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter is used to drive this longer shRNA, this system also enables multicistronic expression of multiple shRNAs.  Box. 3. Manipulation of RNAi pathways by viruses  RNAi is used as a natural antiviral defense mechanism in plants, and plant viruses have also developed mechanisms to evade RNAi [57] . Although it is unknown whether RNAi is induced naturally during viral infection in mammals, recent studies suggest that mammalian viruses can also suppress RNAi [58, 59] . Nodamura virus encodes a protein called B2 that interferes with Dicer function and the incorporation of siRNA into RISC [60] . Similarly, the E3L protein of vaccinia virus and the nonstructural protein NS1 of influenza virus can suppress RNAi by sequestering dsRNA [61, 62] . The nonstructural protein NSs of La Crosse bunyavirus and HIV-1 tat protein also suppress RNAi [63, 64] .In addition to siRNAs, another class of small RNAs called miRNAs also use the RNAi pathway [65] . In contrast to siRNAs, miRNAs are cellular gene products and regulate endogenous gene expression in plants, worms and mammals. In fact, the altered development of T and B lymphocytes has been noted in specific miRNA-knockout hematopoietic stem cells and in Dicer-knockout mice [66, 67] .Recently, viruses have also been found to encode their own miRNA and manipulate host miRNAs. Epstein-Barr virus encodes a miRNA BART2, which has been predicted to target several cellular genes [68] . Similarly, human cytomegalovirus encodes at least five miRNAs, and the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus expresses 11 miRNAs that can target host genes [69] . The exact function of these viral miRNAs has yet to be elucidated. However, the SV-40 encoded miRNA downregulates SV-40 T antigens on infected tumor cells, making them less susceptible for cytotoxic T-cell recognition, providing the virus a way to evade host immunity [70] .Viruses can also use different methods for subverting host miRNAs for their own purposes. The liver-specific miRNA miR-122 binds to the 5 0 end of the hepatitis C viral genome to greatly augment viral replication, and miR-122 inactivation abolishes viral replication [71] . By contrast, another host miRNA, miR-32, targets the retrovirus primate foamy virus-1 genome to repress viral replication, and the viral Tas protein suppresses the RNAi pathway to overcome miR-32 action [72] . A miRNA encoded within the HIV nef gene that can regulate viral transcription has also been documented [73] .Review TRENDS in Immunology Vol. 27 No.7 July 2006 to 3 mg/kg. Moreover, the reduction in serum HBV DNA could be sustained for 6 weeks simply by weekly siRNA treatment, showing the feasibility of using siRNA treatment for a chronic disease such as HBV infection.  Influenza virus  Influenza virus (IAV) is the major cause of respiratory infections worldwide. Two groups have recently used RNAi to suppress IAV infection in mice. By targeting a conserved sequence in the viral nucleoprotein and acid polymerase genes, Tompkins et al. prevented infection with multiple isolates of IAV, including the virulent avian H5N1 strain [18] . For delivery to the lungs, they injected siRNA by hydrodynamic intravenous injection combined with intranasal administration of siRNA complexed with the transfection reagent oligofectamine. Similarly, Ge et al. achieved and Polio), for which a single mRNA is used to transcribe viral proteins, targeting any part of the coding sequence should result in degradation (scissors) of viral genomic RNA and/or progeny mRNA. By contrast, for (b) viruses containing segmented RNA genomes for example, rotavirus or influenza, and for (c) DNA viruses, for example, herpes simplex or papilloma viruses, for which many different RNA molecules are used to generate viral proteins, it is necessary to target genes essential for the viral life cycle, such as the key viral enzymes or structural proteins involved in cell binding and fusion. (d) For retroviruses (e.g. HIV), although viral proteins are transcribed either from unspliced or multiple spliced viral RNAs generated from the integrated proviral DNA, the genomic RNA is linear, thus, as for (a), targeting any part of the genome should suppress viral replication. In addition to viral genes, cellular genes involved in viral replication, such as the cellular receptors or co-receptors (e.g. CD4 and CCR-5 for HIV), can also be used as RNAi targets for all viruses.

Review TRENDS in Immunology Vol.27 No.7 July 2006 efficient lung delivery following regular intravenous injection of siRNA-or shRNA-encoding DNA vector by complexing with the cationic polymer polyethyleneimine (PEI) [19] . This treatment resulted in a 1-2 log reduction in viral titers even when administered 24 h post-infection. Moreover, the intranasal administration of shRNA vector with the surfactant Infasurf R , or of siRNA complexed with PEI, were also effective, providing an intranasal approach to treat respiratory illnesses.Respiratory syncytial virus RSV is another major respiratory pathogen that causes epidemics of respiratory illness with bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Two studies have shown that siRNAs can be used effectively for prophylaxis and treatment of RSV infection. The viral nonstructural protein NS1 suppresses type I interferon production in host cells, and NS1 deletion mutants are avirulent in vitro and in vivo. Transfecting human dendritic cells with a plasmid encoding shRNA to suppress RSV NS-1 resulted in the efficient induction of interferon and interferon-induced genes following RSV infection [20] . To test its antiviral effects in vivo, the vector was complexed in a chitosan polymeric nanoparticle. Intranasal instillation of the nanoparticle was harmless in mice and substantially reduced viral titers and virusinduced pathology when administered 2 days before infection. Importantly, it also reduced lung inflammation and viral titers by nearly 2 logs even when administered 2 days after infection. Similar results were also obtained by Bitko et al. [21] . In this report, the authors used a synthetic siRNA targeting the viral P protein, an essential component of viral RNA polymerase. When administered intranasally with the TransIT R transfection reagent, the siRNA substantially suppressed virus replication and lung pathology. This effect was also seen, although to a lesser extent, when the siRNA was administered 2-3 days after viral infection. Interestingly, the intranasal application of naked siRNA without a transfection reagent was also effective (80% activity). Similarly, a siRNA targeting the P protein of parainfluenza virus was also able to suppress viral replication and virus-induced pathology [21] .  SARS corona virus  An epidemic caused by the recently emerged respiratory viral pathogen SARS corona virus (SCV) attracted worldwide attention because of the high degree of morbidity and mortality it carried. A rhesus macaque monkey model has been developed for this virus, in which intranasal instillation of the PUMC01 strain of SCV results in a disease that is similar to the human disease [22] . Li et al. used this system to test siRNA as a potential therapy for SCV [22] . siRNAs were used to target the SCV genome at the Spike protein coding region. Because the lipid-based transfection reagents PEI and TransIT TKO R used as siRNA carriers in previous studies might not be acceptable for human treatment owing to potential toxicity, the authors in this study used Infasurf R or 5% D-glucose in water (D5W) for siRNA delivery. Infasurf R (a naturally occurring lung surfactant protein) and D5W are nontoxic and are currently in clinical use. D5W was 3-4 fold more effective than Infasurf R in delivering siRNA to the lungs. For testing the efficacy in monkeys, 10 mg/kg of siRNA was intranasally instilled in 3 ml of D5W solution. This treatment substantially reduced clinical symptoms, lung pathology and viral burden. Although the inhibitory effect was maximal when the siRNA was administered 4h before or with viral challenge, disease mitigation was seen even when it was given 24h after viral challenge. Thus, this study demonstrated for the first time the considerable antiviral potential of RNAi in a non-human primate model using clinically acceptable carriers for siRNA delivery.Herpes simplex virus siRNA has also been used as a potential topical microbiocide [23] . Intravaginal application of an anti-greenfluorescent-protein (GFP) siRNA mixed with oligofectamine in GFP-transgenic mice resulted in the loss of GFP expression throughout the vagina and cervix but not in distant organs, such as the liver. Importantly, the topical application of siRNAs targeting the essential HSV-2 genes UL27 (envelope glycoprotein B) and UL29 (a DNA-binding protein) before viral infection reduced mortality by 60% and substantially reduced viral shedding from the vagina. Combinations of siRNAs were also effective when administered 3 and 6 h after infection. This study highlights the feasibility of using a similar approach for other sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV-1.  Encephalitogenic flaviviruses  Japanese encephalitis (JE) and West Nile (WN) viruses can cause a devastating neurological illness. Two studies have used RNAi to suppress these viruses in mouse models. Bai et al. injected a siRNA targeting the viral envelope gene hydrodynamically 24h before an intraperitoneal WNV challenge and observed a 40% increase in survival [24] . Kumar et al. targeted conserved regions in the viral envelope genes of JEV and WNV and administered siRNA through a lentiviral vector or as synthetic siRNA complexed with the cationic lipid JetSI/Dope to enable siRNA delivery to neuronal cells [25] . A single intracranial treatment with lentiviral vector or synthetic siRNA was sufficient to provide almost complete protection from fatality. siRNA treatment given 18 h after infection was also effective but the treatment failed at later time points. Significantly, by targeting a sequence that is highly conserved in JEV and WNV, they achieved near-complete protection against fatal encephalitis induced by either JEV or WNV. This offers the possibility of using siRNA as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent to suppress related viruses across species.Foot and mouth disease FMD is a highly contagious and economically devastating disease of domestic animals. Chen et al. used a plasmid vector encoding a shRNA targeting the viral VP-1 gene in a suckling mouse model [26] . The subcutaneous injection of 50 mg of plasmid DNA 6h before FMD challenge resulted in 75% survival, compared with 100% mortality in control-DNA-injected mice. However, DNA vector injection at the time of viral challenge or increasing the challenge virus dose reduced the protection considerably. HIV Interest in RNAi as an alternative antiviral approach has been particularly strong for HIV-1 because of the problems of drug resistance, toxicity and the cost of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Several investigators have used RNAi to suppress HIV in cell lines and primary cells [27] [28] [29] . However, given the specificity of RNAi, the propensity of the virus to mutate can pose a serious challenge for therapeutic use. In vitro studies have documented the generation of RNAi-escape mutants in long-term cultures [30, 31] . Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that although the homology requirement for RNAi is stringent for the crucial central residues, there is some tolerance for peripheral nucleotide changes [32] . Moreover, because RNAi requires only short stretches of homology, it is possible to target one or more regions which are highly conserved because of their essential structural and functional roles. Several of these conserved target sites have been identified [33] [34] [35] [36] . By targeting a highly conserved vif sequence, Lee et al. protected CD4 T cells from all HIV clades, including multiple isolates of clade B, which is prevalent in the West [33] .Host genes important for HIV replication, including the viral receptor CD4 and the co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4, have also been targeted to avoid viral escape. Synthetic and lentivirally-expressed siRNAs have been used to prevent HIV entry by silencing CCR5 [37, 38] . CCR5 is the favored target because a 32 base pair (bp) deletion of the gene is known to be harmless and confers resistance to HIV infection [39] . Using a combination of siRNAs targeting conserved viral sequences and host genes important in the viral life cycle might be the optimal therapeutic approach, akin to antiretroviral drug cocktails. In another study, RNAi has been combined with other gene therapy approaches in a single lentiviral vector. The lentivirus was engineered to encode a shRNA targeting HIV-1 rev/tat mRNA, a short RNA homologous to the viral transactivation response region (TAR) to act as a decoy for TAT binding, and a ribozyme targeting the host CCR5 gene. The approach might be a pragmatic way for achieving the stable long-term suppression of HIV replication because each of these therapeutic RNAs targets a different gene product and blocks HIV replication by a distinct mechanism [40] .A novel approach has also been used for targeted siRNA delivery to infected T cells. Here, a chimeric recombinant protein consisting of a single-chain antibody to HIV-1 gp120 fused to the highly positively charged protamine was able to bind to siRNA (by charge interaction) and deliver it specifically to HIV-infected CD4 C T cells [41] . Moreover, when administered with bound anti-tumor siRNAs, it specifically targeted and cleared gp120expressing experimental tumors in mice.Another approach is to generate HIV-resistant progeny T cells and macrophages by transducing hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). The feasibility of this approach was shown in the severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse-human chimeric model by transplanting human CD34 C hematopoietic stem cells transduced with a lentivirus expressing an anti-HIV shRNA [42, 43] .  Potential limitations of RNAi therapy  RNAi has already entered Phase I clinical trials for macular degeneration and RSV infection. However, there are several hurdles that must be overcome for routine therapeutic use. A significant limitation for its use in viral infections is the natural sequence differences that exist amongst the various serotypes and strains within a given viral species. Sequence divergence can also occur because of the accumulation of mutations during viral replication or the active generation of escape mutants [2] . Selecting conserved sequences where the virus is averse to mutate and using a combination of several viral and feasible cellular targets could overcome this limitation. Even so, target sequences based on the data available for the few sequenced viruses might not ensure effectiveness against field strains of virus. Thus, testing multiple field isolates in vivo might be necessary.Although substantial progress has been made, more studies are required to achieve the effective and nontoxic delivery of siRNA and shRNA in vivo. Toxicity can be a problem for in vivo use, particularly when carriers such as transfection reagents are used for delivery. For example, although PEI has been used in one study in mice [19] , several reports suggest that it induces toxic effects that might result in the death of the animals [21, 22, 44] . Thus, greater emphasis should be given to developing clinically acceptable carriers for systemic delivery. The encasement of siRNA within nontoxic nanoparticles or liposomes might enhance stability and simultaneously avoid toxicity. Combining a targeted delivery approach, using antibodies or receptor ligands, the introduction of chemical modifications in the siRNA, and the encasement of siRNA within nanoparticles or liposomes could be the ideal way to improve systemic delivery and reduce siRNA requirements. Delivery to the brain is still a challenge because of the blood-brain barrier. However, a recent study used transferrin receptor antibody-coated immunoliposomes to overcome this barrier [45] .Another issue is the induction of interferon and the associated inflammatory effects. In fact, toll-like receptor (TLR) recognition of RNA by plasmacytoid dendritic cells seems to be a major mechanism of interferon induction [46] , and the administration of naked siRNA might induce interferon. However, certain motifs within the RNA seem to be crucial for interferon induction; avoiding such motifs or encapsulating siRNA within nanoparticles could reduce this risk [17, 47] . A better understanding of the immunostimulatory motifs within the RNA that are needed for TLR activation might help to avoid non-specific immune activation. However, because most viral infections induce interferon and inflammation, this might not be a major limitation for antiviral therapy. The inadvertent targeting of host genes, observed in some in vitro studies [48] , is another issue that needs more-thorough investigation. Although no grossly observable side effects have been reported in vivo, off-target effects might not necessarily manifest as symptoms in animals but could be unacceptable for human therapy. Also, because the RNAi machinery is used in mammalian cells to regulate cellular gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs), the effect of the exogenously introduced siRNA on miRNA functioning Review should be investigated. Another concern is the effect of possible subversion of the RNAi machinery by viral proteins or virally encoded microRNAs (Box 3).Safety is an also an issue in using shRNA delivery through viral vectors because of the possibility of insertional mutagenesis and malignant transformation [49] . Another concern is that the effect of long-term siRNA induction is unknown. Inducible systems for the controlled expression of siRNA from plasmid or viral vectors could offer hope in this regard.  Summary  RNAi has tremendous therapeutic potential in viral infections. The major hurdles of delivery to the appropriate cells necessary for its in vivo use as a therapeutic agent are being rapidly overcome and siRNA therapy is already being tested in clinical trials. Future studies should undoubtedly focus on further refining in vivo delivery methods, and minimizing off-target effects and the emergence of escape mutants in vivo. Optimizing siRNA design, delivery methods and delivery schedules to achieve sustained siRNA levels in the target cells should be emphasized. With these investigations and further advancement in the understanding of the endogenous RNAi mechanism, the next few years should prove to be an exciting time to discover whether RNAi will become a viable approach to treat viral infections in humans, particularly after the appearance of clinical symptoms.  			1		1			
27339249	Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug without Antibiotics for Acute Viral Infection Increases the Empyema Risk in Children: A Matched Case-Control Study	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094675/	Objective To investigate the risk factors of empyema after acute viral infection and to clarify the hypothesized association(s) between empyema and some viruses and/or the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Study design A case-control study was conducted in 15 centers. Cases and controls were enrolled for a source population of children 3-15 years of age with acute viral infections between 2006 and 2009. Results Among 215 empyemas, 83 cases (children with empyema and acute viral infection within the 15 preceding days) were included, and 83 controls (children with acute viral infection) were matched to cases. Considering the intake of any drug within 72 hours after acute viral infection onset and at least 6 consecutive days of antibiotic use and at least 1 day of NSAIDs exposure, the multivariable analysis retained an increased risk of empyema associated with NSAIDs exposure (aOR 2.79, 95% CI 1.4-5.58, P = .004), and a decreased risk associated with antibiotic use (aOR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11-0.97, P = .04). The risk of empyema associated with NSAIDs exposure was greater for children not prescribed an antibiotic and antibiotic intake diminished that risk for children given NSAIDs. Conclusions NSAIDs use during acute viral infection is associated with an increased risk of empyema in children, and antibiotics are associated with a decreased risk. The presence of antibiotic-NSAIDs interaction with this risk is suggested. These findings suggest that NSAIDs should not be recommended as a first-line antipyretic treatment during acute viral infections in children.	  A lthough relatively infrequent, empyema is a serious bacterial infection of the pleural space that remains a cause of substantial morbidity, with an in-hospital case-fatality ratio of 0.4% for children. 1 Late diagnosis and onset of appropriate therapy contribute to increased morbidity. In addition, the in-hospital management of patients with empyema is associated with substantial economic costs. 2 In the 2000s, the incidence rate of empyema in children increased worldwide as in France without clear explanations. 1,3-6 This trend was not modified by 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) programs, 1,3-7 but hospitalizations for uncomplicated pneumonia clearly declined thereafter. 8 Previous retrospective studies suggested that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during community-acquired pneumonia may be associated with an increased risk of empyema, 3,9-13 but a protopathic bias could not be excluded. This case-control study was undertaken to investigate children's risk factors for empyema after acute viral infection and determine whether some viruses, 14, 15 use of NSAIDs, or both were associated.  Methods  The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of University Hospital Necker-Enfants Malades (CCP06-03-09). All participating parents and case and control children older than 7 years of age were given oral and written information and provided written consent.This matched case-control study included cases and controls from a source population of children with acute viral infections and was conducted in 15 French pediatric respiratory clinical departments from September 2006 to June 2009. Acute viral infection was diagnosed by clinical symptoms by the provider. The following acute viral infections were as follows: herpes virus infection; varicella; gastroenteritis, defined as acute diarrhea, with at least 3 loose stools per day; nasopharyngitis, defined as runny nose, nasal congestion, and cough; bronchiolitis, defined as cough, shortness of breath, and wheeze at auscultation; flu-like syndrome, defined as cough with fever and myalgia; bronchitis, defined as cough and bronchial congestion; and viral pharyngitis documented by a negative test for rapid diagnosis of group A streptococcal infection. Acute viral infections were divided into 3 groups: upper respiratory tract viral infections, lower respiratory tract viral infections (LRTVIs) (bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and flu), and others. All acute viral infections were not severe and did not require hospitalization.Consecutive patients 3 months to 15 years of age who were hospitalized for empyema in 1 of the 15 participating centers were eligible. Empyema was defined as the presence of a pleural effusion on chest radiograph and at least 1 of the following results of tests on pleural fluid: pH < 7.2, lactate dehydrogenase >1000 IU/L, glucose <2.2 mmol/L, protein >3000 mg/dL, white blood cell count >50 000 cells/mL, 16 and/or a positive bacterial culture or Gram stain. To be a case, the empyema had to follow doctor-diagnosed acute viral infection based on clinical symptoms and identified within a maximum of 15 days preceding the date of the first pleural puncture.Controls were children 3 months to 15 years of age with acute viral infections from the same "source population" as case children, which was defined as children evaluated by the same private practitioner for acute viral infections. Controls were recruited as follows: upon case identification, the doctor who referred the child to the hospital was contacted to identify, among his/her patients, children matched for age (+/À1 year) who consulted for same viral symptoms during the 15 preceding days with the similar time window as the matched case ( Figure 1 ; available at www.jpeds.com).Exclusion criteria for cases and controls were chronic respiratory disease, acquired and/or congenital immunological disorders, malignancy, collagen vascular disease, sickle cell disease, congenital heart defects, neuromuscular disease, hemophilia, and/or heart failure; treatment with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents during the month preceding identification; and known intolerance of NSAIDs or acetaminophen.Exclusion criteria for cases were absence of at least 24 hours of apyrexia between recovering from LRTVI symptoms and a diagnosis of empyema and time between onset of acute viral infection and a diagnosis of empyema <72 hours (to decrease the possibility that symptom onset was possible onset of the bacterial infection).For each hospital case, after questioning the parents, a trained doctor or nurse completed a detailed and standardized form, recording symptoms, treatment concerning the period between onset of acute viral infection (first day of clinical symptom), and empyema diagnosis by pleural puncture, corresponding to the time of exposure. For the controls, the parents were contacted after the consultation with the treating physician and data recorded retrospectively exactly as done for the cases, with the same detailed and standardized form, recording clinical items concerning the same exposure window-timing from the acute viral infection onset as the matched case. Primary providers went at controls' home to obtain nasal swab specimen and record data ( Figure 1) . Symptoms, treatments (antibiotics, glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, acetaminophen) according to the doctors' prescriptions, and self-administered medications were recorded daily. The following information also was recorded for all enrolled children: demographics, immunization status, and type of acute viral infection as stated by the doctors. In addition, a nasal swab was obtained for respiratory virus screening.For the cases, initial clinical findings, results of biochemistry and microbiology tests, radiograph findings, management, and length of stay were recorded. Two doctors reviewed the medical records of all identified patients and independently validated each case.  Microbiology  After identification in the laboratory of the hospital at which the case was admitted, bacterial strains from pleural fluids were sent for identity confirmation to the University Hospital Necker-Enfants Malades microbiology laboratory as, when feasible, a sample of pleural fluid was sent for pneumococcal antigen testing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae). When cultures were negative, pneumococcal and universal bacterial PCRs were performed. DNA was extracted from 100 mL of pleural fluid samples previously stored at À80 C with the automated MagNA Pure LC System (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) and eluted in 100 mL of elution buffer using the DNA III Magna Pure DNA Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics). In-house C pneumoniae (OMP1 gene) and M pneumoniae (P1 cytadhesin gene) PCRs were performed as described previously. 17, 18 S pneumoniae pneumolysin gene real-time PCR was performed according to Corless et al. 19 For negative pneumococcal PCR samples, real-time amplification of universal bacterial 16S rDNA was performed and the amplified product was sequenced, as previously reported. 20 Pneumococcal antigen was detected with the immunochromatographic test BinaxNOW for Streptococcus pneumoniae (Binax Inc, Portland, Maine), according to Le Monnier et al. 21 Pneumococcal strains were serotyped at the French National Reference Center for Pneumococci (NRCP) via the use of latex particles coated with a complete panel of antisera and factor serum (provided by the Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark), which is able to identify the 91 known serotypes. Pneumococcal strains of known serotypes from the Statens Serum Institute and from French NRCP were used as internal controls. When available, DNA from individual pleural fluid samples with positive pneumolysin PCRs also were sent to the NRCP for serotyping with conventional multiplex PCR. PCR and PCR-products detection on 2% agarose gels were performed as described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/pcr.htm).Nasal swabs were deposited in 1.5 mL of transport medium containing 29.5 g of tryptose phosphate broth (Becton Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France), 5.0 g of gelatin (Becton Dickinson), 50 000 units of penicillin, 50 mg of streptomycin, and 12.5 mg amphotericin B (Antibiotic antimycotic solution; Sigma, Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France). Viral RNA or DNA was isolated with the automated MagNA Pure LC System (Roche Diagnostics) from 200 mL of nasal samples and eluted in 100 mL of elution buffer via the Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics).In-house, real-time PCRs were used to detect adenoviruses, as previously described, 22 and in-house, 1-step, real-time reverse transcripted PCRs were used to detect metapneumovirus, influenza virus A and B, parainfluenza viruses (1, 2, and 3), respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, and rhinovirus, as reported elsewhere. 23   Statistical Analyses  The analysis phase considered drug exposure from the onset of acute viral infection symptoms. Drug use was considered when exposure began within the 72 hours after the onset of acute viral infection and before apyrexia for LRTVIs. For each control, the period of time at risk for drug exposure was defined as the time between onset of acute viral infection and empyema diagnosis for the paired case. Drug exposuredurations considered were of at least 3 or 6 consecutive days for antibiotics and 1, 2, or 3 consecutive days for NSAIDs and acetaminophen. Conditional logistic regression was used to compare cases and matched controls for general characteristics. All variables achieving P # .20 were included in the multivariable analysis. Estimated matched ORs for proposed exposure definitions used the same P-value threshold. The final model was determined via a manual backwardselection procedure. When appropriate, interactions between variables were tested. More specifically, we used subgroup modeling to thoroughly investigate interactions between final significant variables. When the conditional logistic model did not converge, unpaired classical logistic regression was used. In that case, compared with conditional logistic model, greater significance might be observed. A 2-tailed P < .05 in the multivariable model defined significance. All computations were made with Stata v10.0 software (Stata-Corp, College Station, Texas).  Results  Of 215 potential cases and 94 potential controls, 83 matched pairs of eligible cases and controls were identified (Figure 2 ; available at www.jpeds.com). In each group, 53.0% were boys. Mean duration of exposure defined as delay between onset of acute viral infection and diagnosis of empyema in cases was 10 days. No significant differences were observed between cases and controls for age, siblings, parents' occupations, the acute viral infection site, PVC-7 vaccination, and fever at the acute viral infection onset ( Table I) . Acute viral infections were mostly upper respiratory tract viral infections. More than one-half of the subjects in each group had received at least 1 PCV-7 dose. For children with respiratory viral identification, no differences were found between the types of viruses identified for cases and controls ( Table II ; available at www.jpeds.com). Among the 79 cases with identified bacteria, S pneumoniae accounted for 86% ( Figure 3 ; available at www.jpeds.com). Among S pneumoniae with an identified serotype (n = 32), serotypes 1, 19A, and 3 were the most frequent, with the vast majority (31/32) belonging to non-PCV-7 vaccine serotypes ( Figure 4 ; available at www.jpeds.com).Considering the drug exposure-duration (6 days for antibiotics and 1or 3 consecutive days for NSAIDs) and the interval between onset of acute viral infection and starting treatment of 72 hours for any drug, NSAIDs were systematically used more often and antibiotics systematically less often for cases than controls. Acetaminophen also was prescribed more frequently for cases than controls, particularly when taken for at least 3 consecutive days (Table III) .Considering drug-use onset within 72 hours after the onset of acute viral infection and at least 6 consecutive days of antibiotic use and at least 1 day of NSAIDs or antipyretic exposure, the multivariable analysis retained increased risk of empyema associated with NSAID exposure (aOR 2.79, P = .004), decreased risk of empyema associated with antibiotic (aOR 0.32, P = .04) ( Table IV) , and no association with acetaminophen. No interaction between antibiotic use and NSAIDs exposure was statistically significant in the link with empyema (P = .23). Subgroup analyses carried out to examine potential interaction(s) between antibiotic and NSAID use and empyema showed that the risk of empyema associated with NSAID was greater when antibiotics were used for less than 6 consecutive days (unconditional aOR 3.01, P = .002), and empyema risk associated with antibiotics was lower for the subgroup of children exposed to NSAIDs (unconditional aOR 0.24, P = .06) compared with children unexposed to NSAIDS (Table V ; available at www.jpeds.com).  Discussion  This case-control study provided strong support for an increased risk of empyema for children with acute viral infections exposed to NSAIDs. NSAIDs previously have been a suspected risk factor for severe bacterial infections. The biological mechanisms of how NSAID can influence the pathogenesis of bacterial infections remain controversial. Based on the ability of NSAIDS to modify the host's inflammatory pathway and innate immune response, a direct role for NSAIDs in development of severe group A streptococcal infection was proposed by Stevens in 1995. 24 This hypothesis was based on the ability of NSAIDS to induce increased production of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1, and interleukin 6.It has been observed that NSAIDs may have an inhibitory action of leukocyte adhesion, phagocytosis, and bactericidal activity in vitro. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Finally, it was observed that low concentrations of ibuprofen, such as those obtained during antipyretic use, may have a proinflammatory action that promotes the recruitment and influx of neutrophils. 30 The use of NSAIDs also reflects delayed effective treatment, because NSAIDs might mask the onset of bacterial disease by decreasing the inflammatory response to infection. Associations between bacterial infections and NSAIDs were reported for necrotizing fasciitis during primary varicella 31, 32 or for invasive group A streptococcal infection. 33 The occurrence of new symptoms or complications were slightly more frequent in children receiving ibuprofen than in those advised to take acetaminophen during respiratory tract infections. 34 Empyema was thought to be associated with outpatient use of NSAIDs in children and adults 3, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] ; however, NSAIDs could not be causally implicated. These analysis were hampered by protopathic bias, 35 ie, the possibility of more frequent use of NSAIDs because patients who developed empyema had more febrile (severe) early infection than those with uncomplicated acute bacterial pneumonia. It was impossible to clearly state whether NSAIDs had been started before or after empyema onset. The strength of our case-control study is that it was specifically designed to minimize this bias as much as possible. First, paired case and control were from the same source population. Children with initial acute viral infection that could lead to antipyretic exposure were diagnosed by the same physician. Because controls were recruited by the same doctor, physician-related and geographic variations of exposure were controlled. Second, for LRTVIs, to avoid protopathic bias as much as possible, children without at least 24 hours of apyrexia between recovery from LRTVI symptoms and a diagnosis of empyema were excluded. Third, when the time between onset of acute viral infection and diagnosis of empyema was less than 72 hours, children were excluded to avoid drug exposure for pyrexia and/or pain linked with empyema onset. Fourth, the analysis phase considered drug exposure only when first drug intake occurred within 72 hours after the onset of acute viral infection symptoms. The increased risk of empyema associated with NSAID intake during acute viral infection is our primary observation; the fact that the association is significant as of the first day of NSAID use strengthens our results.Some study limitations are noteworthy. The relatively small numbers of cases and controls limit the statistical po-wer to identify associations. It was relatively difficult to find matched controls despite the efforts of primary providers. In addition, the daily dosage of medicine taken was not precise enough to permit analysis for a dose effect.The diminished risk of empyema associated with antibiotic treatment of acute viral infection is our second important observation. The reduced risk of pneumonia after antibiotic treatment for LRTVIs has been reported previously. 36 Antibiotics slightly diminished the risk of suppurative complications of acute sore throat in adults 37 and of mastoiditis after otitis in children. 38 In our study, antibiotic exposure reached significance only when therapy was given for at least 6 days. The physician's indication to prescribe antibiotics was not known. Acetaminophen had no impact on empyema.The lack of finding a significant interaction between antibiotics plus NSAIDs and empyema likely was related to lack of power because of small numbers of subjects. Still, the risk of empyema associated with NSAID exposure was greater for children not prescribed an antibiotic, and antibiotic intake reduced the risk for children given NSAIDs. NSAIDs recommended as antipyretics are used widely during acute viral infections in children and also have been sold over-the-counter for many years. NSAIDS constitute one of the most widely used classes of drugs, with probably several million prescriptions and several billion over-the-counter tablets sold for children as antipyretics in developed countries. Regardless of the efficacies of these drugs to control fever, our results suggest that their use is associated with complicated bacterial infection associated with acute viral infection and should be reconsidered.Acute viral infection itself likely enhances the risk of bacterial infection and may vary by virus and syndrome. 12, 39 To reduce this bias, cases and controls were matched for initial viral syndrome. Moreover, virus detection rates and viruses identified were very similar for cases and controls, suggesting that viral species causing the acute viral infection did not influence the complication of empyema.Increased incidence of empyema has been reported in many countries, and some authors have suggested this phenomenon is caused by the dissemination of a particular pathogenic S pneumoniae. In our study, pathogens associated with empyema were S pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Our findings strongly argue against an oligoclonal or monoclonal phenomenon. The S pneumoniae serotype diversity (mostly non-PCV-7 serotypes) in our patients was similar to that observed for empyema 1, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] and for other invasive S pneumoniae infections in France, 40 and no dominant serotype was observed.Our results strongly support the idea that NSAIDs increase risk of empyema in children with previous acute viral infection and suggest that NSAIDs interact with antibiotics. These findings suggest that NSAIDs should not be recommended as a first-line antipyretic treatment during acute viral infections in children. n We thank the study's Scientific Advisory Board that provided useful advice: Lucien Abenhaim (previously employed by Paris Descartes   			1					
28159152	Epidemiology of Viral Pneumonia	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115731/	The burden of pneumonia, including that due to respiratory viruses, is markedly higher in the very young (<5 years) and older adults (≥50 years). Respiratory viruses substantially contribute to pneumonia in both adults and children, and when systematically tested for, are more commonly detected than bacteria in both adults and children. It is difficult to distinguish between viruses by clinical presentation, and the exact clinical implication of viral detections among patients with pneumonia depends on the pathogen detected; however, there is increasing evidence of their importance in pneumonia.	INTRODUCTION  Worldwide, 900,000 children aged less than 5 years die from pneumonia every year. 1 Pneumonia is a leading infectious cause of hospitalization and death among US adults, resulting in more than $10 billion annual expenses. 2 Despite advances in clinical diagnostic methods, especially molecular-based methods, a cause is not always ascertained in a patient with pneumonia. Recent prospective pneumonia etiology studies have failed to detect a pathogen in greater than 50% of adults and approximately 20% of children hospitalized with pneumonia. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] In these same studies, viruses were more commonly detected than bacteria in both adults and children, accounting for greater than 25% of detections in adults and greater than 70% in children. 3, 7 The exact implications of viral detections among patients with pneumonia depend on the pathogen detected, but there is increasing evidence of their importance in pneumonia. 8   US PREVALENCE/INCIDENCE  The Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) study was a large prospective multicenter US population-based active surveillance study in which viruses were more commonly detected than bacteria in both adults and children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia when systematic testing was used. 3, 7 Detailed study details have been previously described, 3, 7 but in brief, community-acquired pneumonia was defined as evidence of acute infection, acute respiratory illness, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia; patients with severe immunosuppression and recent hospitalization were excluded. Multiple modalities for pathogen detection of bacteria and viruses were used, including culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), serology, and antigen-based diagnostic assays. 3, 7 The results of the EPIC study demonstrated that prevalence and incidence of different pathogens varied by age. Among children less than 18 years old enrolled in the EPIC study, 70% of pneumonia hospitalizations occurred among children less than 5 years old. 7 Overall annual incidence of community-acquired pneumonia hospitalization in children was 15.7/10,000 children, and incidence was highest in children less than 2 years old (62.2/10,000 children), decreased in children 2 to 4 years old (23.8/10,000) , and further decreased with increasing age. These rates were slightly lower than the 2009 national Kids' Inpatient Database, which reported 22.4 hospitalized pneumonia cases per 10,000 children less than 18 years old. 9 There are methodologic differences that likely explain these differences, including nonoverlapping years of analysis, distinctions between the populations studied, and varying case definitions, including exclusion of the severely immunocompromised in the EPIC study. Nonetheless, there were similar trends indicating that pneumonia burden is highest among the youngest children.In the EPIC study, among 2222 children with clinical and radiographic pneumonia who had specimens available for bacterial and viral diagnostic testing, a pathogen was detected in 1802 (81%) children with one or more viruses in 1472 (66%), bacteria in 175 (8%), and both bacteria and viruses in 155 (7%). Among these 2222 children, the most commonly detected viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 28%), human rhinoviruses (HRV, 27%), human metapneumovirus (HMPV, 13%), adenoviruses (AdV, 11%), parainfluenza 1 to 3 viruses (PIV, 7%), influenza A and B viruses (7%), and coronaviruses (CoV, 5%) (Fig. 1B , codetections are indicated by the lighter shading). 7 Compared with older children, RSV, AdV, and HMPV were all more commonly detected among children less than 5 years old (Fig. 1C) . The incidence of RSV, HRV, HMPV, AdV, influenza viruses, PIV, and CoV was all higher among children less than 5 years old than among older children but was highest among children less than 2 years old. 7 In adults enrolled in the EPIC study, overall annual incidence of community-acquired pneumonia hospitalization was 24.8/10,000 adults. 3 The overall and pathogen-specific incidences increased with age with rates highest among adults 50 years of age and older. The EPIC study rates and trends are similar to previous pneumonia etiology studies conducted in the 1990s despite methodologic differences, 10 but the EPIC study hospitalization rates were lower than more recent estimates based on hospitalization claims data likely due to certain excluded groups in the EPIC study, including those with severe immunosuppression. 11 Among the 2259 adults enrolled in the EPIC study with clinical and radiographic pneumonia who had specimens available for bacterial and viral diagnostic testing, a pathogen was detected in 853 (38%) with one or more viruses in 530 (23%), bacteria in 247 (11%), bacteria and viruses in 59 (3%), and a fungal or mycobacterial pathogen in 17 (1%). Among the 2259 adults, the most commonly detected viruses were HRV (9%), influenza A and B viruses (6%), HMPV (4%), RSV (3%), PIV (2%), CoV (2%), and AdV (1%) (Fig. 1A) . 3 Importantly, the incidence of pneumonia hospitalization with influenza was almost 5 times higher among adults 65 years and older than among younger adults, and the incidence of HRV was almost 10 times as high. Interestingly, the overall incidence of pneumonia hospitalization with influenza (1.5/10,000) was similar to that of pneumococcus (1.2/10,000), a well-known bacterial cause of communityacquired pneumonia.  WORLDWIDE/REGIONAL PREVALENCE, INCIDENCE, AND MORTALITIES  It is well known that respiratory viruses contribute to acute respiratory infections, including those involving the lower respiratory tract and leading to bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and other complications. Although some global estimates of respiratory virus burden have been derived, including some from low-and middle-income countries, these data remain sparse because little surveillance for respiratory viruses is systematically carried out in many countries. In addition, most surveillance and thus estimates are not specific to pneumonia, and definitions of pneumonia vary widely between studies, making comparisons difficult.In a 2005 study, RSV was associated with 22% of acute lower respiratory infections in children less than 5 years old worldwide with 3.4 (2.8-4.3) million hospitalizations and 66,000 to 199,000 deaths; 99% of deaths occurred in developing countries. 12 Data from this same analysis demonstrated that most RSV deaths in high-income countries were in children less than 1 year old, whereas in low-and middle-income countries, these deaths extended into the second year of life.Similar analyses have been done for the burden of influenza virus infection, again not necessarily limited to pneumonia. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), influenza occurs globally with an annual attack rate estimated at 5% to 10% in adults and 20% to 30% in children. 13 Worldwide, these annual epidemics are estimated to result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths. Although hospitalizations and deaths occur in healthy people, certain groups are at higher risk for complications, and thus, influenza vaccines are targeted for these high-risk groups, including children 6 months to 5 years old, elderly 65 years and older, people with chronic medical conditions, pregnant women, and health care workers.As part of the Pneumonia Research for Child Health (PERCH) project, 7 low-and middleincome countries have conducted research on pneumonia etiology among children less than 5 years old. In the PERCH project, the pneumonia case-definition per the WHO definitions was of severe (lower chest-wall indrawing in a child with history of cough or difficulty breathing) or very severe (cyanosis, oxygen saturation <90%, inability to feed, head nodding, or impaired consciousness in a child with history of cough or difficulty in breathing) pneumonia. Two types of outpatient controls without pneumonia included asymptomatic children and children with upper respiratory tract infection. In a preliminary analysis from one study site in rural Kenya, respiratory viruses were detected in most (60%) children less than 5 years old with pneumonia but also in controls (47%). 14 Of the viruses detected, RSV was the most commonly detected virus in case-patients but not controls with a statistically significant association between virus detection and pneumonia hospitalization. 14 In other pneumonia studies conducted in high-, low-, and middle-income countries, although the prevalence of specific viruses varies greatly, viruses are more commonly detected than bacteria, particularly in children. Prevalence of viruses can vary by geography and other factors, such as immunization coverage, as well as study design, including case definitions, specimen collection methods, and diagnostic tools applied; however, in most of these studies, certain viruses predominate, including RSV but also HMPV, AdV, and PIV. In a study of severe and very severe pneumonia conducted in Kenya and using multiplex PCR, a virus was detected in 56% of children less than 12 years old; RSV was most common and detected in 34% of children. 15 In a different study conducted in Mozambique, viruses were detected in 49% of children with severe pneumonia, and in this case, HRV (41%), AdV (21%), and RSV (11%) were the most common. 16 In similar studies, HMPV, AdV, PIV, and CoV combined account for 25% to 40% of pathogens detected in children when using PCR methods. 17, 18 In many studies, codetections (viral and bacterial) in children with pneumonia have been demonstrated in more than one-quarter of cases. 7, 14, 19 The role of viruses in adults has had increasing attention because viruses like RSV and HMPV have been commonly detected in systematic studies of hospitalized adults. 20, 21 Although the same viruses that circulate in children also affect adults, the prevalence of the viruses differs between children and adults with pneumonia and also compared with data from controls. For example, HRV has been commonly detected in adult pneumonia patients, including from sterile lower respiratory tract specimens; in contrast with children, HRV is not commonly detected among adult asymptomatic controls and is often detected as the sole pathogen in adults, whereas, in children, it is often codetected. 3, 4, 8, [22] [23] [24] [25] Influenza viruses are a known contributor to viral pneumonia, 25 as well as a precursor to bacterial pneumonia, and are a common cause of pneumonia among persons 65 years and older. The range of other virus detections, including HMPV, RSV, PIV, CoV, and AdV, in adults with pneumonia is broad, ranging from 11% to 28% depending on the study location, design, and diagnostic tools. 4, 5, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Bacterial or viral codetections are less frequently detected in adults than in children. 3   WORLDWIDE/REGIONAL SEASONALITY AND CIRCULATION PATTERNS  The circulation of respiratory viruses varies from region to region around the world and demonstrates seasonal variation in different parts of the world, which affects the prevalence and incidence of viral pneumonia globally. In the United States, similar to other Northern Hemisphere countries, there are distinct peaks and troughs for different viruses. Generally, except for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic period from 2008 to 2009, there have been very clear peaks of influenza virus circulation annually in the United States that occur in the late fall or early winter, although it is never predictable exactly when the influenza season will start, and there is also regional variation. US influenza virus circulation data are reported weekly at the national and regional level on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) FluView Web site: http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivitysurv.htm. Similarly, influenza circulation varies worldwide and surveillance methods vary from nation to nation, but data on global influenza circulation can be accessed on the WHO FluNet Web site: http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/ flunet/en/. Weekly global update reports are also available here: http://www.who.int/influenza/ surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_ GIP_surveillance/en/.In the United States, RSV circulation usually starts in late October and lasts until late January but can shift, starting in late January and lasting until early April depending on the year and circulation of other respiratory pathogens. Like influenza viruses, there is also regional variation with an earlier season starting in Florida and lasting longer than other US regions. National and regional RSV surveillance trends can be monitored at the CDC National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) Web site: http:// www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/rsv/natl-trend. html. Through NREVSS, national and regional data are available for HMPV (http://www.cdc.gov/ surveillance/nrevss/hmpv/natl-trend.html) and national data are also available for AdV (http://www. cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/adeno/natl-trend.html) and PIV (http://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/ human-paraflu/natl-trend.html), although specimens are not routinely tested for these viruses. Globally, RSV surveillance efforts and methods vary from country to country. Data from 7 countries (Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Guatemala, Kenya, South Africa, and Thailand) over 8 years (2004-2012) demonstrated that RSV infection had 1 to 2 epidemic periods each year in each country; in general, seasonality patterns were similar within country but differed between countries from year to year. Likely factors affecting circulation were weather, geography, precipitation, and temperature. 29 Similar reports from tropical and subtropical areas of southern and southeastern Asia have also shown that influenza virus circulation is highly dependent on weather patterns, especially rainfall and monsoons, and affects the seasonality of influenza virus circulation regionally, which has direct implications for influenza vaccination timing in these regions. 30, 31   CLINICAL CORRELATION AND RISK FACTORS  Many pneumonia etiology studies rely on naso/ oropharyngeal specimens for pathogen detection in addition to blood, serum, sputum, and urine (only in adults) because lower respiratory specimens are not practical or possible unless clinically necessary. Because most of these specimens do not come not directly from the lung, it is difficult to discern the association of a pathogen detection with pneumonia. Thus, many studies have enrolled asymptomatic controls along with pneumonia cases to help determine the possible contribution of respiratory viruses (attributable risk) to pneumonia at a population level. However, studies show variable prevalence of viruses among controls, possibly due to differences in definitions and methods for ascertainment of controls. 32 Different strategies for control enrollment may be applicable to different study objectives and settings. 32 In the EPIC study, all pathogens except for HRV were detected in 3% or less of asymptomatic controls; HRV was detected in 17% of pediatric controls compared with 22% of children with pneumonia (P 5 .04). 7, 8 In asymptomatic adult controls, only 2% had any pathogen detection, compared with 27% among the patients hospitalized with pneumonia; interestingly, HRV was rarely detected in adult controls (1%). 3, 8 In the EPIC study, the attributable fraction (AF) was calculated by comparing prevalence of viruses in pneumonia cases with asymptomatic controls, and adjusting for age, enrollment month, and enrollment city. In this analysis, the AF indicated that the detection of influenza, RSV, and HMPV among all patients, both children Epidemiology of Viral Pneumonia and adults, indicated an etiologic role. However, the detections of PIV, CoV, and AdV, particularly in children, did not demonstrate high AF for pneumonia. HRV was associated with pneumonia in adults but not children. 8 The exact role of HRV in pneumonia remains unclear and controversial, even when detected as a single pathogen, particularly because HRV can shed for greater than 2 weeks after a primary infection, making its detection at time of pneumonia challenging to interpret with respect to the current clinical illness. [22] [23] [24] Data from the EPIC study are similar to other US data from Singleton and colleagues, 33 which compared asymptomatic Alaskan children less than 3 years old from the community with children hospitalized with respiratory infections. In this study, RSV, PIV, HMPV, and influenza viruses were all significantly more common in hospitalized children than controls, but HRV, AdV, and CoV were not; interestingly, children with RSV only or HMPV only had more severe illness compared with children with the other viruses.Data from the recent US studies, including the EPIC study, are somewhat in contrast to data from the PERCH project site in Kenya, which tested for multiple pathogens (bacteria and viruses) in children less than 5 years old with pneumonia and in comparison to community controls (who could have had an upper respiratory infection). In the Kenya site for the PERCH project, compared with controls, RSV was the only virus determined to have a statistically significant association with hospitalization. 14 The differences between the study results are likely due to variations in case and control definitions, prevalence of pathogens in the different studies, geography, and sociocultural characteristics that determine access to health care, threshold for hospitalization, and vaccination coverage for available immunizations.In addition to nuances around etiology, the clinical spectrum of illness due to respiratory viruses is broad and encompasses asymptomatic infection, upper respiratory infection, and lower respiratory tract infection, resulting in pneumonia as well as other complications (eg, acute respiratory distress or secondary bacterial infection). Clinically, symptoms due to any specific virus infection, including in relation to pneumonia, largely overlap; thus, there are few clinical clues to distinguish between illnesses due to different pathogens. Some epidemiologic clues such as age and seasonality may be helpful. In addition, greater than 25% of children and less than 5% of adults are found to have multiple pathogens, potentially including both viruses and bacteria, and on this basis alone could be expected to have a mixed clinical presentation. 3, 7 There are some data from comparisons of patients with illness of varying severity that suggest that bacterial pneumonia contributes to more severe illness. For example, in the EPIC study, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacteriaceae combined accounted for 16% of detected pathogens among adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) as compared with 6% among adults not admitted to the ICU. 3 Thus, when bacteria were detected, it was more likely in a severely ill patient. However, it is important to note that viruses were detected in 22% of adults admitted to the ICU compared with 24% not admitted to the ICU; so although there were no statistically significant differences between the severe and nonsevere groups, viral pneumonia contributed to ICU admissions, mechanical ventilation, and also death.Influenza viruses are some of the more commonly recognized viruses that cause pneumonia and can lead to a primary viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, or mixed viral-bacterial pneumonia. 25, 34, 35 Much of the influenza-associated pneumonia literature has focused on pandemics, 36, 37 including the most recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic. [38] [39] [40] During interpandemic years, influenza virus circulation varies, and thus, rates of influenza-associated pneumonia vary from year to year. Data from these reports indicate that in comparison to patients with influenza virus infection without pneumonia, patients with influenza virus infection and radiographic evidence of pneumonia have a more severe course of illness in terms of longer length of stay, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and death. 40 Although RSV is commonly associated with bronchiolitis, it is also a well-known cause of the clinically and radiographically defined pneumonia, with RSV burden highest among children less than 2 years old. Most children are infected with RSV by 2 years of age, and the first infection, which may not confer immunity, is usually most severe. Prematurity and young age have been shown to be independent risk factors for hospitalization. 41 In countries with a high HIV prevalence, RSVassociated acute lower respiratory tract infection has led to an increased risk of hospitalization and death, and longer hospital stay in children with HIV infection compared with children without HIV infection. 42 RSV has also been shown to lead to acute respiratory infection in adults, including hospitalization, with the highest burden among adults greater than 50 years old. 20 In addition to older age, other risk factors for RSV infection in adults include immunocompromised states and chronic lung conditions. 43 Pneumonia was reported in almost half of the children who were hospitalized with HMPV infection in one multisite study of acute respiratory illness conducted in the United States. 44 Similar to RSV, prematurity and asthma have been shown to be more frequent among hospitalized children with HMPV infection than children without HMPV infection. 44 Risk factors for HMPV infection and subsequent complications, including pneumonia and hospitalization in adults, include older age, and underlying conditions, including asthma, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 21 In addition to annual epidemics of respiratory viruses, it is important to be vigilant for new and emerging viruses that can lead to severe illness including pneumonia, hospitalization, and death. Recent examples include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 45 47 Avian influenza viruses are circulating in birds, both wild and domesticated, throughout the world. Although many viruses are considered low pathogenic avian influenza A viruses, there are highly pathogenic virus strains as well that have been detected in humans. Illness can range from mild to severe, including pneumonia, and cases are often sporadic and after contact with infected birds or their fluids; closing of live bird markets has been shown to reduce transmission. From 2003 to 2016, there have been 854 infections of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus reported to WHO, among which there were 450 (53%) deaths. 48 Human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus were first reported in China in 2013. 49 Since then, there have been 798 laboratory-confirmed infections in China; most infections are sporadic with a few clusters of infection. There is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. 50 Since 2014, there have also been outbreaks in North America and elsewhere among wild and domesticated birds with influenza A (H5Nx and H7N8), which are considered highly pathogenic viruses in birds, but thus far, there have not been any human cases (http://www.oie.int/en/animal-healthin-the-world/update-on-avian-influenza/2016/).  GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF RESPIRATORY VIRUS-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA  Although active and systematic surveillance for all respiratory viruses has increased globally and is strongest for influenza viruses, it is still lacking throughout much of the world. 51 Many questions remain about the seasonality of influenza and other respiratory viruses in tropical countries where there is increasing evidence of year-round circulation of influenza in warmer, more humid climates. [29] [30] [31] 52 Country-specific studies to better understand the contribution of viruses to pneumonia are still required, especially from low-and middle-income countries. The PERCH project will further the understanding of pneumonia in children less than 5 years old, 14 but data on older adults and pneumonia remain scant.Country-specific data on pneumonia, from high, low, and middle income are continually needed because the prevalence of respiratory viruses varies due to seasonal and geographic differences. Incidence also varies, including by age but also due to socioeconomic and sociocultural factors. In addition, access to prevention and control methods that may be in place in some but not all countries (ie, vaccination coverage for S pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae, antibiotics, or antivirals) can affect the epidemiology of viral pneumonia. Risk factors for pneumonia, such as malnutrition, air pollution, tuberculosis, or coexisting malarial infection, may be more relevant in low-and middle-income countries than in more developed countries, where underlying conditions or tobacco exposure may be more prevalent among patients with pneumonia. 34, 35 In addition, most pneumonia studies have been performed in hospital settings. However, in many parts of the world, including developed and developing nations, viral pneumonia does not always result in hospitalization; deaths are missed because they occur at home. 53 Thus, more studies conducted in the community and also outpatient settings are needed to more fully understand the burden and epidemiology of respiratory viral pneumonia.  SUMMARY  The burden of pneumonia, including that due to respiratory viruses, is markedly higher in the very young (<5 years) and older adults (50 years). Viruses are commonly detected, and clinically, it is difficult to distinguish between viral and bacterial pneumonia for most patients at presentation. Further development of new rapid diagnostic tests that can accurately distinguish among potential pathogens is urgently needed to better inform clinical care and public health practice. 54 Treatment and vaccination are only currently available for influenza despite the high burden of RSV, HMPV, and other viruses. Development of effective vaccines and treatments for these viruses of importance could reduce the burden of pneumonia and their complications in both children and adults around the world.  				1	1			
27198803	Trypanosoma teixeirae: A new species belonging to the T. cruzi clade causing trypanosomosis in an Australian little red flying fox (Pteropus scapulatus)	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7116988/	Abstract Little is known about the genetic diversity and pathogenicity of trypanosomes in Australian bats. Recently a novel trypanosome species was identified in an adult female little red flying fox (Pteropus scapulatus) with clinical and pathological evidence of trypanosomosis. The present study used morphology and molecular methods to demonstrate that this trypanosome is a distinct species and we propose the name Trypanosoma teixeirae sp. n. Morphological comparison showed that its circulating trypomastigotes were significantly different from those of Trypanosoma pteropi and Trypanosoma hipposideri, two species previously described from Australian bats. Genetic information was not available for T. pteropi and T. hipposideri but phylogenetic analyses at the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) loci indicated that T. teixeirae sp. n. was genetically distinct and clustered with other bat-derived trypanosome species within the Trypanosoma cruzi clade.	Introduction  Bats (order Chiroptera) are reservoirs of numerous zoonotic pathogens including rabies, Australian bat lyssavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Hendra virus, Nipah virus and Ebola virus (Wood et al., 2012) . Trypanosomes are blood-borne flagellate protozoan parasites that can infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts including humans. Numerous trypanosome species have been identified in bats in Asia, Africa, South America and Europe (Hoare, 1972; Baker, 1973; Marinkelle, 1976 Marinkelle, , 1979 Gardner and Molyneux, 1988a,b; Hamanaka and Pinto Ada, 1993; Steindel et al., 1998; Barnabe et al., 2003; Grisard et al., 2003; Lisboa et al., 2008; Cottontail et al., 2009; Maia da Silva et al., 2009; Cavazzana et al., 2010; Garcia et al., 2012; Hamilton et al., 2012; Lima et al., 2012 Lima et al., , 2013 Marcili et al., 2013; Silva-Iturriza et al., 2013; Cottontail et al., 2014; Ramirez et al., 2014) .In Australia, three Trypanosoma spp. have been described in bats to date: Trypanosoma pteropi from the black flying fox (Pteropus gouldii) (Breinl, 1913; Mackerras, 1959) , Trypanosoma hipposideri from the dusky horseshoe bat (Hipposideros bicolor albanensis) and Trypanosoma vegrandis, in pteropid bats (Yangochiroptera) and microbats (Yinpterochiroptera) (Austen et al., 2015) . None of these have been associated with clinical disease. In addition, Mackie et al. (2015) recently described the first case of trypanosomosis in a little red flying fox (Pteropus scapulatus-suborder Yinpterochiroptera) from eastern Australia, caused by an apparently novel trypanosome species.Molecular and phylogenetic studies have suggested that bat trypanosomes are implicated in the evolutionary history of the T. cruzi clade and may potentially be the precursor of trypanosomes from Australian marsupials and several African terrestrial mammals Lima et al., 2013) . There is however very limited knowledge about the genetic diversity of Australian bat trypanosomes, where only 9 of 76 indigenous bat species have been screened for this parasite (Thompson et al., 2014) .In the present study, we describe the morphological and genetic characterisation of the novel trypanosome in the little red flying fox http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2016.05.002 0304-4017/© 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. (Mackie et al., 2015) , for which we proposed the name Trypanosoma teixeirae sp. n.  Sample collection  A venous blood sample was collected from the cephalic vein of an adult female little red flying fox that presented to the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital (AZWH) in April, 2014. The flying fox had been rescued from the ground at Redcliffe in south-eastern Queensland, Australia and was moribund with anaemia and icterus. Clinical and pathological evidence of disease consistent with trypanosomosis in this flying fox was described by Mackie et al. (2015) .  Morphological analyses  Thin blood smears were made from a drop of fresh blood and stained with Diff Quick (Siemens, Germany). After air-drying, the slides were then cover-slipped using DePeX mounting medium Gurr (Merck Pty. Limited, Kilsyth, Victoria, Australia). Stained films were systematically examined using a BX50 microscope (Olympus, Japan) with screen views generated by a DP Controller (version 3.2.1.276, Olympus, Japan). Digital light micrograph images of any trypomastigotes observed were taken at ×1000 magnification.Digital images of the organisms identified in the blood films were used to measure key morphological features such as total length (TL), width (W), posterior to kinetoplast (PK), kinetoplast to nucleus (KN), nucleus to anterior (NA) and free flagellum (FF), according to parameters described by Hoare (1972) and Mackerras (1959) . Means and standard errors were calculated. The morphological measurements were taken using the software Image J (Abramoff et al., 2004) .As two trypanosome species have previously been described in Australian bats based on morphological analysis only (Breinl, 1913; Mackerras, 1959) , morphometrics of the novel trypanosome was compared statistically with available measurements for T. pteropi and T. hipposideri. Mean values for each morphological feature were calculated for T. teixeirae sp. n. whilst median values of reported ranges were used as input data for T. pteropi and T. hipposideri, as means were not available in the bibliographical references. Statistical analyses were conducted using the one sample t-test, in the software PAST 1.43 (Hammer et al., 2001) .  DNA extraction  Genomic DNA was extracted from 200 l of whole blood, using the MasterPure Purification Kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, USA). A DNA extraction blank (with sterile molecular-grade water instead of blood) was included in the extraction to exclude the contamination of reagents and consumables with DNA.  18S rRNA and GAPDH amplification and sequencing  A nested PCR protocol using generic Trypanosoma sp. primers SLF, S762R, S823F and S662R (Maslov et al., 1996; McInnes et al., 2009 ) was performed to amplify an approximately 900 bp fragment of the 18S rRNA gene, as previously described by McInnes et al. (2009) . The DNA sample was also amplified at the glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) gene using a heminested PCR protocol (McInnes et al., 2009) .PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel containing SYBR Safe Gel Stain (Invitrogen, USA), and visualized with a dark reader trans-illuminator (Clare Chemical Research, USA). The gel bands were purified using an in-house filter tip method as previously described (Yang et al., 2013) . All controls (positive, negative and DNA extraction blank) produced appropriate PCR results.The purified PCR products were sequenced using the corresponding internal reverse primers diluted at 3.2 picomoles with an ABI PrismTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) on an Applied Biosystem 3730 DNA Analyzer.  Phylogenetic analysis  Nucleotide sequences obtained at both 18S rRNA and GAPDH loci were aligned with additional trypanosome sequences retrieved from GenBank (Table 1) by MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) using the default settings. Ambiguous regions containing gaps or poorly aligned were removed by Gblocks (Castresana, 2000) , available on the Phylogeny.fr platform (Dereeper et al., 2008) , using low stringency parameters. The curated alignments were imported into MEGA 6 (Tamura et al., 2013) and the most appropriate nucleotide substitution model was selected using the dedicated function.The evolutionary histories at both 18S rRNA and GAPDH genes were inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model (Tamura and Nei, 1993) . The gamma shape parameter was estimated directly from the data. Reliability for internal branch was assessed using the bootstrapping method (500 bootstrap replicates) and support values (>60%) indicated at the left of each node. The phylogenetic trees were drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site.Estimates of genetic divergence between sequences were generated in MEGA 6 based on the Tamura-Nei algorithm, using uniform rates and a partial deletion of 95%.  Microscopy and morphometric analysis of T. teixeirae sp. n.  A total of nine organisms morphologically consistent with a trypanosome were detected by light microscopy in blood films from the little red flying fox. The extracellular organisms were slender with tapered ends, with long free flagellums and either an undeveloped or absent undulating membrane. A nearly central nucleus and a terminal small round deeply staining internal structure consistent with a kinetoplast were also observed (Fig. 1a-c) . The trypomastigotes varied in length from 20.4 to 30.8 m (average 25.9 m) and in width from 1.3 to 2.3 m (average 1.9 m) ( Table 2) .Among the nine long slender organisms observed, two were not true trypomastigotes as their kinetoplast was located at the very end of the posterior, what made it impossible to calculate the PK distance. In another instance, the trypomastigote's free flagellum was apparently under a red blood cell, hence any measurements taken of FF or TL would have been inaccurate. We have therefore only measured what was feasible, which explains the divergence in the number of organisms measured for each morphological feature (Table 2) .Three flagellate round forms with a flagellum running round the organism about 90 degrees were also observed (Fig. 1d) . Their body shape was consistent with a sphaeromastigote or a round epimastigote if their flagellar position was considered.Morphometric analysis revealed that although the reported length and width ranges for the T. teixeirae sp. n. and T. pteropi overlap, the former was significantly longer and thinner than the latter (p < 0.01) ( Table 3 ). There was no significant difference between KN, NA and FF dimensions between T. teixeirae sp. n. and T. pteropi. In addition, T. hipposideri was significantly smaller than T. teixeirae sp. n. for TL and FF dimensions (p < 0.01) ( Table 3 ). No significant difference was observed for B, PK and KN between T. teixeirae sp. n. and T. hipposideri.  Sequence and phylogenetic analysis  Maximum Likelihood analysis at both the 18S rDNA and GAPDH loci (Figs. 2 and 3, respectively) produced concordant tree topologies and revealed that T. teixeirae sp. n. grouped with other trypanosomes belonging to the T. cruzi clade, including 7 batderived isolates (T. cruzi Tcbat, T. cruzi marinkellei, T. erneyi, T. dionisii, T. rangeli, T. vespertilionis and T. sp. AJ012418/GQ140365) and three isolates from Australian marsupials (T. sp. H25 from a kangaroo-AJ009168/AJ620276; T. sp. AB-2003-G8 from a woylie-KC753537/KC812988; and T. sp. AP-2011-64 from a brush-tailed possum − JN315383/AJ620276). The phylogenetic trees also corroborated the evolutionary relationships among all major trypanosome clades described in previous broader analyses. Nucleotide sequences were obtained at both loci for T. teixeirae sp. n. were submitted to GenBank under the following accession numbers: KT907061 and KT907062.Estimates of evolutionary divergence between nucleotide sequences revealed that T. teixeirae sp. n. was genetically distinct but most closely related to T. minasense and T. rangeli (genetic distances of 1% at the 18S rDNA locus and 14%-15% at the gGAPDH, respectively) (Table 4) .  Species description  Species Name: Trypanosoma teixeirae sp. n.

This is the fourth trypanosome species to be reported in indigenous Australian bats and the first one associated with clinical disease.Unfortunately no genetic data was available for two of the previously reported bat-derived trypanosomes in Australia (T. pteropi and T. hipposideri). Trypansosoma pteropi was described as having a slender body (total length 18-22 m; width 2-4 m), an underdeveloped undulating membrane and a long free flagellum whereas T. hipposideri is very small and slender (total length 10.5-13 m; width 1.5-2 m), with a delicate short free flagellum at the anterior end (Breinl, 1913; Mackerras, 1959) . Statistical analysis however, revealed that T. teixeirae sp. n. was significantly larger than both T. pteropi and T. hipposideri, even though they had several other overlapping morphometric features. However, morphology alone is not a reliable tool to delimit trypanosome species due to the interspecific similarities and intraspecific variability (Dunn et al., 1963; Marinkelle, 1966; Dunn, 1968) .Besides the typical trypomastigotes, two round forms (sphaeromastigotes or round epimastigotes) were also observed. The term 'sphaeromastigote' (Brack, 1968) refers to the parasite body shape Fig. 3 . Phylogenetic relationships of Trypanosoma teixeirae sp. n. with other trypanosomes, based on gGAPDH partial sequences (∼775 bp). Evolutionary relationships were determined by Maximum Likelihood, based on the Tamura-Nei model (Tamura et al., 2013) . Bootstrap values (>60%) based on 500 replicates are indicated at the left of each supported node. The scale bar is the proportion of base substitutions per site. Trypanosome species from bats are shown with an asterisk. only and has been applied without reference to the flagellar development. However, as these forms may occur within different stages of the parasite's development, it is more appropriate to characterise the round organisms observed in the present study as round epimastigotes, considering both their body form and flagellar features (Elliott et al., 1974) . This stage normally occurs in the interior of the cell, in vessels or in the insect gut.Evolutionary reconstructions at both 18S rDNA and gGAPDH revealed that T. teixeirae sp. n. was genetically distinct from all known trypanosomes. The use of these two genes is recommended for taxonomic analysis of trypanosomatids and validation of new trypanosome species (Hamilton et al., 2004; Viola et al., 2009; Teixeira et al., 2011; Lima et al., 2012 Lima et al., , 2013 Borghesan et al., 2013) .Phylogenetic analyses at both 18S rRNA and gGAPDH loci revealed that T. teixeirae sp. n. clustered within the T. cruzi clade together with all other bat-derived trypanosome species described to date, except T. livingstonei (which was positioned basal to the T. cruzi clade), T. evansi (which belongs to the T. brucei clade) and T. vegrandis (which forms a separate group associated with other marsupial-derived trypanosomes found in Australia) (Hamilton et al., 2007; Botero et al., 2013; Lima et al., 2013; Austen et al., 2015; Carnes et al., 2015) . At the gGAPDH locus, T. teixeirae sp. n. was closest to T. minasense and T. rangeli and exhibited 14% and 15% genetic Table 4 Genetic distances between Trypanosoma teixeirae sp. n. and other trypanosome species at 18S rRNA and gGAPDH loci.  Trypanosome species/isolate  Genetic distances (%)18S rDNA gGAPDHGenetic distances were calculated in MEGA 6 (Tamura et al., 2013) using the Tamura-Nei model (Tamura and Nei 1993) .distance from these two species respectively. T. minasense has been found in neotropical non-human primates from South America (Ziccardi and Lourenco-de-Oliveira, 1999) whilst T. rangeli has been reported in a range of mammalian hosts including Brazilian bats (Maia da Silva et al., 2009) . Although T. teixeirae sp. n. exhibited a relatively low (1%) genetic distance from its closest related species at the 18S rRNA locus, a similar pattern was observed when comparing other previously described species among each other. For instance, genetic distances between T. minasense and T. vespertilionis were 1% and 12% at the 18S rRNA and gGAPDH loci respectively. Trypanosomes have few morphological features detectable using light microscopy which can adequately delimit species (Gibson, 2009 ). Previous studies have reported that a genetic distance of 3.75% at the GAPDH gene is sufficient to delimit a new trypanosome species . By this criterion, T. teixeirae sp. n. is clearly a separate species. Bat trypanosomes have been implicated in the evolutionary origin of T. cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, one of the most important public health issues in South America Bonney, 2014) . The 'bat-seeding' theory suggests that T. cruzi evolved from within a broad clade of bat-derived species, which have made the switch into terrestrial mammals Lima et al., 2013) . The theory also implies that these arboreal trypanosomes species could potentially be evolutionary precursors for the terrestrial trypanosome lineage within Australian mammals Lima et al., 2013; Thompson et al., 2014) .It is therefore possible that T. teixeirae sp. n. could be the precursor of three marsupial-derived trypanosomes belonging to the T. cruzi clade: T. sp. H25 (Averis et al., 2009) , T. sp. AP-2011-64 (Paparini et al., 2011) and T. sp. AB-2013-G8 (Botero et al., 2013) . As most native bat species remain unsampled (Thompson et al., 2014) , future studies are required to provide more evidence to support the 'bat-seeding' theory in Australia and elucidate evolutionary relationships between trypanosomes.Similarly to most bat trypanosomes described worldwide, the prevalence, distribution, vectors, life cycle and zoonotic potential of T. teixeirae sp. n. remain unclear. Therefore, more studies comprising a larger sample size are required to better understand the prevalence and clinical impacts of T. teixeirae sp. n. on bat populations, taking into account ecological and stress factors that could play a role in the expression of clinical disease.  					1			
9694323	Rapid preparation of plasma membranes from avian lymphoid cells and fibroblasts for virus binding studies	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119565/	Abstract A simple and rapid protocol for the preparation of plasma membranes from chicken embryo fibroblasts and chicken lymphoid cells was developed. Characterization of the preparations by morphological, biochemical and serological methods indicated the specific enrichment of the plasma membranes as well as cell surface proteins. Binding of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) particles was demonstrated after immobilization of the plasma membranes, and cell type-specific differences were observed. Although the results of these studies reflect the interaction between IBDV and isolated cells only partially, the advantages of these plasma membrane preparations, the specific enrichment of cell surface proteins, their constant quality and the possibility to store aliquots over several months, make them a useful tool for virus binding studies with avian cells.	Introduction  Cellular plasma membranes form the first barrier for viruses in the infection cycle. Investigations of early interactions of virus particles with their receptor sites on the cell surface may provide important insight into host cell tropism and therefore, pathogenicity, and antiviral strategies can be evaluated on the basis of these results. Permanent cell lines are used most often for the investigation of the early steps in the viral life cycle in order to applicate a defined counterpart. However, to answer specific questions, especially with regard to host cell tropism, it will sometimes be necessary to use primary cells in order to mimic the in vivo conditions. Preparation of primary cells, for example lymphocytes, is time-consuming and may often be unsatisfactory due to variable results associated with the quantity and quality of the preparations. Furthermore, rapid cell degeneration can produce misleading results during the course of binding studies.The preparation of plasma membranes of primary cells can help overcome these problems. Starting with a pool of cells, plasma membranes with a constant quality can be produced and stored for several months. During the binding studies, misleading results due to contamination with intracellular compartments can also be avoided. A simple and rapid method is described now for the preparation of plasma membranes derived from chicken lymphoid cells and chicken primary fibroblasts. The purity of these preparations was confirmed by morphological, biochemical and serological investigations. Their binding activity was tested with infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) particles and the results were compared to published binding studies with IBDV particles and primary cells (Nieper and Mü ller, 1996) .  Cells  Primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were prepared according to standard procedures (Dulbecco and Vogt, 1954; Youngner, 1954) ; erythrocytes in the cell suspensions were removed by treatment with the ACK-buffer (0.15 M NH 4 Cl, 1.0 mM KHCO 3 , 0.1 mM EDTA; pH 7.2) described by Coligan et al. (1992) . Lymphoid cells from the bursa of Fabricius, spleen or thymus of 3-to 12-week-old specific pathogen free chicken were prepared by mincing these organs with scissors and centrifugation of the cell suspension in Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia) as described elsewhere in detail (Mü ller and Becht, 1982) . All cells were suspended in washing buffer consisting of 25.0 mM HEPES, 154 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl 2 ; pH 7.4 (Ferber et al., 1972) and were kept on ice during further manipulations whenever possible.  Plasma membrane preparation  Plasma membranes of CEF and lymphoid cells derived from bursa of Fabricius, spleen, or thymus were prepared following a protocol described by Maeda et al. (1983) with several modifications (see Fig. 1 ). All plastic and cellulose nitrate tubes were soaked in 1 mM EDTA pH 7.0 overnight and rinsed ten times with doubly distilled water before use. The cells, washed three times in the washing buffer described above, were resuspended in a 3-fold (w/v) excess of homogenization buffer (25.0 mM HEPES, 30 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1.0 mM dithiothreitol, 1.0 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 vM pepstatin A; pH 8.0) and kept on ice for 10 min. Thereafter, the cells were disrupted by 30-40 strokes in a 'tight fitting' (lymphoid cells) or a 'loose fitting' (CEF) Dounce homogenizer, respectively. Immediately after homogenization restoration buffer was added (25.0 mM HEPES, 0.6 M NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl 2 ; pH 8.0) in order to achieve a final concentration of NaCl of 154 mM. EDTA was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. After centrifugation (5000× g, 10 min, 4°C, SS34 rotor, Sorvall), a 25 ml volume of the resulting supernatant was layered over 12 ml of a 25% sucrose cushion (sucrose was dissolved in isotonic homogenization buffer). After centrifugation (100000×g, 1 h, 4°C, SW28 rotor, Beckman L8-55), plasma membranes forming a white band at the interface were collected, diluted with washing buffer and sedimented by centrifugation (100000×g, 30 min, 4°C, SW41 rotor, Beckman L8-55). They were resuspended in washing buffer and the protein concentration was determined in a microtiter plate assay using BCA protein reagent (Pierce). Aliquots of the membranes were stored frozen at −20°C up to three months.  Marker enzyme analysis  5%-nucleotidase is a marker enzyme of plasma membranes; this activity was determined using a diagnostic kit provided by Sigma. The activity of the plasma membrane-specific (Na + +K + )-AT-Pase was determined according to Kinne et al. (1971) . The activity of the glucose-6-phosphatase, a marker enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum, was measured according to Harper (1962) ; 0.1 M imidazole buffer was used instead of a Na-citrate buffer as described by Nordlie and Lygre (1966) . Alkaline and acid phosphatases were inhibited by EDTA and Glucose (Hü bscher and West, 1965) . Released inorganic phosphate was determined according to Chen et al. (1956) .  Electron microscopy  Plasma membranes were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, washed with PBS and post fixed with 1% OsO 4 . After dehydration in ethanol and propylene acid samples were embedded in epoxy resin (Luft, 1961) . Ultra thin sections (0.1 vm) were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and examined with an electron microscope EM 902 (Zeiss).  SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining, immunoblot  Proteins from cells and plasma membranes were dissociated in sample puffer (Laemmli, 1970) ; polypeptides (10 vg per slot) were sepa-rated in discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gels (15%) with or without reducing agents (Mini-Protean II, Bio-Rad). Gels were fixed (25% isopropanol, 10% acetic acid; 15 min), stained with 0.1% Coomassie brilliant blue R250 suspended in fixation solution for 15 min and destained (45% methanol, 10% acetic acid). For immunologic detection of plasma membrane specific proteins, separated polypeptides were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore) by the semidry blotting procedure. After blocking (5% non fat dry milk in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) membranes were incubated with a monoclonal antibody directed against chicken Ia antigen (generous gift from Thomas Graf, Heidelberg). Antibody binding was visualized by biotinylated antiglobulin, streptavidin peroxidase and chloronaphthol as substrate.  Virus binding studies  For binding studies in an ELISA-like procedure, plasma membranes were resuspended in coating buffer pH 9.6 (1.59 g Na 2 CO 3 , 2.93 g NaHCO 3 , 0.2 g NaN 3 per 1000 ml) and coated to U-shaped wells of microtiter plates (Greiner) at 4°C overnight. After incubation with blocking buffer (1% BSA, 0.5% gelatine, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% thimerosal in PBS) for 3 h at 37°C, plasma membranes were incubated with purified IBDV particles for 2.5 h at 37°C. Binding of viral antigen was detected with virus-specific polyclonal antibodies from rabbits (1 h at 37°C) and the biotin-streptavidin-system. An amount of 1.2 phenylendiamine was used as substrate; extinction coefficients were measured at 492 nm. The plates were washed five times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 with an ELISA washer (Nunc) after each step of incubation.  Preparation of plasma membranes  Using a single method for the preparation of plasma membranes from cells of different origin and morphology may be critical, since buffers, mechanical forces during homogenization and the conditions during centrifugation have to be adapted to each cell type. Maeda et al. (1983) have established a simple and rapid method for the preparation of plasma membranes applicable to a broad range of cell types, including fibroblasts and lymphocytes. To increase the purity and yield of plasma membranes obtained from various types of chicken cells, this method was modified considerably. Further modifications were introduced with regard to the consecutive methods of characterization. An abbreviated protocol is shown in Fig. 1 .The first series of experiments was performed to optimize the washing, homogenization and restoration buffers described above (data not shown). Essentially, a phosphate-free buffer system was chosen to be able to characterize the membrane preparations biochemically by marker enzymes most of which release inorganic phosphate. When Tris buffers were used to stabilize the plasma membranes as recommended by Warren (1974) , the enzymatic activities were very low in the preparations. Therefore, a HEPES-based buffer (Ferber et al., 1972) , pH 8.0 to stabilize the cell membranes (Evans, 1987) , was used. An 0.5 mM concentration of MgCl 2 was employed in order to stabilize the nuclear membranes during incubation in hypotonic homogenization buffer (Allan and Crumpton, 1970; Ferber et al., 1972) since MgCl 2 at higher concentrations led to the aggregation of lymphoid cells. Homogenization with Dounce homogenizers was given preference to the Polytron homogenizers used by Maeda et al. (1983) because their mechanical forces proved to be more gentle for cell disruption. To prevent osmolytic damage of the cell compartments and to conserve the structures and the enzymatic activities in the plasma membranes, isotonic conditions were re-established immediately after homogenization by the addition of restoration buffer. EDTA was added to complex divalent cations as these can lead to aggregations of plasma membranes with the nucleus (Ferber et al., 1972) and also may activate metalloproteases. As a further modification, an additional step of differential centrifugation was undertaken prior to density gradient centrifugation in order to remove cell debris, mitochondria and nuclei from the homogenates. Centrifugation of the membrane preparations in discontinuous sucrose gradients (40, 30, 20 and 10%) showed an increase of plasma membrane-specific enzymes and a decrease of the marker enzyme for the endoplasmic reticulum at lower sucrose concentrations; yields, however, at 10% sucrose concentration was only low. Satisfactory results with regard to purity and yield were obtained by centrifugation of the plasma membranes on a 25% sucrose cushion, in accordance to a protocol described by Perdue (1974) .  Polypeptide patterns of a6ian cells and plasma membrane preparations  The patterns of the cellular proteins and those of the plasma membrane preparations obtained following the protocol outlined in Fig. 1 were determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie brilliant blue R250 staining (Fig. 2) . In all of the plasma membrane preparations several polypeptides, present in the cell lysates and presumably representing histone proteins, were missing: A group of three proteins with apparent molecular weights between 14 and 16 kDa and one protein of 32 kDa. There was, however, a significant enrichment of two proteins of approximately 40 and 43 kDa and one high molecular weight protein in all plasma membrane preparations. Plasma membrane preparations of different lymphoid cell types had similar polypeptide patterns; however, the polypeptide pattern of plasma membranes prepared from CEF proved to be different, especially in the high molecular weight region.  Biochemical analysis of marker enzymes  The activities of marker enzymes for plasma membranes ((Na + + K + )-ATPase, 5%-nucleotidase) or the endoplasmic reticulum (glucose-6phosphatase) as the major contaminant indicate the purity of plasma membrane preparations. These enzyme activities, determined in the cell homogenates and the plasma membrane prepara- tions, are summarized in Table 1 . The specific activities of marker enzymes for plasma membranes were significantly increased in the plasma membrane preparations: As compared to the cell homogenates, the activity of the (Na + +K + )-ATPase was increased 6 -12-fold and the 5%-nucleotidase activity was increased 4 -10-fold. The highest increase in specific activity of both enzymes was observed in plasma membranes derived from CEF. However, an increase in the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase (2 -3-fold) was also observed and all attempts to reduce this activity by modifying the isolation protocol were unsuccessful.  Morphological examination by electron microscopy  The morphological examination of the plasma membrane preparations by electron microscopy revealed vesicles of various size and shape. No nuclei or mitochondria could be detected, but at the inner side of some of the vesicles, small cytoplasmic hems could be observed (Fig. 3) . These results are in accordance with those of the biochemical characterization.  Analysis of the plasma membrane preparations by serological methods  Chicken Ia antigen, a cell surface molecule present on chicken lymphoid cells, corresponds to the human MHC II antigen (Guillemot et al., 1984) ; CEF do not express this antigen. To benefit from the high resolution of serological methods, this protein was investigated by Western blotting in order to demonstrate the enrichment of plasma membrane-specific proteins by the established protocol. In addition, this test could indicate alterations of the plasma membrane proteins by this isolation procedure. Proteins of cell homogenates and plasma membrane preparations were separated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and reacted with a monoclonal antibody directed against the chicken Ia antigen (Fig. 4) . The antibody bound to the non-reduced molecule with an apparent molecular weight of 55 kDa. A constant amount of protein had been loaded on each slot; therefore, the strong increase of chicken Ia antigen in the plasma membranes of lymphoid cells indicates the efficiency of the applied protocol. Specific activity of marker enzymes of the plasma membrane ((Na + +K + )-ATPase, 5%-nucleotidase) and endoplasmic reticulum (glucose-6-phosphatase) in the cell homogenates (ch) and plasma membrane preparations (pm), preparations of lymphoid cells from bursa of Fabricus, spleen, thymus and chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF). Results presented as mean 9S.E. of three different preparations. a Specific activity = mmol/mg×h. b Enrichment= Specific activity in pm/Specific activity in ch.  Binding of IBDV to immobilized plasma membranes  In order to test binding of IBDV particles to the plasma membranes, an ELISA-like solidphase virus binding assay was developed. Increasing amounts of protein (up to 10 vg/well) were coated onto plastic wells and incubated with a constant amount of IBDV particles. Viral antigens bound to the membranes were detected with an IBDV-specific polyclonal antiserum and the biotin-streptavidin system. As shown in Fig. 5 , the plasma membrane preparations obtained from all types of chicken cells bound IBDV particles. Virus binding to the plasma membranes was related directly to the amount of the membrane proteins added, indicating that these were not severely affected by the isolation procedure. The same efficiency of binding was observed with both IBDV serotypes. Plasma membranes derived from CEF bound IBDV particles more efficiently than those derived from lymphoid cells. Binding of the serum proteins was less than 5% of total binding when virus was omitted. Similar results were ob-tained when a pre-immune serum was used. No binding of IBDV specific antibodies could be detected, when the membranes were omitted. The assay was equally sensitive and specific when culture supernatants from IBDV infected CEF were used in place of gradient-purified virus particles.  Discussion  Several methods for the preparation of plasma membranes from different types of tissues or isolated cells have been described. Most of these protocols were established for specific cell types or applications and cannot be used with other cell or tissue types without considerable loss of purity or yield. For chicken cells, only protocols for the preparation of plasma membranes from CEF have been published (Perdue and Sneider, 1970; Perdue, 1974) . These, however, caused denaturation of marker enzymes and the selective loss of some membrane components (Perdue, 1974) . Therefore, a protocol was established for chicken cells, based on a method applicable to a wide range of different cell types and tissues, including human fibroblasts and lymphocytes (Maeda et al., 1983) . Modifications of the buffer system, concentration of Mg 2 + and sucrose, as well as the procedures of homogenization and centrifugation, increased purity and yield of the plasma membranes prepared from chicken embryo fibroblasts and lymphoid cells considerably.The plasma membranes were examined by biochemical and serological methods and visualized by electron microscopy. The biochemical examination indicated the enrichment of plasma membrane markers as opposed to endoplasmic reticulum markers. Contamination with membranes from other organelles, notably from Golgi, have been neglected, considering that these might not be essential in virus binding studies. Using this simple and rapid method a level of purity was achieved which, as indicated by (Na + +K + )-AT-Pase activity, was considerably higher than described for chicken cells before (Perdue and Sneider, 1970) . Glucose-6-phosphatase was also enriched, however to a significantly lower extent, indicating traces of endoplasmic reticulum. Allan and Crumpton (1970) , and Johnstone and Crumpton (1980) achieved a 9-11-fold enrichment of 5%-nucleotidase activity in plasma membrane preparations from pig lymphocytes, whereas only a 4-8-fold enrichment was achieved with chicken lymphoid cells in the experiments described above. Glucose-6-phosphatase activity, however, was enriched to the same extent. Our efforts to remove endoplasmic reticulum, e.g. by rising pH values during homogenization and centrifugation or by additional washes of the plasma membranes in hypotonic buffers, remained without success.Immobilized isolated plasma membranes have been used in binding studies, among others, with mouse hepatitis virus (Boyle et al., 1987) , human coronavirus 229E (Yeager et al., 1992) and hepadnavirus (Pontisso et al., 1989a,b; Qiao et al., 1992) . The enrichment of the chicken Ia antigen in the plasma membrane preparations from lymphoid cells indicates that cell surface proteins were not severely altered by the preparation procedure. Binding of IBDV particles of both serotypes to the plasma membranes could be demonstrated in an ELISA-like procedure. By a modified blotting technique (VOPBA), described elsewhere in detail (Nieper and Mü ller, 1996) , the specificity of binding of IBDV particles to these plasma membrane preparations was demonstrated in competition experiments.Differences in binding of virus particles of different serotypes to cells or plasma membrane preparations have been described for reovirus and Theiler virus: In vitro binding studies with reovirus serotype 1 and 3 demonstrated a common and a serotype 3-specific receptor on L cells (Ambler and Mackay, 1991) and endothelial cells (Verdin et al., 1989) , whereas in VOPBA studies with plasma membranes derived from L cells (Choi et al., 1990) or endothelial cells (Verdin et al., 1989) no differences in virus binding could be observed. Similar results were obtained with two serotypes of Theiler virus and BHK cells and plasma membranes (Fotiadis et al., 1991; Kilpatrick and Lipton, 1991) . In the ELISA-like procedure, IBDV particles of both serotypes The percental adsorption is shown to compare the binding of both strains to the plasma membranes. OD 2.0 was taken as 100%. Specific binding was determined by substracting unspecific binding of serum and virus particles to the plate from total binding. bound to plasma membranes derived from CEF more efficiently than to those derived from lymphoid cells. These differences were more prominent in in vitro binding studies performed with IBDV particles and avian cells (Nieper and Mü ller, 1996) . Furthermore, cell and serotype specific differences observed in the in vitro binding studies with isolated lymphoid cells could not be shown with the plasma membrane preparations. In the in vitro studies virus particles of serotype 2 bound to a higher extent than serotype 1 particles. In addition it had been observed that the efficiency of binding of serotype 1 particles to isolated lymphoid cells was in the order bursa of Fabricius, spleen and thymus. These differences can be due to several reasons.(1) The in vitro studies were based on cell numbers. CEF are larger than lymphoid cells; lymphoid cells isolated from bursa of Fabricius and spleen are larger than those isolated from thymus. Cells with a larger surface might express more virus binding sites and higher amounts of protein were present in the test. It might be speculated, therefore, that a larger number of virus particles can be bound. In contrast, the same amount of protein had been used for each cell type in the ELISA study.(2) Immobilization of plasma membranes can lead to alterations of their binding activity (Yic and Lingwood, 1992) .(3) The preparation procedure, e.g. the disruption of the native membranes, might result in alterations of virus binding structures. Similar differences have been described with human rhinovirus (Staunton et al., 1989) and murine Moloney leukemia virus (Johnson and Rosner, 1986) .  					1			
190280	Proposed Calfhood Immunization Program for the Commercial Dairy Herd	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131246/	Abstract Immunization programs never will usurp the central role of sound management practices and good nutrition in the disease prevention program of the commercial dairy operation. However, certain immunizations against disease such as brucellosis, leptospirosis, and clostridial infections should be routine. Other disease such as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine virus diarrhea, parainfluenza-3, colibacillosis, and pasteurellosis should be considered if it can be determined that the herd is infected chronically. The present knowledge of other disease conditions, vaccine effectiveness and safety makes the use of vaccines for other diseases of questionable value.	INTRODUCTION  The task of rearing healthy" calves as milking-line replacements always has been a major problem of the dairyman. Little thought is required to realize that the death loss of potentially great producers due to scours and pneumonia in the baby calf is a major difference between a financially rewarding and a marginal or bankrupt operation. Management and nutrition are the keys to the door of successful disease prevention. Prophylaxis and treatment can be considered only, at best, a second line of defense against decimating diseases of the dairy calf. The prevention of disease by enhancing the immune mechanisms of the baby calf to increase its resistance to disease never should become more important in the dairyman's mind than the strict adherence to good management practices and sound nutritional programs. Such sound principles as the assurance by the dairyman that the neonatal calf receives adequate amounts of antibodyladen colostrum within the first few hours of life cannot be overemphasized. Even though this practice has a sound immunologic basis, it will not be considered in this discussion except as it applies to specific vaccination programs. The purpose of this report is to make an unbiased evaluation of the many vaccines available and try to develop recommendations 1 for a reasonable vaccination program based upon scientific knowledge of the immunogenicity of the product, the resistance developed in the animal vaccinated, and the reasonable risk involved in not vaccinating the animal. The report is organized around bacterial and viral disease agents that may be expected in neonatal, young, and growing calves.  Diseases of the Neonatal Dairy Calf  The most prominent diseases in the neonatal dairy calf may be divided for convenience of discussion into septicemias and diarrhea-respiratory disease complexes.Septicemias. Septicemic diseases usually occur in the first few hours of life. The syndrome is due to the growth and circulation of pathogenic bacteria and their toxigenic products within the blood stream. The clinical signs of fever, hemorrhages in the mucosal surface, lethargy, prostration, and hypoxia are indications of a grave prognosis. The disease can be caused by bacteria in virtually every genera of bacteria, but the most common ones, Streptococci, Escbericbia, Salmonellae, Corynebacteria, Klebsiella, and Proteus, usually enter the blood stream through superficial wounds in the mucosaI surfaces or severed naval cords. The value of colostrum to prevent such serious infections is unknown. Maternal antibody could play an important role as a protective mechanism in light infections, but gross contamination always would overwhelm such protective mechanisms. No known vaccines to be used in the neonate have been effective nor would be expected tO be developed against these bacterial agents. Viremias are in the same category as the above, but both conditions seem to be reasonably rare.Diarrhea-respiratory disease complex. Bacterial and vital pneumoenteritis of the neonatal calf is perhaps the most prevalent cause of calf losses. A review of the literature indicates that many different agents are involved in the pathogenesis of diarrheal disease of the neonatal calf. These agents may be singularly causal or may serve as concert pathogens in combined infections. They may be divided conveniently into bacteria and viral agents. Bacterial causes include such well known agents as Escbericbia coli (colibacillosis), Salmonella typbimurium, S. Dublin, and other sp. (Salmonellosis) and, occasionally, other genera of bacteria. The viral agents associated with pneumoenteritis include bovine virus diarrhea-mucosal disease virus (BVD), reovirus, coronavirus, adenoviruses, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), bovine parvoviruses, and probably enteroviruses.  Bacterial Diseases of the Neonatal Calf  Colibacillosis. It has been estimated that E. coil is responsible for 90% of the calf losses in early neonatal life. Colibacillosis may account for as many as 50% of the calf losses in a herd, and death rates of 10 to 20% are not uncommon. Because the disease strikes so early in life, it probably is not reasonable to believe that a vaccine could be developed that would immunize the individual effectively soon enough to prevent disease. Recent experimental data shows promise, however, in immunization of the dam with bacterins prepared from known pathogenic strains of the organism (31). Myers and his colleagues (30) have shown that effective resistance to experimentally induced cotibacillosis is induced in calves nursing dams immunized with bacterins injected subcutaneously 1 yr previously and 1 wk before the expected beginning of calving within the herd. The practice of preparing autogenous bacterins from E. coli strains isolated from problem herds to vaccinate dams has been recommended by veterinarians for years, but these reports are sound scientific evidence that the procedure is effective. Though commercial vaccines are not now available, Myers (30) reports that "a commercial firm has prepared the vaccine for sale and will release it for marketing as soon as a license becomes available." He recommends that the primary vaccination be administered 6 mo before and a secondary booster be given 1 mo before the expected calving date. The effectiveness of such a vaccination program on experimental infections with the homologous strain of E. coil provides hope for the dairyman, but the results of this and other investigations (8, 11) must be verified carefully against the efficacy of the procedure on a routine herd basis. The impact of strain differences in vaccine development and immunospecificity cannot be predicted with certainty.Salmonellosis. Acute enteritis in neonatal dairy calves caused by salmonella infection are not rare, but the incidence is much lower than E. coli infections. The same type of general conditions apply as in the colibacillosis situation. Vaccination programs designed to immunize the dam and thereby provide antibodies via the colostrum offer hope. Since salmonella infections are more prone to be a serious disease in later life, it would be more feasible to suggest the possibility of developing a bacterin to be used in early calfhood to protect from Salmonellosis. The availability of effective vaccines for commercial use is unknown to the author. The procedures for development and potency testing of Salmonella vaccines have been reported (2) .  Viral Diseases of the Neonatal Calf  Bovine virus diarrhea (BVD) causes serious disease in calves (35) . Experiments by Lambert et al. (23) indicated that deaths due to acute enteritis may occur within 18 to 96 h of birth and that chronic diarrhea could exist for weeks. Widespread use of attenuated live viral diarrhea (BVD) virus vaccines has been reported (22) . Their use in dairy calves has been recommended in conjunction with concentrated anti-BVD bovine serum (20) . However, the seriousness of side reactions and the chronic nature of BVD infections has prompted caution and has promoted the investigation of killed virus vaccine development (21) . Experimental evidence indi-SMITH cated that such inactivated vaccines can be prepared (9, 10) but currently are not available commercially.Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR)virus has caused intestinal disease in young and neonatal calves (12, 34) . The wide range of symptoms recorded (12, 16) exemplifies the complex nature of the disease in chronically infected herds. The agent is apparently widespread in dairy herds (16) , but each of these reports indicates that the widespread use of modified live virus vaccines may be responsible for some of the evidence for the existence of chronic infections. The intranasal type vaccine to prevent disease is recommended by workers actively pursuing research in this area (17) . The primary vaccination should be given at 4 to 6 days of age, a secondary booster vaccination should be given at 6 mo of age and again at one yr and annually thereafter. The dangers of a modified live virus vaccine causing overt disease in immunodeficient calves or of reverting to the virulent form at present cannot be evaluated properly. Our own research indicates that few passages in bovine tissue culture cells and an increase in the viral titer of the inoculum will cause similar lesions to the field strain when inoculated by the same routes and that recrudescence of the vaccine virus by chemical immunosuppression causes overt disease. The use and effectiveness of an attenuated nonabortigenic temperature sensitive mutant of IBR has been reported (41) . The theory behind such an effort is intriguing, but the vaccine must still be considered experimental.Adenovirus infections have caused diarrheal disease in newborn calves in Europe (3) and North America (5, 24) . Bovine adenovirus type 5 has been implicated as being one of the causal agents in the so-called "weak-calf syndrome" and has produced mild diarrhea when inoculated into neonatal calves (25) . Adenovirus vaccines have been used widely in Europe (6) , but their effectiveness is questionable. A limited field trial is underway in this country, but recommendations for their use in a herd health program must be withheld until such time as a proven potent, safe vaccine is available and the extent and importance of the disease condition in this country is known.Bovine reoviruses have caused diarrheal disease in young calves (26, 39) , and it has caused high incidence of herd epizootics in beef herds (40) . The use of a modified live virus has been reported and, its use recommended to control outbreaks of the disease when a definite diagnosis has been made in a herd (27) . Since adequate nonvaccinated controls were not used, it has been difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine in controlling natural outbreaks of diarrhea. Expanded studies were reported later (28) , but the evidence for the necessity for routine vaccination programs and efficacy of the vaccine in preventing diarrhea is not convincing.Coronaviruses have caused diarrheal disease in neonatal calves. Their morphology and pathogenicity in neonatal gnotobiotic calves were described (36) . The infections were in 12 of 19 beef herds examined. Though commercial vaccines are available, the scientific data are insufficient to determine the efficacy, potency, safety, and necessity of vaccination as a routine procedure.Enteroviruses and paroviruses have been associated with diarrheal disease of the young calf (1, 37) . They are apparently widespread infections, and diagnosticians and other investigators often isolate one or both from calves with diarrhea. These viruses frequently are isolated from calves that are apparently healthy. The knowledge of the pathogenicity of these two groups of viruses is not complete.Our studies indicate that massive doses of bovine enterovirus inoculated orally in neonatal colostrum-deprived calves even when immunosuppressed with corticosteroids did not cause serious enteric disease.  Diseases of the Juvenile and Young Adult Cattle  Consideration of routine immunization of calves against several well known diseases should be incorporated into recommendations for a vaccination program for herd replacements.Brucellosis. The vaccination of dairy calves with Brucella abortus strain 19 is a well accepted and scientifically sound principle (18) . The vaccine is recommended for calves, except bulls (19) , at 4 mo of age. However, the establishment of persistent infections with shedding of live organisms in the milk following standard vaccination procedures (29) (14) . The outlook is promising, but commercial vaccines are not available.Vibriosis. General infections with Campylobacter (Vibrio) fetus virtually has been eliminated in the modern dairy industry principally through artificial insemination procedures (4). However, in infected herds, vaccination of adult cows (15) and bulls (7) can prevent and eliminate the problem.  Recommended Vaccination Program  The following recommendations are based upon the author's personal judgment and predicated upon personal ownership of an imaginary average commercial herd operation. Several routine immunization practices can be recommended as outlined in Table 1 .Diagnosis of a specific disease condition within a herd would indicate that other vaccination programs should become routine, and in those conditions listed in Table 2 should be continued in a routine. In each situation I believe the determination of the herd status by serologic or other accepted diagnostic techniques should receive high priority to enable one to make specific recommendations for the herd immunization program.Immunization against bacterial diseases listed in Table 3 should become routine when the disease condition has been diagnosed or vaccines have been proven efficacious and are available for commercial use.  							1	
30195552	Risk of Bacterial Coinfections in Febrile Infants 60 Days Old and Younger with Documented Viral Infections	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094460/	Objective To determine the risk of serious bacterial infections (SBIs) in young febrile infants with and without viral infections. Study design Planned secondary analyses of a prospective observational study of febrile infants 60 days of age or younger evaluated at 1 of 26 emergency departments who did not have clinical sepsis or an identifiable site of bacterial infection. We compared patient demographics, clinical, and laboratory findings, and prevalence of SBIs between virus-positive and virus-negative infants. Results Of the 4778 enrolled infants, 2945 (61.6%) had viral testing performed, of whom 1200 (48.1%) were virus positive; 44 of the 1200 had SBIs (3.7%; 95% CI, 2.7%-4.9%). Of the 1745 virus-negative infants, 222 had SBIs (12.7%; 95% CI, 11.2%-14.4%). Rates of specific SBIs in the virus-positive group vs the virus-negative group were: UTIs (33 of 1200 [2.8%; 95% CI, 1.9%-3.8%] vs 186 of 1745 [10.7%; 95% CI, 9.2%-12.2%]) and bacteremia (9 of 1199 [0.8%; 95% CI, 0.3%-1.4%] vs 50 of 1743 [2.9%; 95% CI, 2.1%-3.8%]). The rate of bacterial meningitis tended to be lower in the virus-positive group (0.4%) than in the viral-negative group (0.8%); the difference was not statistically significant. Negative viral status (aOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.3-4.6), was significantly associated with SBI in multivariable analysis. Conclusions Febrile infants ≤60 days of age with viral infections are at significantly lower, but non-negligible risk for SBIs, including bacteremia and bacterial meningitis.	  A pproximately 500 000 infants 60 days of age and younger are evaluated annually in emergency departments (EDs) in the US because of fever. 1, 2 Of these infants, 8.4%-12.9% have confirmed bacterial infections and more than 50% have documented viral infections. [1] [2] [3] The relatively immature immune system of these young infants predisposes them to developing invasive bacterial illnesses such as bacteremia and bacterial meningitis, and many also develop urinary tract infections (UTIs). Collectively, these 3 infections are referred to as serious bacterial infections (SBIs). Expert guidance for management includes obtaining blood screening tests, which may include a white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), band count, and serum procalcitonin and C-reactive protein concentrations, in addition to urinalysis and evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as cultures of these fluids. This is primarily because previous   ORIGINAL ARTICLES  literature has demonstrated that the clinical examination is limited in establishing a precise diagnosis or excluding diagnoses in most febrile infants. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Blood, urine, and CSF cultures are the reference standards to confirm SBIs and many clinicians treat young febrile infants empirically with antibiotic(s) intravenously and often hospitalize these young infants until bacterial culture results are available. [4] [5] [6] Owing to widespread availability of rapid turnaround and point-of-care testing for viral infections, many clinicians are less likely to perform comprehensive evaluations for SBI in the presence of confirmed viral infections, because the risk of SBI has been shown to be lower among infants who come to attention because of fever and are confirmed to have viral infection. 7, 8, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] However, most previous studies that have attempted to determine the risk of SBI among young febrile infants with viral infections have been conducted on small cohorts, 8 had retrospective study designs, 11, 12 were limited to a single viral infection, and/or were performed more than a decade ago. 8, 11, 12, 14, 15 In this planned subanalysis of a large, multicenter, prospective cohort study of febrile infants 60 days and younger evaluated for SBIs, we compared the risk of SBIs between viruspositive and virus-negative infants.  Methods  We performed a planned secondary analysis of a prospective observational cohort study on a convenience sample of febrile infants 60 days of age and younger who were evaluated for the presence of SBIs with at least a blood culture at 26 EDs in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) from December 2008 to May 2013. The methods for the parent study have been reported previously. 16, 17 The institutional review boards at all participating sites approved this study and eligible infants were enrolled only after informed consent was obtained from the parents/guardians of participants. The methods pertinent to this secondary analysis are described herein.  Selection of Participants  We enrolled febrile infants (defined by ED rectal temperatures of >38°C, or temperatures of a similar degree measured at home or at a referring clinic) evaluated in the ED with laboratory evaluations that included blood, urine, and/or CSF cultures. In addition to testing for SBI, infants evaluated in this secondary analysis had to be tested for the presence of at least 1 viral infection. We excluded infants with clinical signs of sepsis, prematurity, major systemic comorbidities (eg, serious congenital abnormalities, inborn errors of metabolism), or clear evidence of focal bacterial infections (not including otitis media) because the management of these febrile infants is not controversial.  Measurements  For each patient, clinicians prospectively recorded patient demographics, physical examination findings including the Yale Observation Scale (YOS) score, and laboratory test results. The YOS is a clinical score that provides a quantitative assessment of wellness and clinical risk of SBI in febrile infants and toddlers based on simple clinical and observational findings. 10 A YOS score of 10 or less is considered normal. Tests for the presence of viral infections were performed at the discretion of the individual clinicians. There was variability across sites regarding the type and number of viral studies performed, ranging from testing for individual seasonal viruses (such as respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] and influenza during winter months) to comprehensive respiratory viral panels.  Outcomes  The main outcome was the diagnosis of SBI, which we defined as the presence of bacterial meningitis, bacteremia, or UTI, or any combination of these 3 infections. Patients were considered not to have an SBI when blood and urine cultures were negative. Patients were excluded from the main SBI analysis if either blood or urine culture results were negative and meningitis status was unknown. However, when any of these cultures was positive, the patient was considered to have an SBI. We defined bacteremia and bacterial meningitis as growth of a known pathogen in the blood or CSF, respectively. Patients who did not have lumbar punctures performed were included in the analysis for bacterial meningitis if they were available for telephone follow-up. We categorized these patients as not having bacterial meningitis if they were well at the time of telephone follow-up. Cultures with growth of multiple bacteria or those not commonly considered pathogens (eg, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, diphtheroids, Bacillus species, viridans streptococci) were categorized as contaminants and considered negative for the analysis of SBI. We defined UTI as the growth of a single pathogen in the urine with colony counts meeting 1 of 3 criteria: (1) greater than 1000 cfu/mL if specimen obtained by suprapubic aspiration, (2) greater than 50 000 cfu/mL from a catheterized specimen, or (3) greater than 10 000 cfu/mL from a catheterized specimen in association with an abnormal urinalysis (positive for leukocyte esterase or nitrites, or >5 white blood cells per high-power field on microscopic examination of unspun urine). 18, 19 We also categorized febrile infants for the purpose of analysis on the basis of results of viral tests as virus positive or virus negative.  Statistical Analyses  We compared patient demographics and histories, physical examination findings, laboratory results, and prevalence of SBIs between virus-positive and virus-negative infants. We also compared the risk of SBI in viral-positive and virus-negative infants stratified by age (≤28 days vs >28 days of age). We analyzed continuous variables using the Student t test and categorical data using risk differences. Ordinal variables were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We also compared rates of SBI by individual type of virus detected. Finally, we performed a multivariable logistical regression analysis to assess the association of viral infections with SBIs, adjusting for patient age, temperature, YOS, complete blood count and ANC. All statistical tests were 2 tailed. Statistical significance was designated at P < .05. Statistical analyses were performed using Volume 203 • December 2018 SAS software version 9.4 (SAS institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina).  Results  A total of 4778 febrile infants were enrolled in the parent study. Of these, 3072 (64.3%) had viral testing performed. A total of 578 patients had single viral tests performed on, 2186 had testing for 3 or more viruses, and 1515 had comprehensive respiratory panel testing. We were able to ascertain viral test results and SBI status in 2945 of the 3072 febrile infants (95.9%), and these 2945 infants were included in the analysis. There were 1706 infants who did not have viral testing performed and, among these, we were able to ascertain SBI status in 1637 (nonanalytic cohort). The overall rate of SBI in this virusnot tested cohort was 177 of the 1637 (10.8%; 95% CI, 9.3%-12.4%).The mean age of the 2945 infants evaluated in this secondary analysis was 34.1 ± 0.3 days. The mean temperature was 38.5°C ± 0.01°C. There were 1092 infants (37.1%) who were 28 days of age or younger. The characteristics of virus-positive and virus-negative infants are described in Table I . Virusnegative infants were more likely to be 28 days of age or younger and to have a higher mean white blood cell count and ANC count than viral-positive infants. Table II describes the various types of viral tests that were performed on enrolled patients across the participating EDs.  Rates of Viral Infections and SBIs  Overall, of the 2945 infants analyzed, 266 (9.0%; 95% CI, 8.0%-10.1%) had SBIs. This included 219 (7.4%; 95% CI, 6.5%-8.4%) with UTIs, 59 (2.0%; 95% CI, 1.5%-2.6%) with bacteremia, and 19 (0.6%; 95% CI, 0.4%-1.0%) with bacterial meningitis. In addition, of the 219 infants with UTIs, 21 (9.6%; 95% CI, 6.0%-14.3%) also had bacteremia and 2 of the 219 (0.9%; 95% CI, 0.1%-3.3%) had both bacteremia and 11 .2%-14.4%), yielding an absolute risk difference of 9.0% (95% CI, 7.2%-10.9%). The rates of specific SBIs including UTI and bacteremia were significantly lower in viruspositive infants compared with virus-negative infants ( Table III) . Although the rate of bacterial meningitis tended to be lower in the virus-positive group (0.4%) than in the virusnegative group (0.8%), the difference was not statistically significant (Table III) .When stratified by age group, regardless of virus status, the overall rate of SBI was 12.5% (136 of 1092) in febrile infants 28 days of age or younger compared with 7.0% (130 of 1853) among infants older than 28 days of age (difference 5.5%; 95% CI, 3.2%-7.7%). Virus-positive infants 28 days of age or younger had lower rates of SBI than virus-negative infants in the same age cohort ( Table IV) .The rates of SBI in infants was consistently lower in the viruspositive group regardless of specific viruses identified compared with virus-negative infants ( Table V ; available at www.jpeds.com).In the multivariable analysis with SBI status as the dependent variable, the variables that were significantly associated with SBI were virus-negative status (aOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.3%-4.6), age 28 days or younger (aOR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1%-1.9), temperature (aOR, 1.8 for every 1°C increase above 38.0°C; 95% CI, 1.4%-2.4), and ANC (aOR 1.3 for every 1000 cells/mm 3 increase; 95% CI, 1.2-1.4). Table VI (available at www .jpeds.com) provides the details regarding bacteria and viruses identified in the study cohort.  Discussion  In this large multicenter study, we demonstrated that infants 60 days old and younger who come to medical attention with fever and who have confirmed viral infections are at substantially lower risk for SBIs than virus-negative infants. However, the non-negligible 3.7% rate of SBI including the 1.0% rate of invasive bacterial infections (bacteremia and meningitis) in virus-positive febrile infants should be taken into consideration during clinical decision making regarding evaluation, management, and disposition.Many young febrile infants have viral or presumed viral infections, and several previous studies have similarly revealed lower risks of SBI among febrile infants with documented viral infections. 7, 8, 11, 12, 15 Compared with the earlier studies, the current study was large, prospective, and had the statistical power to provide more precise estimates of rates. A previous multicenter, prospective study in febrile infants 60 days old and younger with and without documented RSV infections revealed UTI and bacteremia rates of 7.0% and 1.1%, respectively, in RSV-positive infants compared with 12.5% and 2.3% in RSV-negative infants. 14 In a separate subanalysis of that same cohort, a lower rate of SBI and invasive bacterial infection was also documented when influenza-positive febrile infants were compared with those infants without documented influenza infections, 15 similar to the findings of the current study. Other studies using retrospective cohorts similarly revealed a lower prevalence of SBI among virus-positive febrile infants. [7] [8] [9] 11 The substantial practice pattern variation that exists in the evaluation of young febrile infants has been influenced by the increasing availability of multiplex panel, rapid turnaround viral tests. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] Some studies have revealed that providers frequently change their behavior when they are aware of the results of viral tests. 20, 25 Furthermore, virus-positive febrile infants are less likely to receive empiric antibiotics or to be hospitalized and are more likely to receive antiviral therapies. [20] [21] [22] A recent survey of ED and inpatient clinicians in 16 Canadian pediatric centers using a 3-week-old and a 5-week-old febrile infant case scenarios further highlights the substantial variation in the evaluation and management of febrile infants based on the results of viral tests. Surveyed hospitalization rates for the 3-week-old infant after detection of a respiratory virus decreased from 95% to 83% (P < .001) and for the 5-week-old The percentages in the columns represent the proportion of infants with the type of SBIs stratified by age category and by individual type of SBI.  December 2018  ORIGINAL ARTICLES infant from 52% to 36% (P < .001). Treatment with empirical antibiotics also decreased after detection of a respiratory virus for the 3-week-old infant (92% vs 65%; P < .001) and the 5-week-old infant (39% vs 25%; P < .001). 20 Despite the lower prevalence of SBI among virus-positive febrile infants documented in the current and earlier studies, the implications for clinicians are not straightforward. Some investigators have suggested that the performance of comprehensive evaluations for SBI, especially lumbar punctures, can be avoided 26 in the presence of a documented viral infection in a well-appearing young febrile infant and the use of empiric antibiotics and hospitalization can be reconsidered. 27 Others have suggested that practices should be based on the age of the infant, with a full evaluation for SBI including lumbar puncture in the first month of life despite the presence of a viral infection, because SBI rates remain non-negligible in this highest risk age group and the ability to determine wellness by the YOS is limited. 14, 15, 24 Our study findings add to the current knowledge regarding the epidemiology of SBI as well as the risk of SBI among virus-positive febrile infants. The strengths of the current study include a large, geographically diverse, prospective cohort of febrile infants who were comprehensively evaluated for SBI, and our risk estimates for SBI were therefore more precise and generalizable than in previous studies. Furthermore, we did not limit our study to a single virus or individual viral illnesses, such as bronchiolitis or influenza.The data identified a non-negligible risk of bacteremia and bacterial meningitis in the first 2 months of life. We suggest that clinicians need to exercise caution, especially in the first month of life, regarding comprehensiveness of evaluation including performance of lumbar punctures, regardless of virus infection status. For both age groups, at a minimum, an evaluation for UTI by collecting samples for urinalysis and urine culture should be strongly considered regardless of viral status. Finally, our study suggests the importance of incorporating the results of viral testing to provide better risk estimates of SBI in these infants and assist the clinician with decisions regarding lumbar puncture, empirical antibiotic treatment, and hospitalization. Formal decision analyses and cost-effectiveness analyses using these data will help to develop recommendations regarding viral testing and its impact as a part of the evaluation and management of these young febrile infants.Our study has several limitations. First, the parent study cohort consisted of a convenience sample of febrile infants and viral testing was performed at the discretion of the treating clinician during a time in which rapid testing was evolving. Furthermore, the number of viruses detectable and type of tests performed varied between sites (1) by season, (2) by type of test, namely, polymerase chain reaction vs other, (3) whether single viral tests or multiplex viral polymerase chain reaction panel tests were performed, (4) by type of specimen (nasal swab vs throat swab), and (5) by what tissue or fluid was sampled (CSF vs blood vs respiratory secretions). It is possible that the rates of SBI and the prevalence of viral infections detected would be different if comprehensive viral testing was performed on all patients or if higher sensitivity and specificity viral testing was used. Therefore, we cannot comment on the exact prevalence of viral infections in our study cohort. However, if higher, some of the current virus-negative patients with SBIs may have been virus positive with SBIs, and could have increased the rate of coinfection, thus, strengthening our conclusions. In addition, it is possible that the risk of SBI may vary with the type of viral infection and with the number of viral coinfections. 20 Despite these limitations, the rate of SBI in the enrolled population was remarkably similar to that described in previous studies. 28, 29 Second, we intentionally excluded febrile infants with obvious sources of bacterial infections (such as cellulitis) and critically ill-appearing infants because those infants represent a less significant diagnostic and therapeutic conundrum. The purpose of our study was to identify the risk of SBI in noncritically ill-appearing febrile infants who have confirmed viral infections to aid clinician decision making. Third, the analysis in which we stratified by type of viral infection did not have sufficient power to detect statistically significant differences in the risk of SBI by virus type; nevertheless, the results are hypothesis generating. Despite the substantial size and multicenter design of the study, we also did not have sufficient statistical power to comment on the risk difference in bacterial meningitis between virus-positive and virus-negative infants. Therefore, we suggest that clinicians retain low thresholds for performing lumbar punctures in young febrile infants with documented viral infections, especially those younger than 1 month of age. In addition, most of the EDs in PECARN are large, tertiary care, academic institutions and practice patterns including testing for viral pathogens as well as evaluation for SBI may not be representative of practice patterns in community EDs or primary care pediatric offices. 27 Finally, the American Academy of Pediatrics has proposed an updated definition of UTI that requires the presence of an abnormal urinalysis and a positive urine culture defined as at least 50 000 cfu/ mL of a pathogenic bacterium. 30 We did not use this definition in our study cohort because these guidelines apply to infants older than 2 months of age.In summary, febrile infants 60 days of age and younger with documented viral infections are at significantly lower risk for SBIs than similarly aged febrile infants who test negative for viral infections. Nevertheless, the risk of SBI was non-negligible in virus-positive infants, particularly UTIs, and approximately 1% of infants with documented virus infections in the first month of life had bacteremia and/or bacterial meningitis. Therefore, we concluded that the presence of a documented viral illness should not affect the initial (ED) evaluation for SBI in febrile infants 28 days of age and younger. In the second month of life, at a minimum, evaluation for UTI would be prudent in febrile infants with documented viral infections, as well as a low threshold maintained for testing for bacteremia and meningitis. ■   				1				
16679048	Early days: genomics and human responses to infection	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108404/	DNA microarray-based gene transcript-profiling of the responses of primates to infection has begun to yield new insights into host–pathogen interactions; this approach, however, remains plagued by challenges and complexities that have yet to be adequately addressed. The rapidly changing nature over time of acute infectious diseases in a host, and the genetic diversity of microbial pathogens present unique problems for the design and interpretation of functional-genomic studies in this field. In addition, there are the more common problems related to heterogeneity within clinical samples, the complex, non-standardized confounding variables associated with human subjects and the complexities posed by the analysis and validation of highly parallel data. Whereas various approaches have been developed to address each of these issues, there are significant limitations that remain to be overcome. The resolution of these problems should lead to a better understanding of the dialogue between the host and pathogen.	Introduction  Since the last review in this journal of DNA microarraybased transcriptome analysis for studying host responses to infection [1] , the adoption of this approach by research groups around the world has continued unabated. This is not surprising, given the rewards that have so far been reaped from this genomic technology, especially in understanding cancer and in the development of new practical tools for classifying cancer patients on the basis of disease outcome or predicted treatment-response. Yet, as shown in Figure 1 , the number of published papers on DNA microarray-based host response profiling in the setting of infectious diseases still lags significantly behind the number of papers on the use of this approach in the study of cancer. There are many probable reasons for this discrepancy.In this review, we focus on studies published from 2004 to present that rely on the use of DNA microarrays to study the host-response to pathogens using human clinical samples or non-human primate models. The use of clinical samples allows the study of host-pathogen interactions in a clinically and physiologically relevant setting by exploring the relationships between patterns of human transcript abundance, human physiological parameters, the natural history of the disease process, and pathogen characteristics. The resulting complexity presents challenges beyond those posed by in vitro experimental systems or small animal models. In this review, we address some of the methodological issues raised by this approach in this setting. An overview of some of the factors to consider in designing DNA microarray-based studies of infectious diseases is provided in Figure 2 . Readers interested in a broad overview of DNA microarray technology and microbial pathogenesis are referred to two other recent reviews [2 ,3] .Where to 'listen': target tissue and cell typeIn the study of naturally-occurring human disease the restricted availability of tissues and cells of various types often dictates the kinds of studies that are feasible. As reflected in the current literature, two different approaches dominate in the selection of human clinical samples. The first approach focuses on peripheral blood: peripheral blood is a relatively accessible source of human cells and RNA, and is a natural choice for analyzing host transcript-based responses in systemic infection. This approach has been used in the study of HIV infection [4, 5] , sepsis [6] , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [7, 8] , malaria [9 ] and febrile illness as a result of upper respiratory tract infections [10]. Most often, RNA is harvested from either peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or from whole blood; whole blood analysis involves less manipulation of the specimen than do most PBMC collection methods [11] and for this reason might be particularly suitable for clinical field studies. However, whole blood (which includes erythrocytes, granulocytes and platelets in addition to the PBMC) is obviously a more complex mixture of cell types, creating additional confounding variables, such as the relative abundance levels of these different cell types (see below). In addition, the large Factors to consider in microarray-based studies of the host response to infection.

In addition, several studies have examined HIVrelated dementia and encephalitis using brain tissues obtained during autopsy [21] [22] [23] . The degree to which host responses to infection are compartmentalized and distinct between different compartments remains poorly described. For example, the correlation between transcript abundance patterns in the peripheral blood and those within local cells of various types at the site of a local infection is unclear. It is not known how well peripheral blood cells might discriminate between local infections caused by different agents at different sites, or how well they might reveal basic mechanisms of local immune response. Clearly, the boundaries between local and systemic compartments are not always distinct, because there are molecular markers in the systemic circulation that can be used as indicators of local infection. For example, serum levels of creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme and cardiac troponin I can be used to monitor myocardial involvement in viral myocarditis; and serum hepatic transaminase levels are used to measure the extent of hepatocellular injury in viral hepatitis. Furthermore, microbial disease agents might traffic through the peripheral blood to a greater degree than previously suspected (e.g. gastroenteritis-associated rotavirus).Human clinical samples other than blood, and cells and tissue from the primary site of infection associated pathology might be useful for DNA microarray-based analysis of infectious diseases. It remains to be seen how robust and informative the RNA-based signatures are from saliva [24] and other body fluids in this context; despite the obvious challenges, the ease of access to some of these sample types justifies further investigation. Various body fluids have already been pursued as sources of proteinbased signatures of infectious disease.  The challenges of minimizing biases and controlling confounding variables  Transcript abundance analysis of the host-response to infection in model systems provides the opportunity to control for, or eliminate, many of the variables present during infection, including differences in environmental factors, host genetic background, pathogen strain, infectious dose, route and timing. Controlled studies of global gene expression patterns in human subjects following infection have not yet been published, although several studies have reported on the consequences of administering microbial components [25 ,26] . Instead, all of the microarray-based studies cited above were observational studies. As with any observational study, findings take the form of associations between the measured variable (gene transcript abundance) and other characteristics of the process being studied (e.g. associated microbial agent, survival and response to treatment); these findings are subject to potential bias and confounding effects. An unidentified or unspecified factor, or characteristic, might lead to an incorrect interpretation -an unwarranted inference of causality -or might limit the ability to infer generalizations from the findings. This issue is prominent in the typical microarray experiment, where thousands, or tens of thousands of genes, reflecting diverse physiological processes are examined all at once.The potential for selection bias can be seen in one report aimed at identifying genes whose expression levels might be used as pretreatment predictors of responsiveness to interferon therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C [17] . Patients infected with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus have a significantly lower rate of response to interferon therapy [27] . Not surprisingly, in these studies, patients with genotype 1 infection were relatively over-represented in non-responder groups. Chen et al. [17] addressed the possibility that the non-response transcriptional profile was simply a genotype 1 profile, by determining that the same set of genes distinguished responders and non-responders among those with genotype 1 infections. However, they did not evaluate their findings in an independent set of samples, and because all non-responders had genotype 1 virus, it is possible that the identified genes only are associated with treatment response in genotype 1 infection.The collection of comprehensive data for a variety of potentially-relevant clinical parameters provides an important means of evaluating the role of potential confounders, and should be carefully considered during study design. Studies in rats have shown that the expression of some liver genes is influenced by fasting and circadian rhythms [28] . However, none of the reports evaluating liver gene expression in hepatitis C indicate whether diet and time of day were recorded during sample collection, or even considered in the data analysis [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] 29] . The issue is not unique to hepatic gene expression; transcript abundance profiles in blood are also known to vary according to gender, blood cell subset abundance, time of day and age [11, 30] . One approach, used in a study of H. pylori-associated patterns of expression in gastric tissue [19] , is to match cases and controls on the basis of potential confounding variables -in this study, samples were matched for age and gender. A second approach is to eliminate from further analysis genes known to be significantly associated with certain clinical parameters [31 ] . Whereas both of these approaches if executed carefully reduce the possibility of arriving at spurious conclusions about the relationship between gene expression and an outcome of interest, they also limit the set of possible subjects from which to draw samples for analysis, and limit the possibility of discovering novel, interesting associations between gene transcript abundance and the matching variables. A third approach is to evaluate the role of the clinical parameters during analysis. Chen et al. [17] used multivariate analysis to evaluate the association of specific genes with clinical parameters, and Griffiths et al. [9 ] evaluated the strength of association of gene expression patterns with each clinical parameter, and identified gene subsets that were associated with each variable. This latter study also demonstrated that certain clinical parameters can help highlight for further study specific aspects of the host transcript-based response to infection, and help to elucidate biological mechanisms.  Sample size, pooling, replication, and frequency  Determining the minimum and/or optimal number of samples (the sample size) for microarray-based studies remains an active research area (reviewed in [32 ] ). None of the studies reviewed for this paper made sample-size determination explicit. At this time, sample size remains largely determined by resource and sample availability. Yet, it is disconcerting to find published microarray-based in vivo studies that include only one sample for each experimental group [33, 34] . In addition to the obvious benefit of achieving statistical significance, sample size estimations facilitate collection of samples in sufficient numbers so that a 'tester set' is available for cross-validation (see further discussion below).Allison et al. [32 ] suggested that pooling of biological samples can reduce variability but obscure the ability to compare variables across individual samples. Pooling of human clinical samples masks the clinical data from each individual sample. The subsequent ability to correlate gene expression patterns with specific clinical parameters is then lost. Once a technical platform is proven reliable in a given laboratory, biological replicates provide much more information and value than technical replicates (i.e. the same biological sample processed and hybridized more than once).Determining appropriate sampling frequency and timepoints is another important aspect of experimental design. Unlike oncological or rheumatological diseases, where the process evolves over months and years, the host response during acute infectious disease is a much more dynamic process, and can produce gene expression changes over time scales ranging from minutes to hours.Calvano et al. [25 ] showed that transcript responses to one dose of intravenous endotoxin occur by the second hour and resolve within 24 hours. In a previous report from our lab, Rubins et al. [35 ] sampled blood from monkeys with smallpox infection over multiple days and found that an interferon-associated transcript abundance response had begun by the first day or two after infection, increased during the first four days and then plateaued around day six. Other data from this study showed that transcript abundance changes can precede the development of clinical signs [35 ] . Taken together, these studies suggest that dense sampling over the time course of infection, beginning prior to the appearance of clinical signs, might be crucial for a complete picture of the gene expression program during acute infectious disease.  Heterogeneity of cell populations in samples  Most human tissues and samples collected for microarray analysis are a mixture of distinct cell types. A mixed cell population, such as whole blood or PBMC, gives a comprehensive picture of gene expression during the systemic host-response to infection, and reflects the overall interactions within a complex system. However, the complex dynamics of a heterogeneous sample poses two different challenges for in vivo experiments. An important gene expression pattern might be undetectable amidst a 'noisy' environment, particularly a pattern generated by a rare cell population. In addition, increases or decreases in the relative abundance of a cell type alters the overall proportion of unique transcripts from that cell type in the total pool of RNA from a given sample. The resulting gene transcript data might simply be a reflection of the sum of unique, constitutive transcript profiles from each cell type, rather than an actual increase or decrease in transcript levels within a given cell type in response to the infection or stimulus.Two studies have examined the different contributions of individual cell types in a complex in vivo mixed population. Mueller et al. [36 ] used laser micro-dissection to harvest the three major epithelial cell types from murine stomach tissue and showed that a H. pylori-specific transcriptional profile is induced only in the mucus-producing pit cells. McLaren et al. [34] compared gene expression differences between antigen-stimulated PBMC and CD4 + and CD8 + T-lymphocyte subpopulations. Their limited analysis suggested that the transcript patterns of lymphocyte subpopulations are distinct and differ from the PBMC population as a whole.Some in vitro experiments have explored gene transcript patterns of specific cell subpopulations, sometimes in response to specific stimuli [30, 37] (Waddell et al., manuscript in preparation). These 'reference studies' have produced gene lists that can potentially be used as signatures for determining the contributions of different cell subsets to the profile of a mixed population without having to separate each subset ex vivo. Several in vivo studies have recognized the contribution of cell population dynamics to gene expression patterns and have performed correlation analysis to identify cell subset abundance effects [9 ,11,35 ] . However, the utility of these secondary data analysis techniques, for example, correlation and signature gene lists, for identifying infection responses in a complex cell mixture remains to be determined.Whether cell sorting and separation is necessary in a study will depend upon the specific experimental aims. For studies with a focus on diagnosis, prediction or classification, it might be acceptable to include patterns reflective of both fluctuating cell populations and gene regulation. However, for studies that are designed to elucidate pathogenesis or mechanism, the difficulties in sorting out contributions from each of these factors could prove too problematic. At a minimum, studies that sample complex tissues and mixtures of cells should collect data on the abundance of various cell types during the timeframe of the disease process. Reduction of sample complexity through purification of individual cell populations might be a necessary and important approach in the future.  Reporting and availability of microarray data  One of the most powerful and as yet, under-utilized approaches to microarray data analysis is to combine primary gene transcript abundance data from different studies in a 'meta-analysis'. Jenner and Young [2 ] employed this approach with a re-analysis of data from 32 studies of host-pathogen interactions. This study demonstrated both a common transcriptional response to pathogens across cell types and studies, as well as specific responses involving Toll-like receptors and subsets of pathogens. However, the usefulness of this approach is limited by the quality and availability of the underlying data. Many transcript profiling papers simply list ''induced'' or ''repressed'' genes, without making available the underlying raw data, or even the values of the clustered and filtered data upon which the lists were based. This type of data reporting structure does not allow for rigorous peer-review of the data, and prohibits future types of combinatorial analysis. In addition, many investigators simply create rank lists of fold changes in transcript abundance as proof for differential expression and proceed to make inferential statements and conclusions based on the highly ranked genes. This approach assumes that the variance in transcript levels for every gene is the same -this is not true in most experiments, leading to unfounded conclusions [32 ] .In 2001, a set of standards was proposed for the review and publication of microarray data [38] (http://www.mged. org/Workgroups/MIAME/miame.html). Submission of microarray data to a public database such as ArrayExpress [39] , Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [40] , or the Center for Information Biology Gene Expression Database (CIBEX) [41] , should be a basic requirement by all journals for publication of manuscripts that present these data, in the same way that submission of gene or protein sequence data to public databases is currently required for publication. The latter requirement has proved invaluable for researchers worldwide. The wealth of information generated with microarray experiments can only be fully exploited if the data are made accessible to the public.  Validation  'Validation' is a term that has been used loosely in the gene expression literature. Generally, validation of results from microarray profiling of host response refers to the corroboration of changes in gene transcript levels using an independent experimental method, such as quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). There is no current consensus on the suitability or need for RT-PCR as an appropriate and/or indicated method for confirmation of microarray data [32 ] . Need might be, in part, based on the importance of obtaining precise quantitative data for specific transcripts in a particular study. At the same time, when a group of co-varying transcripts is found, all of which are known to be associated with the same biological system or signaling pathway, this is strong evidence that this system or pathway is affected by the process under study; independent measurements of specific transcripts might not be necessary. Some recent microarray designs incorporate extensive internal controls, further reducing the need for RT-PCR: one example is the HEEBO (human exonic evidence-based oligonucleotide) and MEEBO (mouse exonic evidence-based oligonucleotide) arrays designed by Alizadeh et al. (http://alizadehlab.stanford.edu). As an alternative, measurement of predicted protein products might be more appropriate in some settings [19] . Rubins et al. [35 ] pursued leads generated by microarray experiments with measurements of interferon protein -following up on the increased abundance of known interferon-regulated gene transcripts, and with detection of apoptotic T-cells by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labelling) assays -following up on the decreased abundance of certain T-lymphocyte-associated transcripts. Obviously, validation of biological leads using in vitro models of hostpathogen interaction remains far easier than validation of such findings in humans [42 ,43] .One of the major advantages of an agnostic method like genome-wide transcript profiling is that it can highlight potentially important genes without being biased or limited by prior assumptions about an experimental system. Researchers tend to ''only look where the streetlight is'', in focusing on genes with familiar names. Pre-existing reagents and tools encourage this behavior, but the increasing availability of comprehensive, genome-wide gene 'knock-down' tools [44] should significantly improve the ability to study unknown genes identified in microarray experiments.Appropriate cross-validation should be performed in studies that generate classifier or predictor sets of genes based on microarray data; Tibshirani et al. [45] provides a brief discussion on the challenges of classification in this setting. In several studies, sets of differentially expressed genes were used to assign samples or cases to clinical categories [6,9 ,10,14,17] . However, in at least one study, no effort was made to deal with generalization error [6] , thus severely weakening the strength of the findings.  Conclusion: forming the big picture  The promise that genomics would improve our understanding of host-pathogen interactions has yet to be fully realized. Yet there are clear indications that progress is accelerating and new insights are accruing. The popularity of microarray-based technologies for examining these interactions will continue to expand as costs diminish, standards are propagated and techniques improve. The degree to which the associated explosion in the quantity of available data is accompanied by comparable gains in biological insight will depend on thoughtful study design, careful data analysis, appropriate follow-up experiments, and public availability of well-annotated, raw, standardized microarray data.Currently, it is also clear that we are not extracting all available higher-order information from these data. Several gene class annotation tools have been developed to identify and organize biological themes among differentially expressed genes [46, 47] . Bioinformatics tools, such as those employed by Calvano et al. [25 ] and Koller's group [48, 49 ] , will further enhance the interpretation of microarray data. In particular, Koller et al. have developed creative computational modeling approaches for deducing biological processes and regulatory networks, based on integration of multiple kinds of highly-parallel genome-wide data, such as primary sequence, gene transcript abundance and protein-DNA association data [48] .From the genomic perspective, host-pathogen interactions involve the interplay of two (or more) distinct genomes. A more comprehensive study of these interactions will entail simultaneous monitoring of all of the associated genes and gene products [50, 51] . We believe that one of the most exciting prospects for this field lies in the integration of genome-wide data from multiple sources. Large-scale random shotgun sequencing efforts using samples from complex microbial communities provide an opportunity to discover and monitor the expression of genes directly from samples of these communities, whether they are host-associated or environment-associated. Community-wide patterns of gene transcript abundance and their variation with respect to time, space and perturbation will reveal fundamentally important aspects of microbial community ecology and physiology, and provide potentially useful diagnostic and prognostic information about the hosts in which communities play critical roles in health and disease. As we construct a high resolution and dynamic picture of the conversation between humans and microbes, we will not only enhance our understanding about fundamental aspects of human biology, but improve the clinical management of infectious diseases.  					1			
18353420	Autophagic machinery activated by dengue virus enhances virus replication	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7103294/	Autophagy is a cellular response against stresses which include the infection of viruses and bacteria. We unravel that Dengue virus-2 (DV2) can trigger autophagic process in various infected cell lines demonstrated by GFP-LC3 dot formation and increased LC3-II formation. Autophagosome formation was also observed under the transmission electron microscope. DV2-induced autophagy further enhances the titers of extracellular and intracellular viruses indicating that autophagy can promote viral replication in the infected cells. Moreover, our data show that ATG5 protein is required to execute DV2-induced autophagy. All together, we are the first to demonstrate that DV can activate autophagic machinery that is favorable for viral replication.	Introduction  Dengue virus (DV) is a positive-single strand RNA virus that belongs to the family of Flaviviridae. The four DV serotypes are transmitted by mosquitoes. In most cases, the symptoms of dengue fever (DF) are self-limited. However, in a small proportion of people the disease progresses to the severe hemorrhagic manifestations of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS).Autophagy is characterized by the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and regulated processes of degradation and recycling of cellular constituents, which are important in organelle turnover and the bioenergetics management of starvation. As well, autophagy plays important roles in cell growth, development, and disease pathology.During autophagy, portions of the cytoplasm or small organelles are sequestered into double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes. Autophagosomes ultimately fuse with lysosomes to generate single-membrane vesicles termed autophagolysosomes, in which the contents are subsequently degraded.Several Atg proteins have been implicated in autophagosome formation. The Atg5 and Atg12 are required to recruit other proteins to the autophagosomal membrane and cytosol to form the autophagic vacuole (Nemoto et al., 2003) . LC3 is the mammalian equivalent of yeast Atg 8. The precursor form of LC3 is post-modified into two forms, LC3-I and LC3-II, which are localized in the cytosol (LC3-I) and in autophagosomal membranes (LC3-II). LC3-II can be used to estimate the abundance of autophagosomes before they are destroyed through fusion with lysosomes (Kabeya et al., 2000; Mizushima et al., 2001) . Similarly, GFP-LC3 fusion protein redistributes from a diffusive state to a vascular aggregative pattern when autophagosomes are formed (Kabeya et al., 2000; Mizushima et al., 2001) . Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been used to detect autophagosome formation, while GFP-LC3 dot formation and expression levels of LC3-II have been used to measure the level of autophagy and the autophagosome formation (Kabeya et al., 2000; Mizushima et al., 2001) .Autophagy not only influences tumor formation, but also plays a role in infectious disease. Macrophages can eliminate Legionella pneumophila infection through cholesterol-or lipid-raft-rich induction of autophagy (Amer and Swanson, 2005) . Conversely, autophagy in pathogen infected non-phagocytes may elevate pathogen replication and infection (Gutierrez et al., 2005) . Infection of human cells with poliovirus and rhinovirus induces the formation of double-membrane cytoplasm vesicles and autophagosome. Autophagosomes are used as the sites of viral RNA replication and these double-membrane structures provide the site for viral RNA replication, possibly enabling the non-lytic release of cytoplasma contents including progeny virions from poliovirus and rhinovirus infected cells (Jackson et al., 2005) . Furthermore, autophagosome is required for the formation of double membrane-bound coronavirus replication complexes, with the formation of the double membrane vesicles significantly enhancing viral replication efficiency (Prentice et al., 2004) . Not only RNA virus (poliovirus etc.) but also DNA virus (Epstein-Barr virus etc.) infection can induce autophagic machinery, and whether the activation of autophagic machinery can enhance viral replication (poliovirus and mouse hepatitis virus etc.) or not (vaccinia virus and herpes simplex virus type 1 etc.) depend on the type of viruses (Alexander et al., 2007; Jackson et al., 2005; Paludan et al., 2005; Prentice et al., 2004; Wileman, 2006; Zhang et al., 2006) . In this report, we demonstrate that DV infection can activate the machinery of autophagy and cause autophagosome formation, which promotes DV replication in an ATG5 dependent manner.  GFP-LC3 dot formation in DV2-infected cells  Because GFP-LC3 fusion protein can bind autophagosomes, the green fluorescent LC3 dot formation in the cell represents autophagosome formation. To clarify whether DV2 infection can activate the machinery of autophagy and induce the formation of autophagosome, GFP-LC3 dot formation during DV2 infection was investigated. Under the fluorescence microscope, the existence of DV2 was demonstrated by labeling the cells with DV2 anti-prM antibody (Red). DV2 infection induced the dot formation of GFP-LC3 fusion protein in the virus infected cells (Red background) (Fig. 1A-e) , compared to the cells harboring GFP-LC3 without DV2 infection ( Fig. 1A-b) . Rapamycin and 3-methyladenine (3-MA) were used to clarify autophagosome formation during DV infection. The cytotoxicity of these two drugs at various dosages was tested and no toxicity was defected ( Supplementary Fig. 1) . Therefore, the optimal dosages of rapamycin (50 nM) and 3-MA (10 mM) were used in this study. The degree of GFP-LC3 dot formation was decreased by treatment of DV2-infected cells with 3-MA (an inhibitor of autophagy) ( Fig. 1A-f ). The cells treated with 3-MA alone or the cells transfected with GFP vector regardless DV2 infection or not could not induce GFP-LC3 dot formation (Figs. 1A-a, A-c, A-d). The cells treated with heat-inactivated virus (iDV2) also could not induce GFP-LC3 dot formation (data not shown). Similarly, GFP-LC3 dot formation was evidently induced in the positive control cells (cells exposed to the autophagosome inducers rapamycin; data not shown). Our data demonstrated that DV2 infection can trigger autophagic machinery and induce autophagosome formation.The time course and the dosage effect of DV2 infection on the percentage of the cells with increased GFP-LC3 dot formation are shown quantitatively. Briefly, after pEGFPC1-LC3 plasmid DNA transfection, the cells expressing green fluorescence and the cells showing GFP-LC3 dot formation were counted, individually. The percentage of GFP-LC3 dot formation was calculated as: number of GFP-LC3 dot formation cells/number of total GFP expressing cells. Fig. 1B shows that the percentage of the cells with increased GFP-LC3 dot formation. The difference of the percentage of GFP-LC3 dot formation cells between DV2 infected (DV2) and noninfected groups (No infection) reached the plateau at 24 h and 36 h p.i. and then declined, indicating the greatest viral induced GFP-LC3 dot formation is at these time points (Fig. 1B) . The GFP-LC3 dot formation was autophagy related, which was demonstrated by 3-MA suppression in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, DV2 induced GFP-LC3 dot formation correlated with increasing MOIs of DV2 either at 24 or at 36 h p.i. (Fig. 1C ). DV2-induced GFP-LC3 dot formation was also detected in BHK and MEF cells (data not shown), suggesting that DV2-induced autophagy is a general event. Our data demonstrate that DV2 can transiently induce LC3 dot formation in a virus titer dependent manner in infected cells.  Increased formation of LC3 type II in DV2-infected Huh7 cells  In quiescent cells, LC3-I as a major form of LC3 evenly distributes in the cytoplasm. Upon exposure to various stresses which provoke autophagy, LC3-II formation was induced. It then sticks onto the autophagosomes. Because the level of LC3-II or the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I expression has been used to represent the level of autophagy, Fig. 1D shows the expression levels of LC3-I and LC3-II in DV2-infected Huh7 cells at 24, 36 and 48 h p.i. The level of LC3-II was evidently increased at 36 h p.i. and declined at 48 h p.i. in DV2-infected cells compared to the uninfected cells (Fig. 1D , lanes 3 and 4 vs. lanes 6 and 7). Accordingly, DV2-induced LC3-II expression in Huh7 cells was suppressed by 3-MA treatment (Fig. 1E , lane 2 vs. 3). Rapamycin treatment of Huh7 cells dramatically increased LC3-II expression was used as a positive control (Fig. 1D , lane 1; Fig. 1E , lane 1). The expression levels of LC3-II in heat inactivated virus-infected cells compared to uninfected control showed no significant difference (data not shown). Our data showed that DV2 induced overexpression of LC3-II reached the maximum at 36 h p.i. The decline of LC3-II expression at 48 h is caused by dissociation of LC3-II from autolysosomes followed by LC3 recycling. Moreover, the LC3-II formation was further enhanced (0.58 to 1.35 folds) in the DV2 infected cells while the inhibitor of microtubule disrupting agent vinblastine was added to block the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes ( Supplementary Fig. 2) , suggesting that the auto-phagy flux is very large (Hoyvik et al., 1986) . Collectively, our data indicate that in infected cells LC3-II can be induced by DV2 indicating the occurrence of autophagy. Co-localization of LAMP1 and LC3 in DV2-infected Huh7 cells LAMP1, a lysosomal protein and a marker of endosomes and lysosomes, can be found at the early stage of autophagolysosome formation during autophagy. It is also used as an indicator of autophagolysosome formation. LAMP1 and LC3 do not distribute in the same region in non-autophagic cells. LC3 colocalizes with LAMP1 during the maturation of autolysosomes has been reported (Jackson et al., 2005) . Co-localization of LAMP1 and LC3 was evidently increased in DV2-infected cells under the confocal microscope (Fig. 2C ). LAMP1 and LC3 colocalization was also detected in the cells treated with rapamycin to induce autophagosome formation (Fig. 2F ). Colocalization of LAMP1 and LC3 was seldom seen in uninfected Huh7 cells (Fig. 2I) and in the infected cell with 3-MA treatment (data not shown). In summary, colocalization of LC3 and LAMP1 observed in DV2-infected cells support our notion that DV infection can trigger autophagic process and induce the formation of autophagolysosomes.  Autophagosome was detected in DV2-infected Huh7 cells and wild type MEF cells  To further confirm that autophagy could be induced by DV2 infection, double membrane autophagosome-like vesicle in DV2 infected cells was observed under TEM. In DV2-infected Huh7 cells, the double-membrane vesicle defined as autophagosome vesicle was found in DV2 infected Huh7 cells (Fig. 3B , arrow). The inlet shows enlargement of the autophagosome in the dotted-black-box (Fig. 3B , white-arrow: outer membrane, black-arrow: inner membrane). Similar double-membrane vesicle (autophagosome vesicle) was rarely seen in uninfected cells (Fig. 3A ) or infected cells in which autophagy process was blocked by 3-MA (Fig. 3C) . Moreover, DV2-like particles between 20-40 nm were seen in the cytoplasm (Figs. 3B and C, arrowhead). DV and accompanied autophagosome formation were also detected in human monocytes (data not shown). In contrast, uninfected Huh7 cells, no dengue viral particles were detected (Fig. 3A) . Moreover, autophagosome vesicles were not detected in the cells exposed to iDV2 (data not shown). Consistently, we detected the DV2-induced LC3 aggregates around the double membraned autophagosome by immunogold labeling of LC3 under TEM. We also detected DV2-like particle in DV2 infected Huh7 cells ( Fig. 3G and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). We reveal that dengue virus particle, LC3 aggregate and double membrane autophagosome exist in the DV2 infected Huh7 cells, indicating DV can trigger LC3 dot formation and formation of autophagosome-like vesicles.ATG5 is an initiator of autophagosome formation during autophagy progression (Kuma et al., 2004) . To clarify whether DV2-induced autophagosome formation is through ATG5 regulatory system related process, wild-type and ATG5 gene knockout MEF cells infected with DV2 for 36 h were examined for double membrane autophagosome formation. Initially, we demonstrated that DV2 indeed could infect and replicate in both wild-type and ATG5 knockout MEF cells by immunofluorescence analysis using anti-DV2-NS1 antibody (data not shown). In DV2-infected MEF cells, only a few DV2 particles were seen in the region with autophagosome formation compared to DV2infected Huh7 cells. This is probably caused by low infection as well as replication rate in this cell line (Fig. 4E) . After DV2 infection, autophagosome vesicles and virus like particles were detected in wild-type MEF cells (Fig. 3D , arrow: autophagosome; arrowhead: virus like particles) but not in ATG5 knock-out MEF cells (Fig. 3E) . The double membrane autophagosome formation was suppressed while the wild-type ATG5 MEF cells were treated with the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA (Fig. 3F ). Our ultra structure photographs indicate that DV2 can induce autophagosome formation. It is a general event and is mediated by the ATG5 regulatory system. , 2004) . Therefore, it is intriguing to clarify the effect of DV2-induced autophagy on DV2 replication. After DV2 infection of Huh7 cells, extracellular viral titer from the culture supernatant and intracellular viral titers from the infected cells were determined by plaque assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The extracellular DV2 titer increased in DV2 infected Huh7 cells along with the increase of infection time from 12 to 36 h p.i., and then declined at 48 h p.i. (Fig. 4A) . The replication rate reached the maximum at 36 h p.i. DV2 replication was evidently suppressed while autophagy was blocked by 3-MA from 24 h p.i. to 48 h p.i. (Fig. 4A) . In DV2 infected cells, rapamycin was added to further induce autophagy, accordingly the DV2 titer was further increased at 36 and 48 h p.i. In addition, the extracellular DV2 titer increased in DV2 infected Huh7 cells was rapamycin dosage dependent (Fig. 4B ). In contrast, 3-MA suppressed DV2 titer in a dosage dependent manner as well (Fig. 4C) . However, DV2 titer was only suppressed about 50% at highest concentration of 3-MA treatments (10 mM), indicating that autophagic machinery is not the only mechanism for DV2 replication.The DV non-structure protein 1 (NS1) plays a positive role in viral RNA replication, the expression level of NS1 can be used to represent the level of the intracellular DV2 replication (Mackenzie et al., 1996) . Therefore, the level of DV2-NS1 protein in the infected Huh7 cells was labeled by anti-DV2-NS1 antibody and evaluated by flow cytometry. The mean fluorescence of the DV2-NS1 expression in DV2-infected Huh7 cells was approximately 43.8 (Fig. 4D, DV vs. No infection; GM) . Rapamycin treatment of DV2 infected cells increased DV2-NS1 expression to 67.3. In contrast, treatment of DV2 infected cells with 3-MA suppressed DV2-NS1 expression to 16.4 (Fig. 4D) . Taken together, our plaque assay and flow cytometry data demonstrate that both extracellular and intracellular DV titer can be induced by DV induced autophagy. The increase of intracellular virus titer indicates the increase of viral replication.To further verify that DV2 induced autophagy can promote its replication, ATG5 knockout (ATG5-KO) MEF cells were used. The ATG5 protein is essential for the formation of autophagosomal membrane; the ATG12/ATG5 conjugation system was revealed in yeast and confirmed in mammalian cells (Mizushima et al., 2001; Nemoto et al., 2003) . The extracellular DV2 virus titers after infection of wild-type and ATG5 knockout MEF cells for 12 and 24 h were evaluated by plaque assay. Fig. 4E shows that the extracellular DV2 titer from wild-type MEF cells was about 3-fold higher than that from ATG5 knockout cells at 24 h p.i. Our data indicate that ATG5 could not only control autophagosome formation but also affect autophagy related DV2 replication.  Discussion  The present study offers compelling evidence that DV2 infection could trigger autophagy machinery, induce autophagosome formation and promote viral replication in various cell lines. Moreover, ATG5 is involved in the activation of autophagic machinery, autophagosome formation and promotion of DV2 replication (which is different with coronavirus and vaccinia virus).Autophagy can be induced in RNA and DNA viruses infected cells, however the detailed mechanisms are still elusive (Jackson et al., 2005; Nakashima et al., 2006; Prentice et al., 2004) . Currently, three possible mechanisms participating in virusinduced autophagy have been reported. Firstly, double stranded RNA may induce autophagosome formation through reducing PKR activity and down-regulation of mTOR (Talloczy et al., 2002) . Secondly, virus infection can induce autophagosome formation through ER stress (Yorimitsu and Klionsky, 2007) . Thirdly, mTOR positively regulates cellular translation (Wullschleger et al., 2006) . Several viral proteins can block cellular transcription and translation through suppression of mTOR activity, which may also induce autophagosome formation (Kato et al., 2002; Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2006) . However, what mechanism participates in DV infection induce autophagic machinery activation remaining unknown. Our unpublished data unravel the activities of mTOR and p70S6K (the down-stream effector of mTOR) were suppressed by DV2 infection. The suppression was further enhanced or reversed by 3-MA indicating that mTOR is involved in DV2 induced autophagy. DV infection can induce ER stress has been reported (Yu et al., 2006) . ER stress, as has been induced autophagy in DV infection also deserves exploration.Higher viral load correlates with the severity of dengue disease including DHF and DSS (Lei et al., 2001) . Dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, and liver cells are the natural target cells of the virus (Green and Rothman, 2006) . According to the antibody-dependent enhancement hypothesis, anti-DV antibody binding with DV of different serotypes enhances viral entry into the target cells in an Fc receptor dependent or independent manner (Huang et al., 2006; Kliks et al., 1989) . If the secondary infection of DVs is a different serotype, antibody-dependent enhancement may occur, leading to an increased virus titer in the host, promoting progression of the disease from mild DF to severe DHF/DSS. In this study, we unravel that DV2 can induce autophagy activation and autophagy activation can sustain more DV2 replication. Whether viral load induced by antibody-dependent enhancement is via an increased autophagy in DV-infected cells is noteworthy for exploration.Autophagosome formation can increase poliovirus load, suggesting that autophagic machinery plays a favorable role in viral replication (Jackson et al., 2005) . In this study, the increase of viral load was correlated with the increase of GFP-LC3 dot formation and LC3-II formation (Fig. 1D) . Furthermore, both intracellular and extracellular viral loads are increased in the presence of the autophagy inducer rapamycin (Figs. 4B and D) and are reduced in the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA (Figs. 4C and D). And the difference in the viral loads between autophagic and non-autophagic cells is not due to the difference in infection efficiency because the levels of DV2-E protein in these two cell lines detected by immuno-fluorescence analysis were identical (data not shown). In summary, our results clearly indicate that DV2-induced autophagic machinery is favorable for DV2 replication. However, when autophagy is blocked by 3-MA or in ATG5-KO MEF cells, DV2 replication continues but at a reduced level, indicating that autophagic machinery may play a promoting role but not an essential role in DV2 replication. This view is consistent with a previous report (Jackson et al., 2005) , which suggested that DV2 may utilize the autophagic machinery for virus replication. Both of the extracellular and intracellular DV titers can be increased by DV2 induced autophagy (Figs. 4A and D) , indicating that autophagic machinery cannot only assist in conveying DV progeny from autophagosome to outside of the infected cells but also promote the virus replication inside the cells. If that is the case, whether autophagosome is the site for DV replication and what is the underlying mechanism requiring further exploration as well. Differently, ATG5 and/or Beclin-1 are not required for vaccinia virus and coronavirus replication have been reported, indicating that different viruses may utilize different signaling pathway to trigger autophagic machinery and affect viral replication (Wileman, 2006; Zhang et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2007) .In addition, autophagic machinery can block innate antiviral immune responses (IFN-beta) has been reported (Jounai et al., 2007) . Therefore, whether the increase of the viral titer was caused by down-regulation of IFN-beta through autophagy activation should be investigated.  Cell line and virus  Huh7 (human hepatoma cell line) cells were cultured in DMEM, (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Trace BioSciences, Australia) at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 incubator. Wild type mouse embryo-fibroblast (MEF) and ATG5 −/− MEF cells were grown under the same conditions. Cells were infected with DV2 strain PL0146 isolated from Taiwan. The virus was routinely maintained in C6/36 cells. For virus infection, cells were adsorbed with DV2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 at 37°C for 2 h. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated at 37°C in DMEM.  Plaque assay  BHK-21 cells were plated into 12-well plates (2 × 10 2 cells/ well) and cultured in DMEM (GIBCO) under CO 2 -enriched conditions as described above. After adsorption with a seriallydiluted virus solution for 2 h, the solution was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 2% FBS and 0.5% methyl cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Five days postinfection (p.i.), the medium was removed, the cells were fixed, and stained with the crystal violet solution consisting of 1% crystal violet, 0.64% NaCl, and 2% formalin.  Transmission electron microscopy  Thirty-six hours after infection, Huh7 cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer containing 4% sucrose, 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM CaCl 2 , and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide. The cells were further dehydrated with ethanol and embedded with LR White (Agar Scientific, UK). Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and then observed using a Hitachi 7000 transmission electron microscope (TEM; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). For immuno-gold labeling, ultra-thin sections were pretreated with 10% H 2 O 2 for 10 min at room-temperature (RT). After treatment for 30 min at RT with blocking buffer (0.8% BSA in PBS), the ultrathin sections were exposed overnight at 4°C with a 1:10 dilution in blocking buffer of anti-LC3 antibody (Abgent, San Diego, CA, USA). Sections were then exposed for 90 min at RT to similarlydiluted goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with 5-nm gold particles (British Biocell International, Cardiff, UK). Finally, ulttrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and were examined under the TEM.  Immunofluorescence  Cells cultured in 10-cm culture dishes were transfected with 20 μg of pEGFPC1-LC3 or pEGFPC1. The dot formation of GFP-LC3 was detected under a fluorescence microscope (TCS SP2, Leica, USA) after drug treatment and/or DV2 infection. After transient transfection and DV infection, all the cells expressing GFP were counted (total cells). Among them, the cell containing ≧ 5 GFP-LC3 dots formation is defined as auto-phagy positive cells. Therefore, the % of the cells showing significant dots formation is = no. of autophagic cells/no. of total cells expressing GFP.DV2 antigens and lysosome-associated membrane proteins-1 (LAMP1) expression in DV2-infected or drug-treated cells were detected by indirect immunofluorescence labeling. To examine the expression of prM protein of DV2 in the presence of GFP-LC3, the infected cells were fixed and immuno-labeled with anti-DV2-prM monoclonal antibodies (gifts from Dr. Huan-Yao Lei). Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) was applied as the secondary antibody. Non-specific fluorescence was assessed using the secondary antibody. Samples were investigated using laser confocal scanning microscopy (FB1000, Olympus, Japan). Anti-LAMP1 monoclonal-antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) was used to detect the expression of LAMP1 using the aforementioned protocol.  Western blot analysis  Cells were cultured and infected with DV2 in 10-cm culture dishes. The whole cellular extract was subjected to the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) at various time post-infection (p.i.), and the separated proteins were electrically transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore Corporation, USA). The membrane was blocked with the sequential additions of the primary (anti-LC3 Ab; Abcam, USA; anti-β-actin Ab; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) and secondary antibodies, incubation with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) solution for 1 min, and exposure to on XAR film (Eastman Kodak, NY).  Flow cytometry  Cells grown in a 6 cm plate were treated with drugs (3-MA or rapamycin) and/or infected with DV2. The cells were harvested and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde after resuspended in PBS at 36 h p.i. After three PBS washes, cells were exposed to blocking buffer and stained with anti-DV2-NS1 antibody (gifts from Dr. Huan-Yao Lei). Green fluorescent protein (GFP)conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen, USA) was used as the secondary antibody after PBS washing. Cells were assayed using a FACScan fluorescenceactivated cell sorter (BD Biosciences, USA).  Statistical analysis  Data are presented as the mean ± SE. Differences between the test and control groups were analyzed using the Student's t test. Significance was set at P b 0.05.  					1			
23313883	Development of a multiplex one step RT-PCR that detects eighteen respiratory viruses in clinical specimens and comparison with real time RT-PCR	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119668/	Abstract Rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral respiratory infections is crucial for patient management. Multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) is used increasingly to diagnose respiratory infections and has shown to be more sensitive than viral culture and antigen detection. Objective of the present study was to develop a one-step mRT-PCR that could detect 18 respiratory viruses in three sets. The method was compared with real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) for its sensitivity and specificity. Clinical specimens from 843 pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms were used in the study. 503 (59.7%) samples were detected positive by mRT-PCR. Of these 462 (54.8%) exhibited presence of a single pathogen and 41 (4.9%) had multiple pathogens. rRT-PCR detected 439 (52.1%) positive samples, where 419 (49.7%) exhibited one virus and 20 (2.4%) showed co-infections. Concordance between mRT-PCR and rRT-PCR was 91.9% and kappa correlation 0.837. Sensitivity and specificity of mRT-PCR were 99.5% and 83.7% while that of rRT-PCR was 86.9% and 99.4% respectively. Rhinovirus (17.2%) was the most frequently detected virus followed by respiratory syncytial virus B (15.4%), H1N1pdm09 (8.54%), parainfluenza virus-3 (5.8%) and metapneumovirus (5.2%). In conclusion, mRT-PCR is a rapid, cost effective, specific and highly sensitive method for detection of respiratory viruses.	Introduction  Respiratory viral disease is a serious public health problem globally and has social and economic impact. Respiratory viruses cause disease that ranges from mild respiratory illness to fatal pneumonia and contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality worldwide (Williams et al., 2002) . Clinical presentations of respiratory viral infections are very similar to each other and etiological diagnosis based on clinical parameters is difficult. Rapid diagnosis is essential for prompt patient management and public health action.Diagnosis of viral respiratory infections has been based on the use of conventional methods such as isolation by cell culture and antigen detection. Although these methods are effective and often complementary, they have certain limitations. Cell culture is considered to be the "gold standard" for virus detection, but it is too laborious and time consuming. Antigen detection is insufficiently sensitive and/or specific.Sensitivity and specificity of respiratory virus detection have improved considerably with the advent of nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs; Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Fox, 2007; Freymuth et al., 2006; Liolios et al., 2001; Vabret et al., 2000; Weinberg et al., 2004) . To enable a rapid response to a potential outbreak, it is desirable to have fast, accurate and comprehensive diagnostic methods that are capable of detecting simultaneously and subtyping viruses. However, it is very expensive to use virus specific PCR assays. Several groups have developed multiplex RT-PCRs to identify respiratory viruses in clinical samples (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Bharaj et al., 2009; Brittain-Long et al., 2010; Coiras et al., 2004; Gunson et al., 2005; Jansen et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2007; Mahony et al., 2007; Pabbaraju et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009) . The preference of one test over the other depends on its specificity, sensitivity and turnaround time as well as cost in resource limited settings.The purpose of this study was to develop a one step mRT-PCR that could detect respiratory viruses including influenza A viruses, H1N1pdm09, seasonal H1N1, H3N2, influenza B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1, 2, 3, 4, rhinovirus, enterovirus, corona viruses OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1 in three sets in human clinical samples and to compare it with rRT-PCR.  Primer design  Primers used in this assay were designed using dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) technology which allows specific detection of viruses without any non specific amplification (Chun et al., 2007) . Conserved regions of target genes were chosen to design the forward and reverse primers. For mRT-PCR, different viral genes with their PCR product sizes are given in Table 1 . Primer sequences can be provided on request. The above mRT-PCR primers were obtained from Sigma (Bangalore, India). Multiplex RT PCRs were carried out in 3 tubes (sets) (set 1: influenza A, subtype seasonal H1, H3 and pandemic H1 (2009), influenza B; set 2: RSV-A, RSV-B, HMPV, PIV-1, -2, -3; and set 3: PIV-4, corona virus OC43/HKU1, corona virus 229E/NL63, rhinovirus/enterovirus). The mRT-PCR did not differentiate between corona virus OC43 and HKU1; 229E and NL63; and between rhinovirus and enterovirus. Monoplex one step real time RT PCRs (rRT-PCR) for influenza A, subtype seasonal H1, H3, pandemic H1 (2009), influenza B and internal control RnaseP were carried out as per protocol provided by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA (CDC) (CDC protocol, 2009 ). For RSV-A and B, PIV-1, -2, -3, corona virus OC43, 229E, NL63 and rhinovirus, the rRT-PCR assay was performed as described (Gunson et al., 2005) , for HMPV (Maertzdorf et al., 2004) and for PIV-4 as described on the following website www3.appliedbiosystems.com/cms/groups/mcb/cms 088565.pdf. For rRT-PCR, all influenza, RSV-A, rhinovirus, PIV-1, and coronavirus NL63 TaqMan probes were labelled with FAM (fluorescein amidite); RSV-B, PIV-2, -3, -4, coronavirus OC43 and 229E were labelled with VIC. Real time PCR primers and TaqMan probes were obtained from Applied Biosystems, USA.  Viral isolates and clinical samples  Tissue culture grown viruses used as positive controls for influenza B, seasonal influenza A H1N1, H3N2, H1N1pdm09, RSV-A and B, HMPV, PIV-1, -2, -3 and enterovirus. Clinical samples positive for PIV-4, rhinovirus, human corona virus OC43/HKU1 and 229E/NL63 were confirmed by sequencing and used to check primers cross reactivity. Nasal, nasopharyngeal or throat swab specimens of ILI (influenza like illness)/SARI (severe acute respiratory illness) patients collected from July 2009 to August 2011 and referred to National Institute of Virology by different hospitals in Pune for diagnosis of H1N1pdm09 were used in this study. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. A total of 843 clinical specimens of pediatric patients were tested by conventional mRT-PCR and monoplex rRT-PCR. One hundred and fourteen influenza positive samples (27 seasonal H3N2, 27 seasonal H1N1, 29 H1N1pdm09 and 31 influenza B) were used for validation of the multiplex assay set 1.  RNA extraction  RNA was extracted using the MagMax automated RNA extractor as per manufacturer's instructions. Fifty microlitres of clinical sample was used for RNA extraction and finally eluted in 50 l of elution buffer.  Conventional multiplex RT-PCR  Amplification for conventional mRT-PCR was carried out on GeneAmp PCR System 9700 using Invitrogen Superscript III one step RT-PCR kit. Master mix for mRT-PCR comprised of 25 l 2× buffer, 2 l enzyme mix, 20 M of forward and reverse primer each and 19 l of RNA template to make a 50 l reaction. Negative and positive controls were run with each experiment. Thermal cycling conditions were 50 • C for 30 min for reverse transcription, initial denaturation at 94 • C for 10 min, 45 cycles of three steps −15 s at 94 • C, 60 s at 55 • C, 45 s at 68 • C, and final extension at 68 • C for 5 min. 10 l of PCR products were mixed with gel loading dye and run on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualized on a UV transilluminator.  Real time RT-PCR  Real time RT-PCR assay was performed on Applied Biosystems' ABI 7500 machine using Invitrogen Superscript III one step qRT-PCR kit. A typical 25 l PCR reaction comprised of 10 M of each forward and reverse primer, 5 M of TaqMan probe, 12.5 l 2× buffer, 0.5 l Superscript III enzyme and 5 l RNA template. Thermal cycling conditions for rRT-PCR were 50 • C for 30 min for reverse transcription, initial denaturation at 94 • C for 5 min, 45 cycles of 15 s at 94 • C, 45 s at 55 • C.  Specificity and analytical sensitivity of conventional mRT-PCR  The specificity of the multiplex PCR assay was evaluated by cross reaction tests with known viral isolates and different panels of sequence confirmed known clinical respiratory samples as reference material. The assay set 1 was also tested on influenza A H5N1, H11N1, H9N2, and newcastle disease virus procured from National Institute of Virology's virus repository and WHO (World Health Organization) influenza panel for QA/QC.To analyze sensitivity, known positive samples were subjected to monoplex PCR. The forward primer was tagged with T7 promoter and by gel electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel, bands of expected size were observed. These bands were extracted from agarose gel using Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany). Purified PCR product was quantified using a Nanoplex nanophotometer (Implant, Germany). In vitro transcription was carried out using RiboMax T7 in vitro transcription system from Promega as per manufacturer's instructions (Promega, USA). Further, RNA was purified using Qiagen's RNA extraction kit and estimated using the Nanoplex nanophotometer. RNA copy number was calculated and 10 fold serial dilutions of the in vitro RNA were performed. Copy number referred to the number of copies of the target gene used to ascertain the limit of detection of the assay. The concentrations tested for each target in set 1 were 10 6 to 10 copies and in sets 2 and 3 were 10 7 copies to 1 copy of template RNA per reaction.The limit of detection (LOD) was defined as the lowest concentration at which each target could be detected consistently. PCR products were detected by gel electrophoresis. Positive controls were prepared by pooling in vitro RNA of each set.  Gene sequencing  Initial PCR was set up using monoplex primers for the relevant target gene with the same mastermix composition and thermal cycling conditions as described for the mRT-PCR. PCR product was purified using Qiagen's PCR purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified product was used to set up cycle sequencing reaction with each sequencing primer as follows: mastermix: 5× sequencing buffer -2 l, cycle sequencing reaction mix RR100 -2 l, primer -1 l, DDW -3 l and template -2 l. Thermal cycling conditions: 95 • C for 5 min; 25 cycles of 94 • C −15 s, 50 • C for 10 s and 60 • C for 4 min. The above cycle sequencing product was purified using Qiagen's DyeEx cycle sequencing purification kit as per manufacturer's instructions. Applied Biosystems 3730xl 96 capillary sequencer was used for sequencing and results were analyzed using sequencing analysis 5.2 software. The sequences were confirmed using NCBI BLAST.  Statistical analyses  Statistical analysis was carried out using PASW Statistics 18 software. The agreement between two diagnostic tests was calculated by means of concordance and kappa statistics. The sensitivity and specificity of one test with reference to the other and vice versa were also computed.  Specificity and sensitivity of mRT-PCR  Specificity of the mRT-PCR assay was evaluated by cross reaction tests against known respiratory virus isolates/positive samples and a WHO QA/QC panel for influenza viruses showed no cross reactivity amongst different viruses. A product of the expected size was obtained for each viral target in the presence of all the primers of the respective multiplex PCR and the specific products could be distinguished on agarose gel electrophoresis based on their size. For confirmation of the observed bands, sequencing of the amplified PCR products was carried out. For validation of set 1 of the multiplex assay, 114 respiratory clinical specimens previously positive for influenza viruses by rRT-PCR were used and results were 100% concordant. Co-infection was observed in one sample where both seasonal influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 detected, this was confirmed by sequencing of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes. Set 1 of the mRT-PCR detected specifically only H1N1pdm09, seasonal H1N1, H3N2 and all other influenza-A viruses were detected as a universal influenza-A product of 450 bp. In the WHO Influenza panel, 3 samples exhibited bands corresponding to influenza-A only. These samples were confirmed as influenza A H5N1 by sequencing the matrix gene.Analytical sensitivity of the conventional multiplex assay was determined by testing 10 fold serial dilutions of the quantified RNA transcripts of each target. Set 1 detected 100 RNA copies per reaction for each target. Set 2 detected RSV-A at 10 copies per reaction; HMPV, PIV-1, -2 and -3 at 100 copies per reaction and RSV-B at 1000 RNA copies per reaction. Set 3 detected enterovirus at 1 copy per reaction; PIV4, rhinovirus and corona OC43/HKU1, 229E/NL63 at 1000 RNA copies per reaction in the mRT-PCR. The experiments were repeated three times using all three sets to obtain consistent limits of detection for each virus in the mRT-PCR Table 1 ).Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/ j.jviromet.2012.12.017.Overall, concordance between both the methods was 91.9% and kappa correlation was 0.837. Sensitivity and specificity of mRT-PCR were 99.5% and 83.7% respectively considering rRT-PCR as the "gold standard". Conversely sensitivity and specificity of rRT-PCR were 86.9% and 99.4% respectively considering mRT-PCR as the "gold standard" (Table 2) . For seasonal H3N2, H1N1pdm09, influenza B, RSV-A and B and PIV-2, 100% concordance were observed using both the methods. The sensitivity and specificity for rhinovirus using mRT-PCR were 96.6 and 92.2% and rRT-PCR were 59.3% and 99.6% respectively. Thirty seven out of 59 samples positive for rhinovirus/enterovirus in mRT-PCR but negative by rRT-PCR were selected randomly and sequenced for the 5 -UTR region. Sequencing result confirmed 34 samples as rhinovirus (91.9%) and 3 as enterovirus (8.1%).For HMPV, sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 97.6% for mRT-PCR while the sensitivity and specificity were 54.6% and 100% respectively for rRT-PCR. The 20 samples positive in the mRT-PCR, but negative by rRT-PCR was confirmed to be positive for HMPV by sequencing. Sensitivity and specificity by mRT-PCR were 100% and 99.4% for PIV-3 and those for rRT-PCR were 89.8% and 100% respectively. Among PIV-3 positive clinical samples, approximately 15% samples showed amplification bands corresponding to PIV-1 and PIV-2 which were tested further using monoplex primers. They were negative for PIV-1 and PIV-2 indicating that the bands were nonspecific. For PIV-4, the sensitivity and specificity were 50% and 100% for rRT-PCR respectively. Four out of the 5 samples negative by rRT-PCR were sequenced and found to be PIV-4. Randomly selected 8 corona virus OC43/HKU1 positive samples were sequenced and confirmed as corona virus OC43. Rhinovirus [145/843 (17.2%) ] was the respiratory virus detected most frequently followed by RSV-B in 130 samples (15.4%), H1N1pdm09 in 72/843 (8.5%), PIV-3 in 49 samples (5.8%) and HMPV in 44 samples (5.2%). Corona virus 229E was detected in 4 samples by rRT-PCR. As shown in supplementary Table 1 , rhinovirus was detected most frequently in co-infection followed by RSV. All coinfections were confirmed by performing monoplex PCRs with their respective primers.  Discussion  Major respiratory viral pathogens recorded globally are RSV, influenza virus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus and bocavirus. A number of studies have attempted for development and evaluation of multiplex PCRs for detection of various respiratory viruses (Auburn et al., 2011; Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Boonsuk et al., 2008; Brittain-Long et al., 2010; Coiras et al., 2004; Jansen et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2009; Mahony et al., 2007; Suwannakarn et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009) . This is the first study using single step mRT-PCR for the detection of 18 respiratory viruses from clinical specimens.For the conventional mRT-PCR, conserved regions of genes were selected (Table 1) . Each set in the assay produced distinctively sized PCR products which could be visualized and easily differentiated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The only limitation of this multiplex PCR is lack of an internal control to check quality of the samples.The mRT-PCR is sensitive as determined by testing 10 fold serial dilutions of quantified RNA transcripts of each target. Multiplex PCR set 1 detected 100 RNA copies/reaction for each target which is comparable with multiplex PCR developed by Kim et al. (2009) . An influenza typing kit available commercially, the Seeplex A/B typing kit has a sensitivity and specificity of 83.7% and 100% in detecting H1N1pdm09 when compared to the CDC real time RT-PCR (Choi et al., 2010) while sensitivity and specificity of our mRT-PCR was 100%, showing excellent concordance with CDC's real time RT-PCR.Multiplex RT-PCR detected 503 (59.7%) samples positive for one or more of the respiratory viruses listed above and real time PCR detected 439 (52.1%) samples as positive (supplementary Table 1 ). This low detection rate by rRT-PCR was mainly due to the low sensitivity of detecting rhinovirus and metapneumovirus. Previously, detection rates between 43% and 63% have been reported (Brittain-Long et al., 2010; Broor et al., 2007; Coiras et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2009; Mahony et al., 2007; Maitreyi et al., 2000; Yeolekar et al., 2008) . Co-infections have been described previously in approximately 5-20% of infected patients in different studies (Brittain-Long et al., 2010; Coiras et al., 2004 , Kim et al., 2009 Mahony et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2010) .One of the biggest advantages of mRT-PCR is its ability to detect co-infections which are often undetected in viral culture with immunofluorescence detection. Several cases of co-infection were detected using both the PCR methods. Multiplex RT-PCR detected 41 (4.9%) samples with co-infection including 3 samples in which 3 viruses were detected whereas rRT-PCR detected 20 (2.4%) samples with co-infection. One case of co-infection with influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses was also detected. Co-infection with different influenza viruses occurs naturally and plays an important role in evolution, epidemiology and pathogenicity of the virus.Concordance between both the methods was 100% for seasonal H1N1, H3N2, H1N1pdm09, influenza B, PIV-2, RSV-A and B. Lower detection rates by rRT-PCR were due to the lower sensitivity of this system for rhinovirus and HMPV. This may be due to sequence variation in primer probe binding regions in Indian subtypes. Frequency of PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-4 and coronavirus was low; a larger number of samples are required to better assess their clinical sensitivity and specificity.The multiplex RT-PCR scores over the monoplex rRT-PCR in a resource limited settings. The cost of mRT-PCR for the 18 viruses discussed here is approximately US$ 27 whereas for the real time PCRs it is US$ 45. Moreover, the real time PCR machines are very expensive when compared to a conventional thermal cycler.  Conclusion  The one step multiplex RT-PCR assay developed in the present study provides a simple, rapid and cost effective method for the detection of 18 different respiratory viruses from human clinical specimens. The mRT-PCR is as sensitive and as specific as rRT-PCR based assay. This mRT-PCR assay can be used for respiratory virus surveillance as well as diagnosis.  				1	1
